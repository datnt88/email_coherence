don't the more expensive towers come with more/better fans? 
this is going to run kinda warm isn't it? 
so i want to keep it nice and cool. 
i plan to game at full hd resolution with bf3 being my benchmark game. 
hoping to run it on ultra or near to that settings at 30+ fps. 
would you still reccomend the hd 7850 over the gtx 660 (non ti version) for this resolution? 
i see people are saying the hd 7550/7870 really come into their own element at higher resolutions than this but that full hd and under that the gtx 660 would be better? 
would you agree with that ?
