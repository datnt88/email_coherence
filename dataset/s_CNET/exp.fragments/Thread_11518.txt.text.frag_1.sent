i have specialist lab software installed on an old pc running under windows98....working fine, but i've lost the original software cds, so can't reinstall if/when my pc hard drive dies. 
software connects to lab hardware via a slot-in card, so transfer to a whole new pc may be problematic, but could i make a replacement internal hard drive in case my present one dies, and if so how? 
any other work arounds? the lab software is no longer available (10 years old) even from the software originator (i asked). 
i'm not even clear as to whether i can now buy any software that'll talk to my lab hardware correctly. 
help!
