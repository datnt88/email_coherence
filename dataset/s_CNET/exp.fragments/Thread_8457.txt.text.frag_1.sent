i have a radeon hd 4850 and i thought i'd replace the fan on my card to cool it better today. 
so i bought a fan and was going to install it. 
i took out my card (with a little difficulty...just tinkered with it a bit but ended up getting it out seemingly fine). 
i took off the fan, and decided instead to do it later. 
so i put the old fan back on the card, put the card back into my pc and now i can't see anything on my monitor. 
i think i put everything in properly, and made sure there wasn't excess dust or anything. 
what could possibly be wrong?
