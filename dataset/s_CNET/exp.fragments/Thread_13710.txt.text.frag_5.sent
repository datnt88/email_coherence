the fastest chip on the market to day would have to be the amd athlon 64 fx55. 
it isn't as versatile as the intel p4ee 3.6ghz chip but it wins hands down in every other category. 
the lack of ddr2 however, keeps me away from the amd chip for now. 
but the boards are coming. 
g5? i have no idea, i don't work with macs, sorry.
