i have redone an older dell desktop for my dad and changed to a widescreen monitor but cannot get aspect ratio correct. 
output to monitor is for standard size monitor so that makes everything short and fat. 
how do i change to widescreen. 
i am running xp with sp3 monitor is viewsonic brand. 
any ideas???
