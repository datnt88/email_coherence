thanks willy for the details. 
that link seems interesting - i guess the mindset for building workstations hasn't changed so much as the actual hardware. 
i am a little confused by your post's title though, because i monitor the memory usage when my programme runs and i have never run out of memory. 
so will more ram still be helpful in that situation?
