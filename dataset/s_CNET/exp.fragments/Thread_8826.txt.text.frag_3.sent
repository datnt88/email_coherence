bob, thanks for the reply. 
i had just finished reading the long discussion on your link when i received your reply. 
i forgot to mention in my firest post that i have windows live onecare on both systems. 
i went into settings on both systems and changed a few things, the opened network setup wizard on both machins and went through the process again. 
when finished, i had another printer icon on printers and faxes window on notebook. 
it was check marked, auto hp psc series on hpdesktop. 
under the ports tab, there is a check next to..\d...local port auto hp psc 2200 series on hpdesktop. 
i am able to print wireless now. 
now when i right click a folder to share on either machine, the area is greyed out next to &quot;share this folder on the network&quot;. 
cannot put a check into box. 
i chose, share files and printers on setup wizard. 
also, at the top of my outlook express email window, print is grayed out on the tosbiba notebook. 
if i right click a message, print is grayed out on that window also. 
not sure if any of this is relative to first post, but thanks for any more tips.
