just sharing. 
i've run across a few instances where the owner choose &quot;maximum security&quot; on the firewall. 
yup. 
no internet. 
you write &quot;yet when i connect to the router via a cable, i do get internet. 
what is wrong?&quot; 
i can't tell. 
maybe you need to setup the router per our forum sticky but i see nothing about your router make, model, firmware version etc. there were some out of date routers that didn't hand out the dns proper to new machines but the lack of detail in your post can't have me say that's the issue.
