ii did a quick bit of research at the apple store and it woud seem tht only the macbook pro has a wireless card that is capable of &quot;n&quot;, via a firmware update. 
you might want to call apple to confirm/deny that. 
i could not find anywhere that specifically stated that the macbook could not be updated.
