okay i assemble computers and i have had my share with hardware configuration problems . 
when get my parts from the distributer , i check them . 
i start in the following manner . 
i install the processor on the motherboard with the heatsink . 
then put the memory in the slots . 
connect it to the monitor and power up . 
if i get the mobo logo and bios reading on the monitor i proceed further . 
if not , i retrace my steps . 
in your case , your graphic card and mobo came true ( seems to me ) . 
since you tested with both of your ram sticks , it very unlikely that your both ram sticks have gone bad at the same time . 
it could be your processor , but , before your start ripping off your hardware to get to your cpu , i would strongly suggest you to take a look at your power supply ( smps ) . 
make sure you are using one of a correct wattage rating and of a reputable brand . 
i have found cheap ones saying 650 watt but they fail to even give 450 watt . 
looks to me as if you are having a &quot;brown out &quot; condition . 
hope this helps sam
