this sounds like you are having a power supply problem. the power supply is alot like a car battery in that it can have enough power to run the radio and lights but not enough to start the car. 
i would get a new power supply and install it in that machine. 
if you do not know what size to buy here is a handy rule of thumb: for each hard drive, floppy, cd rom, dvd rom you have in your machine figure on 60 watts each. 
then for each additional board you have, video, audio, lan, etc., add 25 watts each for those. 
then add 150 watts for the processor and you should have enough. 
most machines can do fine with 300 watts. 
i will not install anything less than a 400 watt just to be on the safe side. 
i hope this helps you!
