hey guys, i thought this might be better suited in a new post. 
i posted yesterday about how i was in the market to add a new internal hard drive to my computer. 
now the problem that i have is that i opened up my computer to check it out and realized that i don't have an extra bay to insert another hard drive.....all the bays are taken up (1 hd, 2 cdrw, 1 3.5 in floppy).....what do i do now? 
some people have said to buy a 2 bay 3.5 in cage and insert the old hard drive and new one into that in replace of the 1 bay cage i have. 
my computer is a dell dimension 2350. 
i was thinking about adding the cage but they're hard to find and it sounds like a lot of work for something that you could fix with an external drive. 
anyone have any suggestions as to my newest problem? 
thanks in advance to everyone.
