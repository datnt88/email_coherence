your best bet is to optimize what you have. 
i have a few k6-2-400's and maybe one last k6-3-400 kicking around the lab, so i'll share my housecleaning &quot;upgrade.&quot; 1. eject all parasites with the help of the anti-parasite suite i wrote about at 2. run disk cleanup. 
3. uninstall all programs you haven't run in 1 year. 
think brutal. 2 months? 1 month? 
a full disk runs much slower than an empty drive. 
4. review the optimizing windows article at 5. use the last version of motherboard, video and audio drivers noted for your selected os. if linux, then go get a new distro. 
very nice. 
best of luck, i'll get the broom.
