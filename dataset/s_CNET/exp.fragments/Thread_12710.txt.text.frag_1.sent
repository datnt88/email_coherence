a: drive has gone missing from mycomputer and when i enter a: at the dos command prompt i get the message &quot;the system cannot find the drive specified&quot;. 
i have tried all the usual things in troubleshooter and device manager and the floppy disk drive appears to be working except that it is not there! an internet search reveals nothing of immediate use, anybody know how to get the floppy disk drive back on screen? 
thanks peter a
