i don't know really anything about routing tables. 
let me tell you why i'm asking. 
i'm looking for a solution to offer some accounts i'm working with. 
i wouldn't be setting this up i'd just like to know if it is possible between say a dsl connection and a cable connection and if it is a pricey option. 
thanks!
