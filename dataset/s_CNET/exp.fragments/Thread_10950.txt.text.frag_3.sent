it is impossible for me to run an ethernet cable all across the house, i think this is exactly what i need. the $50 adapter would suffice for me but do you if this whole setup would work? 
i.e. hdtv signal to computer via network, connect the adapter to the tv/stereo system itself? 
thanks for your input.
