folk made such things. 
they were awfully expensive as each card was essentially a pc on a card. 
since it was not made in the volumes of your common pc or laptop the prices were always more than your pc. but folk always tried such things. 
today i rarely seen a citrix or windows terminal system because the pc is too cheap.
