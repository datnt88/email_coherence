i also discovered that turning of norton firewall security on both my vista laptop and my xp desktop solved the problem. 
i now just have to figure out the best firewall settings to use before i re-enable them. 
i also run ubuntu dapper drake linux on another machine and still have to figure out how to get this to access the vista machine, it works ok the other way round (vista can access ubuntu files). 
any suggestions on this one. 
i also suggest that the following site is well worth the money, if you want to save yourself endless hours of sleep and trudging through endless books and web pages.
