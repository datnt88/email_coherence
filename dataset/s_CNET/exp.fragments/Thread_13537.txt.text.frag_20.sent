(sorry, this is a duplicate post to the first poll message, didn't know about the 'how' poll til later). 
i use/make at least two cds (using a different manufacturer's cd for each, to lessen any potential writing problems). 
then i read each (in another cd reader), and get copy of its contents (using cmd (or, command ) dir /s /s &gt; filenamedateetc.xxx). the contents file provides a neat way to search for a specific file, when i need to find it).
