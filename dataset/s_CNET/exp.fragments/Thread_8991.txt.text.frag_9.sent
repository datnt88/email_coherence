the repeating cause is wep. it does that if one character is off in the password. 
this is one reason among the security issue with wep i move to wpa. and in this forum is our preferred router wifi settings. 
share those. 
also, be careful not to have 2 wifi managers. 
my old laptop was loaned out and somehow they turned on the second wifi connection manager. 
sorry, no but i can't recall or know all the methods to get this back to just one. 
but i'm leaning to always using the windows wireless zero configuration tool for all machines.
