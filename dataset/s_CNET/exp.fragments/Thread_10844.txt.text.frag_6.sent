and for bearing with me on this question. 
i have already done a lot of reading on this question, and have never understood anything i read. 
i think i'm starting to understand it a tinsy bit better, except i'm still confused why people do so much talking about re-formatting. the way they talk, it makes me think it is something that i should be doing, however, after receiving your response, i guess it is actually something i should not be doing. 
thanks again for your help.
