you have a working hd, then back-up any critical data. 
you want the easy way out. the plain fact is any so-called s/w that does this will claim, &quot;back-up&quot; before use anyways. 
you proceed at your own risk using whatever s/w. 
take that as a warning and decide whta you want to do. 
quite franky, if you have another hd, then clone one drive to another. 
once you verify everything is ok, then re-use the hd and reformat it to the way you want it. 
you mentioned w98 disk and fdisk, these are old os tools, so just what are your end uses? 
devide a 64gb hd may not if you use xp or better in more than 2 partitions wouldn't provide much storage once done, etc. even, if you did this and then try using in w98 setup, that won't work period or hic-up in some way. 
. 
checkout parition magic and/or gparted or even norton's old ghost s/w. 
freebies or shareware, check website filebases for all that. 
i look at these or goolge away: check below and find the downloads area of cnet as well for any helpful s/w.
