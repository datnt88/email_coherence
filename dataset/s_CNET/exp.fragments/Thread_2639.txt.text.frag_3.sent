i don' have any cds, which is why i'm stuck. 
i've came across the drivers and they don't do anything unless i have the program installed. 
giga pocket is a dead end, unless i find a torrent which i can't find. 
i just need an alternative program that can do the same thing giga pocket does, which is have the program record from the av/component cables in my video card onto the desktop.
