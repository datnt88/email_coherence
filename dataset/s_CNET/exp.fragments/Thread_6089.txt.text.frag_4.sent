thank you bob and willy. 
my zip drives are now going to the junk pile. 
only thing that i don't like is, the files on the disks, i can not retrieve unless i send them to iomega and for a price they will get the files off. 
this i don't intend to do, as they got enough of my money. 
also they are of no help with the problem. 
thanks for your replies, larry
