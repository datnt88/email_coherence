the only item i see to a bottleneck for gamers is that geforce fx 5200-256 video card. 
look at and while it's better than what we had years ago, it's still at the bottom of the heap. 
i.e. a &quot;value&quot; card. 
you can save yourself time and money if you just picked out a nice video card. 
that will give you the biggest bang.
