review any options, preferences, or startup portion to see if you can change it. 
once done, check it out. 
if nothing seems to address the issue, look at the msconfig file. 
goto-&gt;start-&gt;run-&gt;type in msconfig-&gt;click startup button-&gt;uncheck lightroom2-&gt;save or apply and exit out. 
you may have to reboot and try it. 
if none of this works, uninstall lightroom2 entirely. 
make note where you installed 1st(directory) and totally delete it once the uninstall procedure has been done. 
reboot and then re-install lightroom2, if it requires some preference then, make note of it. 
here you can now change how you want it to load.
