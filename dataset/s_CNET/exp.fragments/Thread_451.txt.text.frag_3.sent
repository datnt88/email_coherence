i've run into similiar problems, particularly with my pro system (have 1 98, 1 xp home laptop, and my main system with pro). 
bob mentioned zonealarm, which i use. 
in the firewall configuration, i added the ip addresses of all the computers, and the full range of addresses, e.g, 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.40. 
in addition, and this seems to have caused me the most problem, xp's firewall often automagically turns itself on, so in in the local area connection properties&gt;advanced, i disable the xp firewall. 
i have the most problems with my pro system. the 98 system never has a problem, lol. 
so much for 'upgrades'. 
hope this was of some help.
