just curious, just how easy will it be to put non-dell stuff into a dell? 
i have no direct experience with them but when i help friends who own dells and gateways it always seems like the companies tell me &quot;you can't add that component to the system unless you buy one of ours.&quot; you're married to them and their bios downloads and whatnot . 
. . 
any real mucking about (like overclocking) can void the warranty real fast and you're back here talking to us ! 
(not that there's anything wrong with that) in my experience, my home built computers are more expensive to start but they are a lot more expandable (at least in the near run, before the whole system becomes obsolete) in terms of adding cards and drives and so on . . . 
and what can i say, i love messing around with this stuff.
