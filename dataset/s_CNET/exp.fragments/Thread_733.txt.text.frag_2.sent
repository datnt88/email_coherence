keep reading these forums and you find that it's not a backup but a fast copy since there is no backup copy somewhere else plus the drive has no write protection feature. 
most of the losses appear to be bad luck (dropped the drive) to malware (which is where that write protection matters.) i'd think it over how to get a real backup system going.
