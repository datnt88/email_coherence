nvmm = non-volatile memory module or eeprom(bios) my educated guess in this matter. 
the only reason you're getting any error message are the small routines buried in the bios. 
(--) maybe the only characters it can access within its limited memory space as it could be any character(s). 
imho, evga, is a cheap outfit as they been offering items on their own recently and mostly at the bottom end. 
only now do i see high prcied offering, but i avoid such myself.
