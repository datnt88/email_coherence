right or wrong, that step seems to make too many wifi setups unstable or unusable. 
in fact my palm tx will not play with the home wifi setup unless ssid is visible. 
i will not discuss why this is so. 
however i will note that by using the other security items such as mac filtering and wep or wpa i haven't found a smart enough cracker to leech a free ride. 
hope this helps, bob
