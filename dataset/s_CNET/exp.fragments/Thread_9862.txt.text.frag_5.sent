i don't use that one. it was just too flighty. 
i did update the firmeware to the befw11s4 and it worked great. 
my dad's router died so i shipped him my bef and now have some dlink 524 router (which i also got to update the firmware.) here's the recap: 1. latest firmware for the befw11s4 or don't complain. 
2. consider the wusb11 may be not that great with your selected os or system. 
if latest firmware and drivers don't make it work, then toss it. 
remember to get it all working without firewalls or wep before you turn on the security.
