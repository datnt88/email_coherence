hi! my mother (you may recall previous posts) finally hired a &quot;come-to-your-house&quot; tech to get her hp presario/windows xp computer to work right again. 
(long story.) he finally took it to his shop to finish the work, and now says that windows xp has &quot;crashed&quot; and he needs her recovery disk which she does not have. 
(no cds came with it--just &quot;hidden partition.&quot;) 
i've read here that she can order them from hp; but i'm wondering if i can make one on my pc (ours are exactly the same) to give to the tech to use on hers? 
you people who answer questions from novices like me are absolutely terrific. 
i look forward once again to your recommendations and advice. 
thanks! 
ellie howe
