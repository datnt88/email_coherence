because raid 1 recovery is very unsure and unsafe to the files on the raid 1 set. 
if you had not mentioned raid i would have linked to the cnet storage forum &quot;lost and found&quot; sticky top post where there are many recovery titles for free and free to try. 
but your post had raid so i have to defer to the safest methods. 
i can't help people destroy their last copy of their files. 
hope you understand, bob
