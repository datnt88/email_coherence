hello, cnet forum: recently i needed to format my computer and reinstall everything. 
everything's set up correctly again, with one annoying exception- i can't get my computer to recognize and use the front audio panel of my antec sonata ii case. the internal wiring between the panel and my ga-8i915p duo pro motherboard hasn't changed, and my bios is at its latest version (and has the option to automatically recognize the azalia codec enabled, and the type set to &quot;ac'97&quot; (as opposed to hd audio, which never worked) under the bios settings). 
i have the codecs from this site (the 1st winxp compatible linked downloadable file) but when i install them, the only available options from the &quot;default playback&quot; drop down menu under the audio tab of the sound and audio devices applet from control panel are my: -sound blaster 4 audigy se (really a misnomer on sb's part, but nm) -a modem #0 line playback, and a -hd audio rear output (the speakers ports built into my motherboard itself). 
doing some research (cursory, only) off of google led me to downloading the codecs below (c-media cmi9880 driver (windows xp/2000) 62.64) but they seem nearly exactly the same as the c-media audio codec/driver i previously downloaded off of windows update which 1) seemingly changed the name of the default playback option &quot;hd audio rear output&quot; to &quot;c-media audio rear output&quot; only 2) caused the dr watson post mortem debugger to screw up explorer everytime my computer restarted due to something related to msconfig & startup (which i fixed by uninstalling the windows-update provided c-media installation). 
i know for a fact that pre-format my front audio panel worked just fine using the codecs available from the site linked to from the first hyperlink pasted above. 
i am not sure why the exact same setup no longer works. 
i would greatly appreciate any help from more experienced cnet troubleshooters, and gladly give my thanks in advance for your efforts on my behalf. 
kind regards, tom
