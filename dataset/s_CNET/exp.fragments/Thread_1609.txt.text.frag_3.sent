thanks for your reply. it seems that the primary use for external drives is data backup. 
usb max speed is 480 mb/s and the sata is 3000 mb/s. 
i want to have max speed for i/o operations due to a small but very speedy ssd drive. 
most of the separate enclosures with sata connections also have usp ports for data and/or power. 
your point is correct that the usb allows use with other slower computers but this should be available with the box hooked up usb.
