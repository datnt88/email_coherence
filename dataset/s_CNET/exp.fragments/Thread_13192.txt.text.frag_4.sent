i've got 4 mb of ram on my vista 32-bit home premium setup (a friend had 2 mb left over after a rebuild of his machine, so i figured there's nothing to lose by adding them to the 2 mb that came with the hp pavilion m8100y). the system recognizes 3.25 mb of that 4 mb, so that means 0.75 mb is not being used for anything that i can tell. 
if it weren't free, i wouldn't have added the last mb. 
does the extra 1.25 mb make a difference? 
yes!! i run ms flight simulator x on this machine, which is well-documented memory hog. the extra ram allows me to turn up many of the reality settings, which make the simulation much more realistic. 
i don't know what else the extra ram can do, but it helps this game a great deal.
