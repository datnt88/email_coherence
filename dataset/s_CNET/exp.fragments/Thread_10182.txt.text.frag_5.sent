the class of machine you are looking at was plagued with far too many issues. the athlon core would vaporize in a split second (watch ) and far too many had the bad caps issue. 
unless you can get it all for free it's not a good deal. it would be a shame to spend one dime and then discover why the machine was stripped and set aside. 
if you want something small and nice i'll share i picked up that 350 buck acer aspire one. 
it's been a hoot.
