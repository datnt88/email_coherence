i have an hp d2430 printer that i use with my compaq v6444us notebook when i'm away from home. 
yesterday, a dialog box appeared with &quot;solution center the feature you are trying to use is on a cd-rom or other removeable disk that is not available. 
insert the &quot;solution center&quot; disk and click ok.&quot; since i was not trying to &quot;use anything&quot;, i don't know why this dialog box appeared. 
this printer is just that ... a printer only which works great. 
how do i keep this message from reappearing? 
thank you.
