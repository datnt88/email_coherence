he wants to know what he should upgrade to run regular programs. 
not games. 
and you video card costs more than his system is worth. 
if he had that kind of sqrill he would have probably just bought a new rig a long time ago. 
i mean, he isn't even running 933mhz. 
you vid card runs at atleast 550mhz if you got the good one.
