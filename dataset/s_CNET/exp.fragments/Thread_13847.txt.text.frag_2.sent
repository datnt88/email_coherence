if you are copying files with windows explorer to/from some other pc or nas, such speeds you noted are normal even with a gigabit network. 
why is well discussed so i'll suggest you try other speed tests. 
a common gaffe is home made cables. 
folk always get the pairs wrong and some are so upset about that that they'll stamp their feet and insist the pairs are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8.
