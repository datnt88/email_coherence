ok, here is a list i was able to compile. 
does it matter if i upgrade to athlon and not sempron? 
amd athlon 64 3800+ 2.40ghz processor $30 amd athlon 64 4000+ 2.6ghz 512kb l2 cache socket am2 62w single-core processor amd athlon le-1600 (adh1600dhbox) 2.2ghz amd athlon le-1620 (adh1620dhbox) 2.4ghz $53 amd sempron le-1300 (sdh1300dpbox)2.3ghz 
$39 amd sempron le-1250 (sdh1250dpbox)2.2ghz 
$29 amd athlon le-1640 (adh1640dpbox) 2.6ghz $38 i think these are all 939 sockets but they also call them amd2 sockets? 
i hope you all have some answers for me. 
thanks, ken
