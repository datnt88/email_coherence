since you've said you're not interesting in sli/crossfire, a 500w unit should suffice. 
the corsair 620w is $170 while the 520w is $125 (from newegg). 
either of these 500w power supplies are good alternatives also. 
antec neohe 500, $80: coolermaster real power pro rs-550, $99: as for a case, that's mostly a matter of choice. 
side window? 
drive door? 
flashy lights? 
i'm a big fan of the coolermaster cavalier and mystique cases. 
cavalier, $75 (also avail in silver): mystique, $75:
