i also had no problem with mine until 3 weeks after purchase. 
then it started. 
checked temps with ir and found nothing overheating. 
after downloading a vista update, problem went away for about 2 weeks and then returned. 
then checked ms technet and there was 1 person that had overcome the problem by changing the fan speed settings in bios. 
changed processing zone response to &quot;aggressive&quot;, processing zone damping to &quot;high&quot; and automatic fan detect to &quot;always&quot;. 
i changed mine 3 hours ago and so far, no problem. 
i've also seen no change in temps, but fan does overspeed for a few seconds at start up.
