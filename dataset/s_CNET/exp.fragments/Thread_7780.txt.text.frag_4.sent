having the exact problem with new dell. 
i added a 2nd hd. all o.k. for 2 months or so then bam, i turned the computer on, and get message that neither of my hds are found - bios shows drives as &quot;unknown&quot;, both are set to auto. 
i checked all connections, reseated memory, unplugged and replugged cables. 
got same message only this time f1 started it up to the os (xp). 
ran dell diagnostics - everything passed. 
restarted, same thing all over again. 
hds not found. 
(floppy and cd drives work fine).any 
suggestions?
