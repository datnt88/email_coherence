maybe i have just been lucky but my dell's and mac's have had no issues with wpa2. 
i didn't know other have had issues. 
everything i read so far on clint ap isolation talks about how it prevents one wireless client from communicating with another wireless client. 
if that also works on the wired ports it could be a good start to a real dmz. 
i just haven't read anything that says it works on wired ports yet or had a chance to test it.
