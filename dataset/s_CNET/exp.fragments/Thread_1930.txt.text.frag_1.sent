i bought this hard drive internal seagate 2tb green caviar last week. 
i transferred more or less 1tb size of files to this new hard disk without hassle. 
i noticed that when i set this as a directory for my completed downloads in utorrent, it suddenly disappear on my computer icon. 
i check the device manager and it is no longer there. 
i also went looking in the storage management but it wasn't there. 
i try to restart my pc and it go back to normal. 
after this incident, i can no longer transfer file to this new hard drive because it keeps on disappearing and i have to restart my pc over and over again. 
today, the worst thing happen, because it is no longer appearing on my device manager. 
pls help me folks.
