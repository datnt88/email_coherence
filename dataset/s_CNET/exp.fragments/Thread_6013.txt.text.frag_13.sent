i did as the instructions said as such: 1. most of the files above are disk images. 
download the file to your c: drive, put a fresh disk in your a: drive, then click on the file to create the bootdisk. 
from there i'm stuck. 
may be obvious to you but it isn't to me. 
95 is when i got the laptop. 
i am mildly used to working in dos as i haven't bothered with it in eons. 
but some of the commands i'm familiar with.
