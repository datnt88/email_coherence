. in the september 2004 (which is out now, at least here in nyc) issue of a magazine called &quot;computer shopper&quot; (don't know if you can find it online, but if not, it is well worth buying it!) at pp. 117, there is a pretty good article presicely about graphic card. 
i think it costs like $5 and it's worth it to get a cheap advice! .
