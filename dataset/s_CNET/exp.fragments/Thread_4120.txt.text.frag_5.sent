if you're looking to upgrade your videocard, i recommend the radeon 9800 pro. 
since the announcement of the geforce 6800 and the radeon x800, the radeon 9800 pro has dropped in price. 
it's an absolute beezer of a card and has no problems running farcry, halo, painkiller etc. if you can't stretch to the 9800, the 9600xt is still a good card, only cheaper.
