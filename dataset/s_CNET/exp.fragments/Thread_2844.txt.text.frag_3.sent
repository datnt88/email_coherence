you didn't note the os plus what hardware issue you feel may be affecting this. 
hint: you posted in the &quot;pc hardware forum.&quot; for windows 9x/me this article covers it all -&gt; this applies to defragmenting as well as scandisk. 
what i often see is any number of responses that contain bits and pieces of what's in this article, but why not have it all. 
in closing, if you feel this is a hardware issue, tell about what hardware issue you have.
