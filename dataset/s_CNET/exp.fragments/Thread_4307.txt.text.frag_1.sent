i took bmf's advice and upgraded the memory on my 1.67 ghz ppc powerbook (ddr2 sdram pc2-4200s). 
i found the compatible ram (pc2-4200 ddr2 533 mhz) and ordered it from newegg (two kingston kta-pb533/1g one gig sticks). 
i removed the old 512 and inserted the two 1 gig sets. 
when i tried to power back up, all i got was a blank screen, a couple of audible beeps and a sleep indicator light sequence of four flashes and then steady (repeating sequence). 
i took both 1 gig rams out and switched them around but still no luck. 
i put the original 512 back in and stacked one of the 1 gigs on top, still no luck. 
finally, i removed the 1 gig and left just the original 512 in and it worked again... am i failing to do some step before powering back up?
