hey, i just installed the ati theater 550 pro tv tuner card, and i want to play my ps2 on it. 
however, i can't seem to find a way how to play it. 
so i have a few questions: first, how do i go to the ps2 in the first place? 
do i access it from tv? is there supposed to be a special channel? 
second, i don't have a cable or tv antenna connected; do i need to have one connected to play the ps2? 
third, i have windows sp1. 
do i really need sp2 to play on the ps2?
