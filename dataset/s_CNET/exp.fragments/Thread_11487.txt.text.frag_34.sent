while firewalls, anti-virus, and spyware tools are essential to protecting the computer, they do not address the topic, nor do they prevent a network breach. 
wireless communication is inherently insecure as evidenced by the articles presented earlier in the topic by several contributors. 
the key issues to understand are: 1.) am i susceptable to an attack? 
if you are using wireless then the answer is unfortunately yes. 
2.) will i suffer from an attack? 
that depends on where the wireless is being used. 
for a typical home network, the prevalent answer is probably not. 
with basic precautions - wpa/psk and mac filtering, the odds are quiet small as the time required to break the key involves days of hacking. 
most of us would be observant enough to notice a strange vehicle or person sitting within 100-200 feet of our house, using a computer, to attempt to hack there way through the authentication process. the hacker would simply look for the ''unsuspecting'' user who isn't using any, or very little, protection. 
also, lets be honest here, the odds of an interception of critical information, at the exact time of transmission, are rather remote. the more important issue is leaving confidential data vulnerable should a network breach occur. 
by instituting strict firewall rules, eliminating shared folders, and encrypting sensitive data (credit card numbers, password files, etc.) you present a profile that the neighborhood hacker will avoid. 
a dedicated hacker will always get through eventually, but the average home user just doesn't have data ''worth'' the time and effort required. 
parking lot attacks on businesses are a much more attractive target for these hackers. 
while security should always be a concern, it should be tempered with common sense.
