i have a xfx 1000w psu and the installation directions say &quot;depending on the type of computer case, correct mounting of the power supply will result with the fan side top cover facing the mainboard. 
this does not apply to all types of cases&quot; my particular case and azza genesis 9000 has the power supply mount on the bottom but at the front of the case. 
there is mesh grill with removable filter on the bottom of the steel chassis and below that a vented tub which is about 2 inches in depth. 
my question is should i have the psu fan facing down toward this grill work or up which will make it facing the hard drive cage which can contain 5 hard drives? 
my assumption is that it should be facing down.
