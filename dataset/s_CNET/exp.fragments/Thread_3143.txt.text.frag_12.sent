sorry but i am so new to this its like reading greek. 
all of my computer knowledge is self taught. 
so this data recovery software is telling me to create a bootdisk or a bootable cdrom to run dispatch. 
so do i need to create a boot cd or my other option is to &quot;extract dispatch from archive and save to root of (optional hdd)&quot; if i just need to extract then i would pick the hdd that i'm trying to recover or my actual internal hdd. 
i hope i'm not being to simple mined here!
