neither apple nor nvidia have confirmed this for us. 
apparently, many nvidia graphics cards are subject to manufacturing defects. 
as such, they could fail after certain periods of use. 
i have heard that the supposedly affected 8400 and 8600 cards actually belong to computers built by dell and hp; apple may not have them. 
no one knows if all of the chips are bad. 
some people say that their nvidia-equipped macbooks are failing, but they are in the minority (so far). 
mine works perfectly, and many others do too. 
if your macbook works fine, i wouldn't be concerned. 
if apple orders a recall, then it should cover all affected notebooks, covered by applecare or not. 
you can only wait and see.
