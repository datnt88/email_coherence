hi. i have a dell xps 410 desktop that came with a 768mb nvidia 8800 gtx. the video card died and i replaced it with an evga gtx 550 ti fpb 1 gb. 
install was very smooth and card works just fine. the 550 ti requires one 6-pin power connector (8800gtx was using 2). it has a mini-hdmi port so an adapter is needed which was not included. 
wasn't sure if it was going to work at all because my power supply is only 375 watt, but after reading that dell underrates its power supplies i decided to give it a try - glad i did. 
performance seems better than with previous card. 
(my system has a quad-core 2.4 ghz cpu, 4gb ram, and a single hard drive.)
