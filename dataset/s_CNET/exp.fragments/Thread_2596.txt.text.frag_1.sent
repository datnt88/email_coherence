i have a 2gb flash drive, vendor unknown, (bought from ebay), 4 computers all running under win xp home, with two desktops and two laptops. the problem: i put two folders, each containing several mp3 files on the flash drive called &quot;medialink&quot; and &quot;mrkeen&quot;. the drive is written using my ibm desktop. 
after writing the files, i read them to see that they are ok. then i eject the flash drive using the ejection software in the system tray, then replug the drive and look again at the two folders. 
now one of them is empty! 
where did the files go? 
how do i retain them? 
it didn't used to work this way. 
how do i determine the cause? 
thanks for any help.
