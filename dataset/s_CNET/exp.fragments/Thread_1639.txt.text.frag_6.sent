ok.. i like that idea. 
what is the best way to accomplish a periodic backup? 
do i just copy the entire hd over to the 'backup hd' once in a while? 
or can you suggest another way? 
also, is there a way to connect directly from hd-to-backup-hd? 
i only have one firewire 800 port and would prefer to avoid transferring files from one hd through firewire to computer then from computer through usb to the backup hd.
