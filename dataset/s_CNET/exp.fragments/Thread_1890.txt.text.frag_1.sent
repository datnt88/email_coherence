i am looking for an inexpensive router that can push output to a barracuda networks appliance. 
i have a cluster of access points that get dhcp from a router/switch. 
traffic then goes through the router to the internet. 
i want to push traffic through a router to the proxy appliance and have had little luck finding routers that list being capable of anything related to proxied internet ports. 
it may be wishful thinking but i don't want to spend the money on a high end router with a good ios, and acls. 
any suggestions would be appreciated.
