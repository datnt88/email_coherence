the first thing i would do is make sure that you are booting from the cd. if you get the ntldr error, you are probably attempting to boot from the drive. 
if you press f2 (usually) during the bios post, you can enter the setup menu and make sure that the cd-rom is the first boot device. 
then when you restart, you should be able to boot from the cd - make sure you watch - there should be a &quot;press any key to boot from cd&quot; message. 
once you get into the xp setup, delete the existing partition and let xp re-format using ntfs, then install xp.
