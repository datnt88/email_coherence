i had the exact problem. 
i also work under xp home edition with a high peed modem. 
i did everything. 
i keep a virus program running, even changing programs from time to time. 
i ever did a full system restore going back 6 months, a point that i knew i had no problems. 
i finally gave up and took it to the shop. 
it ended up that i had multiple viruses despite always keeping a virus scan going. 
i didn't believe the technician when he told me that, but when i re-attached everything, the computer has been running faster and i've had no disconnects since. 
my problem now is that i don't know what virus program to use, because i don't know which one i can believe. 
for me, the $49 visit to the shop was well worth not losing my mind!
