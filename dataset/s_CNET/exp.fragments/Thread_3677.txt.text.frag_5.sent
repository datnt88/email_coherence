the drive reads the disk and it shows on the desktop, but when i try to intstall os x it asks for my admin password. 
when i try and boot from the disk it sounds like it's reading the disk, but the os x login screen always appears. 
i can't understand why it will not boot from a disk because even if i did know my root password it is still not letting me boot from the disk. 
i know the disk works because i installed os x on my home g4 tower from this disk. is there no software available that will delete the hdd? 
after all i'm not trying to access password protected files, i'm just deleting them right??
