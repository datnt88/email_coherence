i have a 2+ year old dell dimension 4600 desktop with a cd/dvd rw drive. 
we hadn't used that drive in a while, and last week it didnt work. 
it has power, but the system can't see the drive. 
i opened up the box and found it wasn't connected to the mother board! 
ok, so i plugged it into its slot. 
still no joy. 
two months ago (in its last week of warrantee), a dell tech replaced the power supply, which had failed. 
perhaps he had unplugged the drive. 
question: why doesn't it work now? 
could the power supply failure have fried the drive? is there some kind of device driver that's missing?
