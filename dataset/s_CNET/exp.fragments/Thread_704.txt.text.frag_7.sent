ah i see. 
i didn't use an optimizer, i ran avg anti-virus and inside this is fix performance 'quick tune component'. 
i analyzed and fixed in avg but honestly can't remember whether i did this as a result of having issues with connecting to internet or beforehand. 
was this the wrong thing to do? 
perhaps you could let me know exactly what information you need? 
i have tried resetting tcp/ip. 
i cannot connect to virgin wireless no matter what i do, even though the computer recognises that it's there and active. 
like i said it doesn't appear to have a problem connecting to public wifi. 
showing different ip / dns addresses. 
just virgin. 
no other laptop / iphone is having an issue connecting to virgin. 
now when i do ipconfig /all it's not showing any of the info it did before. 
just that media state is disconnected. 
no ip or dns addresses
