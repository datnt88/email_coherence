thanks,i have all those drivers up and running. 
i did download the driver from intl for the wireless card, like steve said, and it seem to do the trick. the yellow question mark is gone, replaced by a intel pro wireless adapter. 
it is now able to see my wireless connection and lets me in, but now it can't seem to aquire a ip address. 
do you know what i need to do for this.
