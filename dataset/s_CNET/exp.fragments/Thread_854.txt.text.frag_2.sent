the machine recognizes the hd control panel under the search devices .. but when i go the computer to look for the device it is not there. 
unable to back up my files. 
in the task bar it has the icon to safely remove the hardware. 
i use that before removing the hd. i also checked the drivers and the it indicates that drivers are up to date. 
thank you for your help.
