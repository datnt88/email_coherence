yes, you can use something like dropbox. 
you can also use google documents to share spreadsheets, documents, etc. be sure that you understand all the security issue, though. 
i'm not really up on them, but at my work we use google docs to some extent to share some things. 
it's all accessed via so that's good, but you need to understand the full security picture, like encryption and other ways of limiting access as well.
