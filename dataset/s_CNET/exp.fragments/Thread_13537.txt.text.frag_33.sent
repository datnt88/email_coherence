i read your reply to lee. 
what brand is your external hard drive, and why not two for different types of backups--music, photos, and important files. 
my wife had her money file on my laptop that fried, and while i did a backup of all files and folders, they became corrupt and i lost everything--photos, important files, and music--many that cannot be replaced. 
q1. what software do you use to back up your music to a dvd, and what kind of a dvd burner do you use? 
q2. what is pbase.com? 
many thanks for the reply.
