i don't know of any hard disk that was designed for windows 98. are you wanting to put a hard disk with win 98 installed on the same pc as one with win 7? well, win 7 would be able to see and read from it but you'd probably not be able to run win 98 on the same machine. 
the primary reason is that the amount of ram needed to run win 7 would choke win 98. are we close to answering you here?
