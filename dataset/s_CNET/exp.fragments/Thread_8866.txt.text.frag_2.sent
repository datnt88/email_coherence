make sure the local area network is an exception on all pcs. 
third party firewalls, if you have them, need a similar visit. 
of course you have all of these assigned the same workgroup name and a unique computer name. 
you said xp so i will assume xp pro. 
do you know if you have simple file sharing enabled on some and not others. 
they should be the same. 
i prefer to have it disabled as it gives greater control over permissions. 
set up permissions by individual user or select &quot;everyone&quot; if all will have access. 
make sure that all pcs set up with accounts having the same usernames and passwords. 
make sure, as well, the built in administrator account also has a password. 
i don't think this will solve you ping issue, however. 
that's more likely firewall, hardware or setting issue. the ping attempt should return a reply. 
sometimes the message gives clues as to the problem .
