i leave it to you to use google.com 
to find such. 
also, the person who sold you the cards should offer this support. 
i'd love to note more about this issue, but you haven't followed the forum tip. it reads: &quot;if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; the laptop make/model as well as the models of the cards, the os involved are needed to get a clue. 
some have this issue and it's just the wap's firmware was never updated. 
give google.com and the supplier a try or fill in the information blanks to see if this forum can help.
