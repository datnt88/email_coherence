it was all of what they call 480p which looks horrid on your pc displays. 
the nvidia 6200 line is a typical boost for your machine. 
it's in a reasonable price range so all you need to do is to find which slot is available (agp or pci) and then shop for the card that fits that and has your tv out or hdcp connection.
