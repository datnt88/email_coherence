i have found this the crux of good pc-operation.. then there is the over-burden of &quot;other&quot; hardware.. a 300-gb hdd for a laptop seems a bit...difficult to imagine.. though i think the maxtor brand the best..i use a 120-gb diamond max as an ext.. i have found a hardware solution to less than perfect cpu's.. that in the monitor properties section..to drop hardware accelleration one notch/compensates for a less than perfect cpu.
