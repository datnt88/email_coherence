maybe i should ask what type of ups should i buy.... i looked at my system again to see if a smaller unit would work. 
maybe apc back-ups es usb 750va w/tel & coax 120v could work? 
i have a intel core 2 cpu 6400 2.13ghz desktop with a 26&quot; lcd monitor, cable modem and router, ink jet printer (which i guess should just be on surge protection), and a usb foot pedal (for work). 
os is windows mce if that matters.
