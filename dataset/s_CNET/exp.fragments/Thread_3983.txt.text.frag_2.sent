easy way (assuming you have your pcs set up as a homenetwork)- go to microsoft power toys for xp- download the synctoy- nice little application gives you lots of choices as in echo or combine or whatever you wish - allows you to set up jobs - so you dont need to go through the process each time-just ick a job and let it run.( and its free ) hard way go find a really expensive backup utility with 7 million options you dont want and probably will never need . 
if you dont have a homenetwork then easiest way is to use a burner , export you bookmarks and cookies from ie, find your outlook or outlook express save folder , copy that and everything else you want to a dvd and copy the dvd on to your laptop. 
copy the contents of the e-mail save folder directly into your laptop folder and import the cookies bookmarks into ie using the import export tool in ie and you should be good to go.
