so i have every part other then the video card or card's. 
i put together this assembly - e6600 , p5w dh deluxe, 400 sata2 7200 hdd, dvd burner, card reader, 900 case, raidmax 580 psu, 2 gb corsair ram at 800 mhz dual channel, all in all a good setup. 
but now me and my bro where thinking of 2 x1950 pro's, 200 dollars each. i need a second third opinion, i think it will be alright ?
