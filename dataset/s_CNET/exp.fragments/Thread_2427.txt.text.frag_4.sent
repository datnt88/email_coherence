i have had a wireless router and a logitech wireless keyboard as well as a logitec wireless optical trackball for over a year and have yet to have a single problem... the only thing is when i have my feet on the desk or i have the receiver hidden behind something, i tend to lose connection (about 3-4 feet of clutttered deskspace). 
so i rake everything into the garbage can and then it works like a charm...
