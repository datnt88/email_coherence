flashing the bios was the next item on my list of things to do. 
a couple of things regarding the bios, though. 
i have two options. 
1. i can flash it using the award bios update found here; or 2. my video card (abit x600 pro pci-e) came with an ati utility to flash the bios. 
(looks like you simply put the cd in the tray, select the option to upgrade the bios and that's all there is to it - hopefully!) questions; 1. which of the above two options should i use? 
2. i don't have a floppy. 
can i use a memory stick? 
3. by the way, i've never flashed the bios before. 
i admit, i'm intimidated. 
thanks! 
btw, thank's for the info on the tool that won't work on systems above 1 gb memory. 
sounds like something that may be relevant.
