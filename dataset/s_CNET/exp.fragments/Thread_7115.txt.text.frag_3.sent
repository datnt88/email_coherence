actually the amd system is saying its ip is somthing like 4.227.22x.xxx should i go and assign the ip addresses these machines had before they crashed (i believe the other desktop retains its old ip, it just has a .1 or .2 and so on up to 4) i could just make each computer have the address it would have been given right?
