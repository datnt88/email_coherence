hello, i am totally new to netbooks and have only had my laptop for about 1 year. 
i am not a techinal person when it comes to computers. 
i can't tell you what the difference between a gigabit and a megabit is. 
lol when i have a question i have to get my kids to come and help me! it is sad i know. 
but i am wanting to buy my kids notebooks or netbooks for christmas. 
i have two 15 yr old boys and an 8 yr old girl. 
they will all get their own. 
my question is can they use a netbook with a wireless printer to print school assignments. 
can i block their computer somehow so they don't get on adult websites? 
and last question...i have a internet card for my laptop...will they be able to pickup that signal on their netbooks? 
or will i have to go to a wireless motum? 
they are smart as can be on computers but i do not allow them on my computer, because it is for work not their games. 
thanks for your help!
