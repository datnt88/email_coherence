thank you very much so far. 
i might have a 2 part problem. 
i deleted the reg keys but 1) there was no &quot;upper file&quot; where it said there was supposed to be. 
so i deleted &quot;default&quot; instead because it said &quot;cdrom/dvd drive&quot; next to it. 
upon restarting my disc drive is visible in my computer and everything else seems to work ok so i didn't break anything with the regedit. 
2) new problem though is that i can't burn using my drive. 
it's like the computer knows there's a disc drive but has forgotten that it's able to burn stuff as well. 
any suggestions?
