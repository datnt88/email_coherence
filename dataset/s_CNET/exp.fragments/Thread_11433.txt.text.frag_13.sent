i guess that i have been lucky. 
i try twice to eject, make sure the drive shows the files. 
then simply unplug it. 
for the past 5 years, i have never lost anything. 
my main use is to carry files and programs from my main home office to various places that i work. 
my preference is sandisk 8 gig drives. 
every now and then i 'catch them on sale at office max and i generally get a $10 off on $20 purchase every month or two so they are really inexpensive.
