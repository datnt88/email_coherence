i agree with bob, the best thing is to ask them question before buying to determine who your buying from. 
you can go to cyberpower site and and ask questions. 
a word of caution, i have never bought from these folks, i have heard good things about them and i have heard really bad things about them. 
do some research and check out who ever you buy from.
