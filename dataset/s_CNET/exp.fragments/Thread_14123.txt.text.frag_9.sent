system: microsoft windows xp professional version 2002 service pack 3 when i plug in the usb, the icon appears in the taskbar. 
but its not shown in my computer. 
and if i want to go and change the drive letter, the pc gets stuck and not responding, which i have to restart it then. 
what kind of other information do you want to know? 
and do you recommend me to format the pc?.
