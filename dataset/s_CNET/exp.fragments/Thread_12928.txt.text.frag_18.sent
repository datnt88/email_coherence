far too many pcs are flighty at top speed. 
while i feel this is a warranty issue, if you can't then try: 1. one stick of ram. 
does one of what you have work? 
2. drop the fsb speed from 133 or 266 to 100 or 200 mhz. 
3. bios safest defaults. 
4. the bios must be uptodate. 
this one is snagging too many.
