i have seen faulty drives placed on ebay for such purposes. 
they tend to auction really cheap. 
you will stumble into ebay &quot;stores&quot; that have a lot of used and &quot;as is&quot; computer hardware. 
i never spent money to tinker with hard drives in such a manner, though. 
if you perform the operation, let us know how it goes. 
personally, i go for new drives. 
rebate specials on 250gb and larger drives for $70-$100 are more attractive to me. the warranty is nice, too.
