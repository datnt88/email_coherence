i figured out that the linksys drivers reffered are these : ( ) the eu and au version of the linksys card chipset is made by atheros, like the d-link cards. 
i tried this driver, and, while the card appears as wmp300n - wireless-n pci adapter, it works, but still studders the same way (audio still studders). 
the studdering is making the mouse hard to controll too which is the biggest pain in the ass, cause i gotta photoshop for work.
