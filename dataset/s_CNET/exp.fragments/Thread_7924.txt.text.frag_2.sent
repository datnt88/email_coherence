these are external and portable. 
but, you should not move them while in operation. 
i must suspect lots of failures are due to folks handling the drive and moving it around while it's spinning. 
that being said, if you put together your own, the drive should be as reliable as is you put it in your case. 
my drives are all western digital and seagate models currently. 
my external enclosures are branded bytech or something similar. 
they are basic aluminum with external power supplies and worked right out of the box.
