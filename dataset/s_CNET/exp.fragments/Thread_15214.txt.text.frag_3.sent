thanks skrall a lot!! sorry... i was not very specific... yes i have dsl and i do have a router!!! actually we have 2 computers... and the other one that is connected &quot;with wire (lan cable)&quot; to the router, has no problems at all... mine was connected wireless... and had no problems at all too!! now i disconnected the other pc and i trying to make the laptop work &quot;with wire (lan cable)&quot;. 
(at the beginning i thought it might be the wireless card, even though the computer receives perfect signal!!!) i don-t know.... anyway... i think my isp didn-t give me any software, could that be? the sw i installed was the one of the router... lynksys... thanks again!! please let me know if you thinks is something else!!! ps. why i have virtually adapters??
