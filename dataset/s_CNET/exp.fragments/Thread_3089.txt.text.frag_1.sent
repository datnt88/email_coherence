hi. i just got this new quad core pc and after some research also decided to upgrade the vid card. the card is huge and takes up to slots. the manufacturer recommends a min. 
power supply of 400w but the hp only comes with 300w. 
my question is, do i really need to upgrade the power supply. 
the pc isnt too overloaded with peripherals. 
thanks.
