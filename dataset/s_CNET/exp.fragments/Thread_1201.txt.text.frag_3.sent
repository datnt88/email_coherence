it is a signal that you may have to replace your monitor, blurry screens signal defective flyback or other monitor parts. 
a monitor or crt (if yours is not an lcd type) may get busted after a long term use like light bulbs. 
try using your monitor to some other computers for you to check. 
if the same problem occurs, then spare some money to buy a new monitor. 
if the monitor runs okay with other computers check your video card if you are using one, an on-board video adapter is more difficult to deal with.
