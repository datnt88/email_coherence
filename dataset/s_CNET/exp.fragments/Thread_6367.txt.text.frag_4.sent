i removed 1 of the 2 sticks of ram. then the optical disc would not read the cd. i tried a 2nd optical dvd but the mobo would not see the optical disc in the bios. 
then it died and will not come on. 
i have several pc's to test the parts plus a very good dell that i will use a new hd and the xp install disc on a test install. 
i will let you know how it worked out. 
thanks for the quick response. 
enjoy the rest of your cajun gumbo
