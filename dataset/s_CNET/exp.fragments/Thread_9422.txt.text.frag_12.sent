yeah. i wondered about that. 
i can't figure out how it's disabled or how to turn it on. 
there's no simple &quot;on&quot; button. 
that link is to my zipped microsoft word document containing all the screen shots from every tab and option. 
please review it and let me know what i missed. 
thanks guys!
