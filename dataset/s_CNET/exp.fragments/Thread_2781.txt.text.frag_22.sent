think first about your budget and what you want your new pc to do. 
buying a new pc will be easier and more cost effective in the short run, especially if you don't do much besides word processing, internet and older games, but you may still have a machine that's behind the times. 
if you want to have a pc that's mostly state-of-the-art (except for what you're migrating in) build it. 
it is not tremendously difficult and is quite a lot of fun. 
i've built my own pc that i use daily for video editing as well as pc's for others from pieces i've cannibalized from other pc's. 
you probably won't save a lot of money but you will know each and every piece of equipment, which is a lot more than you can say for an off the shelf pc. there are lots of resources, both on the web and in print, on building. 
pcworld has articles on building (that will be $49.95 please) and also check extremetech.com, as they have many project pc's with cost estimates and build lists.
