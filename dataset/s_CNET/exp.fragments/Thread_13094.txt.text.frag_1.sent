hi i want to install an agp video card into my pc but i have a problem. 
i do not have the manual for the motherboard and i cannot figure out which keys to press to enter the bios. 
i searched google and found many different combinations but none seem to work. 
i need to get into the bios to disable the on board video and enable agp. is there anyway i can track down my bios key? 
also is there another way to disable on board video without using the bios? 
anyway my bios is amibios ver 7 and the numbers at the bottom of the screen are &quot;amibios-0aawvp06-y2kc-f&quot; thanks
