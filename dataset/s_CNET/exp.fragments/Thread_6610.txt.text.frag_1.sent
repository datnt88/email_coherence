i purchased a western digital esata external drive and hooked it up to my macbook pro using a siig esata-to-express34 controller. 
i formatted the drive using disk utility. 
i find that i can read from the drive fine. 
but whenever i try to save any large files into the drive, it stops copying after a while. the drive has a usb interface as well, and i can read/write from the drive just fine using the usb. 
but writes fail whenever i use the e-sata interface. 
what can be the problem?
