the nvidia card has 6 holes and the emachine has two 4 holes and another large plug w/ at least a dozen. 
all are attached to the motherboard (a 4 is by itself and the other two are paired together in one big slot) the nvidia also came with an adapter to fit its 6 holes and the adapter splits into two, each one having three large prongs at the end, instead of holes.
