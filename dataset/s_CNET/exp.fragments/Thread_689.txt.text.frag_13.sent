we just purchased a canon mp530 and my wife really likes it a lot.she does scrapbooking.you 
stated that you use the refill kits with the chip.was 
there any particular brand that you use more than any others? the information would be of a big help and savings on ink would be incredable. 
i have seen where there are automatic refill systems for the epson 9400 printer.do 
you know of any automatic refill systems for the canon mp530?. thanks for your time.
