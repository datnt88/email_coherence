got a general question on hd backups and viruses. 
i have couple problems: 1) belarc advisor has flagged my old 30gb hd as &quot;failure&quot; (although it still works for now) 2) the old p3 machine where this hd resides is plauged with a bad malware virus (about:blank / oneclicksearches.com 
/ psguard). 
i've tried cleaning the machine of this horrible virus with multiple apps, but no luck yet. 
fortunately i'm buying a new pc this weekend so i'm ready to get my critical files (digital photos & ms docs) off the old machine and just scrap the beast. 
i got cd software backups for all my apps on the old pc, so i litterally only want to transfer photos & ms docs to the new machine. 
because my hd is on the brink of failure, backing up my critical photos & docs is the primary concern. 
ideally, i'd just network my old machine and new machine and conduct file transfers. 
however i'm afraid by doing so i'll risk transferring viruses & malware to the new machine. 
i could just burn backup cd's or buy & use an external usb hd to backup my photos & docs, but again i'm not sure if some of these viruses & adwares will 'stow away' on the cd's or ext. 
hd, and eventually infect my brand new machine. 
any advice would be appreciated!!
