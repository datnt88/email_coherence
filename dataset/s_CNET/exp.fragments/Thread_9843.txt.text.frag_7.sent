i have very aware if the gnerous full year warranty. 
companies usually provide 3 months or a little more. 
i first had this problem in late november. 
i sent it to cisnet repairs and got it back in late decmeber and now have the same problem again in early february. 
i think i must be doing something wrong if the same exact problem happened again. 
i never touched the inside of the pc until sunday and i saw no damage in the pc. i had the pc run through a ups and that didn't stop anything. 
i am going to perform a bee test if i hear anything.
