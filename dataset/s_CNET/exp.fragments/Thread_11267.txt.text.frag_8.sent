i would be most interested in hearing what you recommend to handle an i7 975, nothing extreme on the oc front, 6 gb corsair ddr3 1600, 2 gtx 295's sli and will fit in an antec 902? 
money isn't an issue, but obviously i don't want to blow money on a board that is just as good as a cheaper one but has features i probably won't need (3rd sli slot etc).
