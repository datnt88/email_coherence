damn that big??? well i'm looking for more of gaming and watching dvd's and what not. 
games like counter strike. 
i'm looking for a good lcd that wont have ghosting and hopefully dead pixels which sucks if i get a couple of those. 
i dunno really, but i'm looking for 19 or maybe a little bigger than that. 
but a 32inch lcd?? probably to big. 
but how good is it for gaming?
