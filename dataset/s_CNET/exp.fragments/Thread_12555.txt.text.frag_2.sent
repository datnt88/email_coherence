any agp based video card out there if new is going to be better than what you have now. 
that's good news provided as you already know can find one. 
thus, it will be an upgraded version quite capable. 
start at these vendors, and google others. 
you can use the web search engines under google, etc. by narrowing it down via the price searchers, like newtag and shopzilla, etc.. of course, there is ebay, just be sure to check their reviews or credentials.
