this post has been my findings over the past 12 years. 
my needs are moderate, the most intense games we have are barnyard and need for speed which are now playing nicely on a 2 year old sempron that i added a 256 graphic card and 512 more ram to, the original cost of the machine w/monitor was $299, i still have the monitor in the box as lcd is preferred. 
it used to be i had to shop around for a computer that was upgradable, now it is more of a given, i never really found the need to have the most quality part in the machine, altho i have replaced a few power boxes i have only replaced one motherboard that got toasted by a failing power box. 
a low end compaq laptop i just purchased with 512 or ram in it stated right on the box 1 dimm, knowing that before i left the store with vista on it i was going to at least need another dimm for that other slot to be able to run even vista let alone any of my programs too. 
i have found emachines over these years to allow for the most growing out of the box, hp middle of the road, compaq and finally packard bell the least, now it seems most all i have seen allow for at least 2gig ram - with 4 being the preferred and a pci express slot for the video upgrade. 
i have less experience with dell or gateway as i have only had one gateway, the one i have now and no dell's altho i have people who do have dell's, one needed service 3 times in the first year the other none in 3 years now. 
i buy, sell, trade computers for family and friends of all very modest needs so deal mainly with all low end computers, the part i have replaced the most in all these computers is the modem since they liked to keep them hooked up during storms and that is the first thing lightening looks for and ram has always been installed. 
i think the evolution in these 12 years is - in the beginning people were less likely to take the screws off the back of a pc case, now it's something that is done all the time so making the computer more upgradable is more practical.
