hello all, i could really use a computer, but i don't know if i should wait until x-mas sales. 
i would really like an hp high performance computer. 
should i wait for prices to tumble so i could get a quad core, or should i just get a dual core, probably amd now? 
i'll probably try and get 3gb ram, 500gb hdd, tv tuner, wireless, maybe a 19&quot; widescreen. 
i want to render images, use cad, and do other engineering related items. 
any thoughts?? thanks
