will the computer connected to the vpn not be able to see the lan, or the computers on the lan not be able to see the lan, or both? 
i have been able to connect a computer to the vpn, atleast so i assume, the display for a dialup connection on windows 98 went through the process of dialing, connecting, registering, and authenticating and the host computer had one user connected to it through the incoming connections wizard. 
maybe it is just that i dont know where to look to access the files over a virtual network connection. 
as i stated earlier this is my first experience in setting up a vpn and networking multiple computers together through a router, so i'm fairly incompetent at the moment, through all my searching all il found were instructions on setting up a incomming connection on win xp, and lots of different ways to make a computer that could connect to a vpn. 
so beyond that i dont know what i am doing. 
any help is appriciated, and thanks for the help so far.
