i believe both the razer barracuda headset, and sound blaster fatal1ty pro are mono, it seems to fit in perfectly as well. 
also, it worked for the longest time, about 2-3 years, and 2 months after i bought the new computer (still using the same sound card and headset). 
this is the oddest problem i've seen
