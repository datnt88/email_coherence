if i remember right, i've always done dban on 1-hd installed in the system. 
disconnect all others and if this is the actual 2nd hd, make solo as if only on port 1, etc.. doing so, helps defeat the error popping-up but i urge trying this before trying anything else. 
plus, the error probably is more of a procedural one than a h/w fault.
