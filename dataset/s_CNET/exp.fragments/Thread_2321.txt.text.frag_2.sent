but as a test to see if it's your network, try it at a hotspot out at starbucks, macdonalds, panero bread, etc. this will tell you if it's the network or the laptop. 
i'd like to discuss this but i have to use networking terms such as wpa2, settings and more. 
it's best if you tell what those settings are.
