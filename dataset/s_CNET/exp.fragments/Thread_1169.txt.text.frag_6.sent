&quot;&quot;pc wont come on light on the front does but then nothing, have changed the psu aswell and still nothing dont even hear the fan starting &quot;&quot; what light comes on?? the power led?? if so that means that you have 5 volts at least. 
are symptoms before changing psu identical or did some of them change??? what fan is it that you don't hear starting?? was the second psu a new unit of same or higher wattage, or an old one that you had laying around?? do you know how to turn the psu by itself?
