the dsl is from verizon via the telephone... the satellite receiver has caller id built into it so you can know who is calling by the id showing up on the tv screen. 
the wifi was in use from the beginning when i first got it back in august because the dsl modem had wifi built into it and the ibook had airport card from the factory. the erroneous caller id with no number or ring through that displays on the satellite caller id (but not on the phone's handset) only started after the pc was hooked up to the wifi network. 
i have yet to talk with verizon or directv so i can't give much more input yet. 
i just thought it interesting that the display only started after the pc was in the network... big brother in the house? 
will update as soon as i have anything.
