it's not something one would teach or learn in a forum setting for many reasons. 
one is that there is the web. 
&quot;that app&quot; is one that tackles the issues that explorer exposes. 
using the command line is preferred by me since it solves it without having to install another app. 
besides how would i do this on other machines? 
as to the drive being buggy. 
if false then it's the usual windows is too busy to respond to you. 
if true then you have a warranty issue and ask the makers of machine, os and drives to fix it. 
my bet is the usual &quot;windows explorer is too busy issue.&quot; 
a parting thought is to check the hard drive maker's web page on the drive and see if they issued new firmware. 
it's pretty rare but does happen that a drive needs updated firmware. 
yes, it happened to me.
