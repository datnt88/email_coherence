you need to look at what you are sending up to the internet before you decide on a google docs, dorpbox, teamdrive or any other public &quot;cloud&quot; service. 
if this is your business, what would happen to you if you found your document on the front page of a newspaper (l.a. times, wall st. journal) or on t.v. or your reuters newsfeed. 
first, of all, i hope you are not sharing medical data. 
by putting medical data up on any of these services without you personally encrypting the file, you would be in violation of hipaa and hitech laws as none of these services are hipp-compliant. 
google says that some put this data on google docs but google does not have any responsibility for protecting your data and is not really hipaa-compliant. 
i work at a county government. 
hipaa violations (not breaches) usually carry about a $1 million fine. 
so, if you are a doctor, lawyer or are looking to share customer data confidentially, i would at least read the terms of service for any of these internets sites. 
they not only don't guarantee that your stuff is safe, but they actuall claim rights that are opposite of that. 
convenient, yes, confidential, no.
