i can't seem to find prices on the hp media center m1297 system. 
it is new from hp february 2005. the gateway is priced at $1199 w/o monotor. 
there is a difference in the two which may make a price difference. 
if the price is not out of line i personally would select the hp as it has the pent 4 640 (p) ht 3.2ghz with the new 64-bit support (em64t) with 2mb l2 cache and 300 gb 7200rpm hard drive. 
the gateway has the pent 4 550 ht with a slightly larger 3.4ghz, little less 1mb l2 cache and 250 gb 7200 rpm hard drive. 
the 5xx series do not have the 64-bit support. 
dell also has a selection of computers with the media center system.
