if you're running xp, the system os sees that too much has changed or it appears so, thus the os will not run/boot. 
you need to re-install the os, but that invalidates the os as it was supplied, read the eula. 
you need a retail version of the os, as the oem version won't allow to install or be 100%. 
google away but the answer lies as i explained it, any other solution is outside your eula provided.
