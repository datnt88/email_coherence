i would like to wirelessly bridge 2 or 3 wired switches/hubs, plus have normal wireless access. 
(new house, and i don't want to snake wires between floors.) i have a large collection of hubs, wired and wireless routers and a wireless access points, but no &quot;bridge&quot; (they are never on sale). 
can i get this project done with what i have? 
and if so, how? 
will i have to utilize more than one channel? 
different network names? 
help!
