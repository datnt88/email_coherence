what you say makes much sense. 
i may just have a nexxtech lemon here (not meant to disparage this company). 
the front usb's work for other peripherals e.g. b/u drive. 
i prefer an ac powered hub to cover any power hungry devices in the future. 
i am still perplexed that other than preventing booting to win 7, it works normally. 
as an aside, the green sound output jack on the rear panel has suddenly stopped functioning. 
in fact, have speakers connected to a front jack. 
another reason to get the old dell 5150 functioning as a backup computer. 
i am now starting a special savings account for the purchase of my next new desktop, as it seems this pavilion may be entering the croak phase. 
thanx again for your input.
