it will, to an extent. 
you won't get 4 gigs though. 
the system resources are why. 
pci memory addressing will take up a portion of what the 4 gigs will use leaving much ram with only around 3.4 or less, depending in actual use. 
so in theory, yah, in actuality, no. vista starter is only like, 1 gig i believe but don't quote me, the rest on 32 bit should support it.
