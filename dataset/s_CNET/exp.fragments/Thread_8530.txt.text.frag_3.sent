you can afford an imac. 
they start at $1200 for the 20&quot; model. 
if you want to build your own, i suggest a barebones since it will already have the case, power supply, and motherboard premounted. 
adding the cpu, ram, and drives will only take you about 30 minutes. 
you didn't mention any specific apps, but the type of work you plan to do could use a lot of memory, so i suggest you get 4gb. 
barebones: shuttle cube, $235 or asus slimline, $200 dual core cpu: intel core2duo e6750 (2.66ghz ), $190 4gb ram: mushkin ddr2-800, $90 500gb hard drive: western digital caviar gp sata, $105 dvd burner: lg 20x w/lightscribe, $31 wireless keyboard/mouse: microsoft laser combo, $46 os: windows vista premuium, $110 total: $807 or $772 depending on barebones if you want dual monitors, you'll need to add a video card like this: pny 8400gs low profile, $66 if you're planning on something like an m-audio delta card , you'll need to use a cube (or full-size) case. 
if you're going to be using usb or firewire audio , the slimline is fine.
