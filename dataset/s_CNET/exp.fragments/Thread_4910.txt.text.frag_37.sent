gateway pays for shipping. 
i have already sent this turd in once. 
they send you a box with a pre-paid freight sticker on it. 
so nice of them to do that for us! i got my new box friday. the problem has for the most part gone away (knocking on wood). 
i'm wondering if i should send it in or just wait for it to get worse.
