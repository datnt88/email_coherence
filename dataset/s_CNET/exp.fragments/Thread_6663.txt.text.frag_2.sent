i'd start with a new motherboard with new ram memory and a new cpu. 
then you might need a new os (because seeing the cpu i doubt if it's recent enough to have xp) and a new harddisk (because this new os uses much more disk space). 
and you might need a new videocard if your old one can't be used on the new motherboard. 
given the average lifetime of cd-drives it makes sense to replace that also. 
if you've got some money left, make it a dvd-burner. 
taken all together, your best bet is a new pc.
