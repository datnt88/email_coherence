and ask if they will upgrade your replacement to a refurb business notebook that has the pcmcia slot. 
you may have to pay for the upgrade. 
in any case it looks like you can't avoid additional expense and that's disgraceful for all the vendors in your situation. 
re technology going too fast...it's certainly not well planned for consumer products and every competitor is rushing to grab the money as long as consumers are anxious to part with it. 
next time if you need technology stability, look for the business products that have longer lifecycles. 
costs more but you can expect longer usability than the consumer cousins.
