great info zooyorker6! 
although, now i'm kind of freaked me out that the athlon was so low on the grading scale! 
i don't understand though because the intel core 2 quad processor q6600 operates at 2.4ghz, where as the amd athlon64 x2 6000+ (dual core) operates at 3.0ghz is that report saying that a 2.4ghz can actually perform better than the 3.0ghz athlon? 
do you think the heating issue could cause the same issues i'm having with my laptop where it shuts down. 
i wonder if i could upgrade the fan if that happens.... also, do you think i would really notice the difference between the process while using the computers! 
thanks!
