they are coming way down in price. 
i just got a 4 gb usb stick for $20! check around for some deals, you may find something better that i did. the biggest ones i've heard of so far are 8 gb, but there could be bigger ones out there. 
now with the sandisk 1gb player you may be able to get the data from point a to point b using that. 
i will say though the memory stick is easier. 
plug and play really.
