hi. 1. it seems any 24 port un-managed gigabit switch will meet your requirements. 
2. i have had some consistent bad experiences with d-link devices. 
some of their ports randomly stop functioning after a while. 
3. i would suggest netgear or tp-link as an option. 
4. for poe, you are right on spot. 
use external power injectors. 
however use a cheap multimeter to check voltage drop on the network cable - then purchase a higher rated power adapter after calculating the power drop. 
i can provide you with step by step instructions to calculate it if you want. 5. netgear on ebay.uk for gbp 118 6. tp-link on ebay.in - for approx $120 - note the model number. 
in uk it costs a bit more in gbp. 
take care, navneet.
