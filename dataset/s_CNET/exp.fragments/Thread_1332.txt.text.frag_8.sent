i got home from work tonight and the wife tells me of her adventures loading drivers onto the new hdd. 
then she mentions the new drive is now f:/ and she had to change things when they wanted to go to the c:/ drive. 
now how am i going to straighten this mess out? 
good lord, what next? 
what do i have to do to format this drive and install it so it is recognized as the c:/ drive? 
we had gotten as far as loading windows xp sp2, the wireless adapter for the internet, and some drivesrs. 
i have now reconnected the old hdd so she can use the computer until we get sorted out. 
boy is this a pita. 
please, help!
