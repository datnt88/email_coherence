it's sometimes hard for me to understand why the steps are not followed. 
either someone flips it back and forth then oks it (that was not the procedure) or they were rebooting at each step (again, not in the procedure.) it's in the noted web link so if you are unsure you followed the steps, just read it one more time and do the steps exactly as written. 
next up? 
1. drivers. 
2. no spyware. 
3. scan the machine with housecall.
