much about the setup of the router. 
is it set per our forum sticky at there are some that will not update the router firmware because it works with other machines. 
sadly i have over a dozen personal instances of that and the owner paid the 120 bucks for the tech to come out and update the firmware they could have done themselves. 
yes, go ahead and ask why it fixes it. 
sorry, i don't know the answer or rather i do but it's too much for me to type in this small space.
