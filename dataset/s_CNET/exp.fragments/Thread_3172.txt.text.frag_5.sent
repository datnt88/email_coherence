&quot;i disabled the ssid broadcast once again and as soon as i did the thinkpad lost all connectivity to the network. 
for some reason, it would communicate with the network only when ssid broadcasting was enabled. 
i suggest you try this and see what happens.&quot; i know what you are saying but here's what i'll telling you. 
not everything works as we wish it would.
