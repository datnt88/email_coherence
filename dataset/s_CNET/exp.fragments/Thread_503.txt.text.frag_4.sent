in fact, it turns out that i added xp that way. 
in vista when i go to add drivers i get to choose by *processor*, not os. that's why i did not remember doing this. the choices are: itanium, x64, x86. 
i'm beginning to feel non-supported by vista! 
still, i oughtta be able to *find* the shared printer. 
i'm gonna go look for it again. 
thanks scottwang!
