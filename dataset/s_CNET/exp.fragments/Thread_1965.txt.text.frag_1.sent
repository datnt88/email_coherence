hi, yestreday, i used pc and connected my wd 500g hdd. 
i am stupid, i know. 
anyways, when i used them, the usb- the side of hdd, not pc, was removed accidentally. 
i reconnected it soon, but it was not respond at all. 
i tried to use other computers, both pc, and mac, but some said it is not respond, or said &quot;searching preconfigured driver folders&quot; forever. 
now i do not have my own laptop, because it also has probelem and i sent it to be fixed. 
i have bunch of important stuffs in this hdd, do you know how to resolve this issue in stead of endanger the memories? 
my hdd's light is on when i connect to pc. my hdd has kinda weird sound when i connect, but its gonna be stooped in seconds. 
my hdd cannot show up in &quot;my computers&quot;. 
please help me!!
