thanks for the replies. 
it was an internal drive i was looking for. the reason i asked was i seem to remember that the laptop or os needed a piece of built in software to enable you to play discs a bit like dvd software but hardcoded in. 
i was looking at this drive: it seems cheap enough and does what i want
