i have the same problem, the this is i think my ps2 port is not working so i got myself a converter to plug it to the ubs port instead, and now im have the problem as described on 1st post.. so is there a way i can get into bios ? 
i have 2 extra harddisk (sata as the main and 2 more ide)and would like to set boot priorities tru bios.. as occasionally, prior to the keyboard problem it does not detect the sata drive as the master.. and help would much be appreciated, thanks!
