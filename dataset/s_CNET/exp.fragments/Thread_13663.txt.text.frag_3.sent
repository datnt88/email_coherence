quality matters and thus any decent namebrand will stand behind thier product. 
while generic brands do deliver but there is less desirable products offered and there's no way to tell the difference until failure. 
you can buy with confidence any namebrand product overall. 
my experience with generic brands is pretty much ok, but those that failed i had no one to turn to for warranty replacement and/or recourse since they failed long after some period that any store would stand behind them plus no &quot;sales receipt&quot; by that time, figures.
