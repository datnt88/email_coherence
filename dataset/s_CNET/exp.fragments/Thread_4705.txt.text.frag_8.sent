&lt;lol&gt; that was even more confusing. 
to clarify maybe ... a &quot;memory module&quot; is a complete memory assembly. 
it could be a dimm, a simm, an sodimm (small outline dimm used in notebooks, and so on. 
a dimm is a type of memory module. the terms are used interchangeably as a dimm is a memory module. 
ddr is a type of memory and can be on a dimm or sodimm.
