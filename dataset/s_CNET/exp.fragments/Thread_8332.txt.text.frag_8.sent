regarding externals being more vulnerable to attacks [viruses, spyware, etc.], i have no idea what the concern is here: as long as your antivirus and other protection software is configured to actively scan all drives, there is no concern whatsoever. 
i run avg antivirus plus firewall, adaware se plus, spybot search & destroy, and pest patrol. 
all of them scan and protect all of my drives because i configured them that way--if you monitor a scan in any of these programs you will see the program access these drives and they will all alert you if something nasty is present.
