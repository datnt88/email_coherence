i was actually referring to the ram you linked me, but i still like the one's i linked, unless you need a lower price? 
oh, yeah. 
newegg has a fantastic rma program. 
i'd much rather deal with newegg than a company. 
i looked through the case choices again and i really like the azza. the others are too expensive, imo, for what you get, but i'm not one to talk with a $220 case. 
but the azza looks like it has the good stuff: removable mobo tray, good fans, nice exterior design. 
it isn't tool-less, but i find the trusting reassurance of a tightened screw a bit more satisfying than the promise of wimpy plastic.
