i have to admit, i didn't pay a lot of attention to the nexus 7 because of google's bias towards online use (which may be part of why the n7 doesn't have a microsd slot). 
if it supports usb otg though - and i've confirmed it does - that works for me. 
sadly, no new n7 was announced at google i/o this year. 
doesn't mean there isn't one coming, but it won't be this summer. 
i'll have to go put hands on one before i decide - but it seems promising. 
thanks!
