i'm definitely very careful about handling these things. 
this is my 2nd ext. 
hd. from what i was able to see/try on this new one, i can't see where in the wd screen that i can do any folder creation or dragging. 
i'll have another look. 
you familiar with these particular models? 
('cause the official wd forum is slow as molasses)
