recently switching from a pc to mac, i'm still knew to the computer. 
i switched because i thought i wouldnt have to worry bout the mac running slow due to excess software such as virus protection. 
my macbook takes a very long time to load all internet pages. 
i know my connection is fine because my old computer, which is about 6 years old, runs super quick on the internet. 
is there something i dont know. 
are there any certain settings i should be looking at? 
i feel like i should save some money and just get dial-up!!!!! i do have a cable internet connection. 
its wired in, not wireless, if that makes a difference. 
thanks in advance
