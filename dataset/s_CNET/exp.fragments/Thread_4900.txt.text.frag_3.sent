i posted this to find out if their were any products people would recommend, obviously cisco would say that the 11501 switch is the obvious route. 
a co-worker and myself have come up w/ a product that will do the job, turns out we've decided not to go w/ cisco. 
i really appreciate the time and effort that you put into your exstensive and highly detailed reponse bob. 
seems to me it was delivered in a mocking manner. 
i was on the phone w/ nortel and cisco yesterday for about an hour a piece.
