i've watched half of my new &quot;willy wonka and the chocolate factory&quot; on my home computer, which sports a pioneer bdc-202 blu-ray player. 
now, however, i can read and write other disks, but the 202 has stopped recognizing blu-ray disks altogether! the only updates i've made are microsoft's -- updates i've grown increasingly wary of -- and i'm wondering if it could be the updates that are creating this problem! 
not only will my powerdvd 8 not see it, neither can i get my system to see any content. 
indeed, it thinks there is no disk there. 
does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening? 
i can't believe it's a hardware problem, but who knows? 
thanks!
