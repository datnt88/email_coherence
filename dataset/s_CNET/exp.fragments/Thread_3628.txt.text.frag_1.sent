hi i have the following configuration gigabyte ex58 ud3r mobo core i7 920 running at 2.66 ghz radeon hd 4670 vengeance? 
- 4gb single module ddr3 memory kit extreme power plus 600w zebronics joy cabinet ( ) other then that i don't have any coolant as such. 
my easytune 6 normally reads as below avg. 
system temperature: 45cavg. 
cpu temperature: 60c i normally use it for running virtual machine or vmware server. 
today twice my system got restarted due to excessive load/heat. 
easytune 6 reading slightly went above the normal. 
i would like to know what is the standard reading for this configuration. 
also i am going to buy another vengeance? 
- 4gb single module ddr3 memory kit soon. 
please advise to overcome this heat problem considering i will be overclocking and upgrading more ram in future.
