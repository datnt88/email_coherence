but it all depends, if you are diy a compatible computer then change the core to machine one and all will be fine. 
but on the other hand if you are buying from a company than machine 2 is the way to go, you will keep the processor for a longer time than the i7 and the 1tb hardrive will last much longer. 
and the graphics card on machine two is a bit better than on machine 1. but you did not give us any prices so its hard to tell. 
might want to extend on that. 
good luck &lt;&lt;&lt;nick&gt;&gt;&gt;
