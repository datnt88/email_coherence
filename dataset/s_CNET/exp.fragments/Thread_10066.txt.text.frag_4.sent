weather you bought the cd on line or in the store, i'm sure their web page help will gladly help you out. 
i've bought things on line and lost or misplaced my code or password. 
if they have your name on file they will give you a code or new password...buying on line helps you because they send you an e-mail, usually with your user name and password, so any time you have to re-install they will send you to a site to re-install....good luck
