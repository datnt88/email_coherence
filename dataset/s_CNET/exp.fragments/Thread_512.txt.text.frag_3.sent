but lets take a real bill and find a number to use. 
using the total bill divided by the number of kwh i arrive at 15.68 cents per kwh. 1 year = 8,760 hours 30 watts for 1 year = 262.8 
kwh or 41.21 bucks. 
you decide here. 
but your usual gamer desktops idles at 200 watts so let's do that. 
about 275 a year.
