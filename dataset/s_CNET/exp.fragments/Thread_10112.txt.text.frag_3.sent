unfortunately, the asus doesn't have usb ports, which i definitely want, b/c i need usb for mobile broadband. 
so, it's out. 
i ended up buying a &quot;superpad&quot; on amazon for $199, more as an experiment as anything. 
it got mixed reviews, but i thought, what the heck :-)can always send it back. 
thx j
