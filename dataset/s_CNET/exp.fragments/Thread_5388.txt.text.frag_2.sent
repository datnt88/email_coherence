if you have no time to even store the &quot;important data&quot; what good is trying to store the system. 
basically, if storage fails for some reason, then data is gone. 
always think data first, then the h/w.. i suggest you wrap in orginal packing if available. 
if not, then a simple double bagging in plastic bags will do fine then store in closet. 
if you have access to descentant, use some. 
all this depends on the condition/enviroment of area of storage.
