my cd-dvd hardware is not recognized but the drivers are there and updated. 
there is an exclamation point beside the drives. 
i saw what i hoped to be an answer in the old forum to my problem. 
i looked at the suggested registry fix on my registry, but there is no lower filter to remove, only an upper filter so i haven't tried it. 
i have an intel pentium 4 processor 4 with 2 gb ram. 
itunes and oneclick dvd copy are not working together after an xp 2002 sp3 reinstall (it was stuck in a loop) and upgrade from office 2007 to office 2010. 
before the reinstall, i did not have a problem with this issue, although there were other issues associated to photo software and my hp printer software. 
i now have a canon mx300 printer. 
itunes says to reinstall itunes because the registry settings that use the itunes drivers are missing. 
even if i uninstall the one click or the drives and restart, it doesn't work. 
it was fine until the oneclick updated and a microsoft update failed, and then poof! 
no drives, just the exclamation points. 
i tried using registry mechanic 10 to no avail. 
i've tried microsoft mr. fixit-ms mat-fix, and i receive a 0x80092003 runtime error that is 'elevated'. 
ms troubleshooter gives a code 41 error. 
the computer is a little older; i have nec dvd-rw drive and liteon combo sohc 5036v drive. 
have no idea what to do... help?! thanx
