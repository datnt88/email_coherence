i use a thinkpad z60m. 
it's on every day for at least 9 hours, and works beautifully. 
hard drive died last year, which surprised me (thinkpads are normally synonymous with quality) but was actually a blessing in disguise. 
i put in a new 100 gb hd and installed ubuntu. 
ubuntu takes advantage of all the fun stuff this thinkpad can do, so in no way do i miss windows. 
this machine, with a 2ghz processor and 1.2gb ram, has exceeded my expectations in every way. 
talk about a workhorse.
