you give us no idea how old the system is that you put the hard drive in. 
many older systems can't recognize large drives, and a 40gb may be unusable in a pii system without a bios upgrade (or even with one). 
if the system is real new then you may need to jumper the drive as cs (cable select) not master or alone (if alone on the cable that is a separate setting and you don't use master). 
do not change the jumper for the number of heads, if you do that you will lose all data that was on there before.
