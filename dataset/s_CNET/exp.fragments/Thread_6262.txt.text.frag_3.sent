thanks for the response. 
it seems that the smps was faulty. 
i concluded this from the fact that the clicking sata hdd worked perfectly when attached to another smps. 
anyways, i'm not relying on the hdd and a backup is in progress. 
apart from this, i had attached another pata hdd to the faulty smps to check and after being detected, it stopped spinning after 5 seconds and has now completely stopped functioning even with another smps. the &quot;smooth&quot; chip is getting overheated in this hdd and the motor seems lifeless. 
i guess i blew the smooth chip and am now stuck with a bricked hdd
