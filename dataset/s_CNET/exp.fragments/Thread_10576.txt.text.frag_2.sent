if you drive a copy of a file down to one copy then there is no backup. 
two copies is barely a backup since one loss and you fall into a state of no backup. 
this is all very old it rules and lore but worth going over again and again until we feel like it's good enough. 
many folk have no backup at all. 
there are dozens of backup softwares out there. 
i continue to use syncback and goodsync. 
now a little use of dropbox as well.
