first, i re-mounted the 55+ hdd (which is actually a 60gb according to the info on the hdd's label, so i'll call it that. 
, back into the mini-external case, then, i put the 160hdd back in my laptop. 
turned both on. 
(of course lol!) then, i went to computer management, found it and compared partitions with what i have already running (the 160hdd) to the 60hdd (in the ext. 
case). 
apparently, and i'm betting this is the answer, the 60hdd's &quot;healthy&quot; partition of 55.83 gigs needs to be &quot;marked as &quot;active&quot;. 
i found this out by right-clicking the larger healthy partition, and &quot;mark as active&quot; was in bold. 
on the 160gb hdd inside my laptop, the healthy partition's &quot;mark as active&quot; isn't clickable idicating that it is already active. 
- by the way lacsr?, i did indeed attempt to boot other cd-roms to that drive (when it was in the laptop of course and yes as well, with the new 160dd in my laptop, everything shows/boots nicely. 
you'd mentioned that it is possible taht it may no longer accept a bootable disk...as i'd writen in my original post, i think i may have deleted and/or formatted over the boot portion of the 60gb hdd. 
(see next paragraph for more upcoming info)... thank you so much for your suggestions. 
i appreciate your assistace! - now, back to the issue @ hand. 
i think i'll &quot;mark as active&quot; the 60gb hdd while i still have it inside the ext. 
case... h-o-p-e-f-u-l-l-y it will then enable me boot to it and even install a different o.s. to it (i.e., windows xp pro, or a linux o.s.) - thanks again to all who have assisted me, or may even have any further comments/ questions to this post. 
- later, tony
