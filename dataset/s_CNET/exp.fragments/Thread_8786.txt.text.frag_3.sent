its very important to check the specs of your laptop to understand the what it supports. 
i can only suggest as you have 4gb already it may not support more or you have to remove some ram in order to re-use the now empty slot(s) to populate with larger ram sticks. 
otherwise, its a mute point. 
alas, when it comes to brand it always nice to have the same type and/or brand installed. 
it may not matter but it can if the system is too picky. 
as already suggested to you, crucial is a good place to review and kingston is also one. the vaule of either one is the replacement or if there is an issue you can return them minus any s/h costs. 
review the warranty and what it entails. 
i have found these website good sources due to cost and/or sales at times. 
its all up to you and i find it best review again what policies they have in order to understand they maybe.
