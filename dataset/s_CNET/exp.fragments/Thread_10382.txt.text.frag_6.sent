so vista will add a new twist. 
sorry but don't know vista myself but this shouldn't be too difficult. 
the first thing i would do is run this by your college help desk folks. 
it should be their job to control network traffic on that system. 
secondly, you need to set up permissions anyway. 
just don't set them up to allow everyone full access. 
use defined users that require a password for access. 
it's also possible to set up different user profiles for the home and away. 
while you cannot eliminate hacking attempts, you can make it not worth the effort.
