i am connecting my laptop pc to my hdtv via a wireless gizmo. the gizmo has a dongle transmitter connected to the pc via the hdmi port and the usb port for power, on the receiver hdtv end the receiver box connects to the hdtv through the hdtv hdmi port and to the a/c power on the wall, all this is to replace a hdmi to hdmi cable connection. 
i hope i,m clear so far. 
now i want to clone my pc screen to my hdtv screen i.e. i want to see the exact same image or video on both my pc screen and on my hdtv screen and here lies my problem, as i stated in my original post, i am unable to do so using the fn/f8 keys or the microsoft key/p options i have on my pc keyboard. 
using these keys i can see a video on either the pc laptop screen or on the hdtv screen but not on both at the same time which is what cloning or duplicating means? the internet posts related to this issue recommend using my nvidia control panel to achieve cloning, i have also tried that approach with no sucess because when i go there, i do not have choice for cloning, it seems it doesnt recognize or detect a second monitor ? 
graphic card is nvidia ion
