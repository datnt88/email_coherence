well, first, thanks richard and bill. 
if i was confident virtual software protection worked, i'd adopt that. 
i will looked into the open source software; thanks, richard. 
and, bill, i spent two and half hours with 3gstore support, trying different firmwares and redoing speed tests and then trying it without the router. the support person was extremely nice, but ultimately seemed to conclude that maybe it was my 32 bit win7 starter with ie9, which seemed odd because cradlepoint states windows 7 had been tested and worked. 
may i voice a suspicion that maybe all the field testing has not been done except by consumers (?); i don't know. 
anyway, this sounds like a quest for don quixote with some windmills to tilt at. 
i get the impression more and more that maybe this hardware doesn't exist. 
and that strikes me as odd as the tech emphasis is mobility, and more and more people have to be using highly portable usb modems to connect laptops, tablets, ereaders, etc. but maybe i'm wrong there. 
what do cell phones use to protect their networks? 
the long and short is happy holidays and thanks very much for the information!
