hello, like others have said, you need more ram, fact. 
i just have to say why not try linux? 
you can use one of the many live versions out there to see how it runs or if it will. 
have a old and mean old gateway 433c with only a 10 g hd but am running 256 mem. 
tried linux xp on it finaly installed fedora core 4 on it. 
linux knoppix 3.7 live cd is the one that runs good on it. 
am a win. 
person but linux sure has turned my head. 
good luck.
