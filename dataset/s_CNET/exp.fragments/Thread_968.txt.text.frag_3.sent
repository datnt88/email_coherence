if you are going to run several applications at one time then go for intel processor with ht. if you are going to run one application at one time, then amd 64 is the best performer. 
since your budget is too high, i think you can buy 2 pc in the same amount with same configuration. 
i think this one as the best,just check out this model: hewlett-packard pavilion media center desktop with amd athlon 64 x2 processor 4200+ model: m7470n you have to add video memory and 2gb ram
