brian, you might also see huge increases in performance by upgrading your processor. the pentium 4 is an old processor using old architecture. 
current core 2 duo or core 2 quad processors not only consume less power but will also give you a significant performance boost. 
for example, a core 2 quad 8300 can convert 29 hi-res photos into a video slideshow more than 5x faster than a pentium 4-630 (a 3.0 ghz processor. 
also, most consumer software suites out there today are optimized to take advantage of multi-core processors. 
i realize that you probably cant upgrade your processor with your current mb, perhaps an investment in a new system would be worthwhile.
