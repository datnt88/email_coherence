hi, i fixed it! 
what i did ... i created another profile, documented the key commands in the display property dialog box, and chose a plain windows theme. 
went back into the problem profile and went through the steps. 
it worked! 
this got rid of the corrupt theme and fixed the issue. 
my thought .. there may have been some files missing on the problem theme that caused a glitch. 
thank you for all of your help! 
sincerely, scharry ps. no more 3rd party themes!
