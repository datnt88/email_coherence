okay, so i know little about the inner workings of pc's, but i'd like to upgrade mine. 
basically all i want is to be able to play most games without slowdown and the like. 
i currently have an emachines e4028, and was wondering what sort of upgrades would be suitable. 
i have tried looking at graphics cards, but i just get confused. 
someone has offered me an 'xfx pv-t34k-nahg 5200 nvidia agp' graphics card, but apparently i already have 128mb in onboard graphics? 
oh, and i am on a budget, being a student! 
if anyone could help i'd seriously appreciate it. 
cheers, james
