ok. take the side cover off the system and lay it on its side with the motherboard on the bottom. 
if there is only one ribbon (flat) cable leading to the motherboard, determine that there is a &quot;secondary&quot; ide connector on the motherboard. 
earlier motherboards place these connectors side-by-side. 
if only one ribbon cable is used: obtain another ribbon cable and install it with the new drive in an empty bay. 
either put the jumpers located in the rear of the drive at &quot;master&quot; or &quot;cable select (cs)&quot;. 
power up the system. 
install the cd that came with the drive, using the other cdrom. 
reboot and your new drive should be ready to go. 
if two ribbon cables are used: you should connect the new drive on the same cable as the current cdrom. 
determine how the old drive is set by the jumpers. 
you have a choice here. 
either make them both cs or one master and the other slave. 
do not make one cs and the other master/slave. 
windows doesn't like that. 
always make sure the system is unplugged when you do anything with the motherboard. 
hope this helps and let me know if you are confused about anything! and life goes on... jack
