the name may change slightly. 
in my asus it is in the power mgt section and called &quot;ac pwr loss restart&quot; does what you say when &quot;enabled&quot; i use that mode to turn everything on by hitting the switch on my surge protector. 
after shutting down and turning off the switch on the surge protector the system thinks that there was a power loss. 
when the power is restored the system will boot up. 
of course it could be something else.
