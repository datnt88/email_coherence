- in your web browser's address bar, type in 192.168.0.1 - you will be asked for a login id and password. 
if not set by your isp to something different, it should be &quot;admin&quot; for login and &quot;password&quot; for the password - on the left side of the screen, go to the setup section and choose &quot;wireless settings&quot; - on the wireless page, you can rename your network (ssid) if you'd like, but to add security choose at minimum wpa, but preferably wpa2 with aes if available. 
below that, enter your own wireless password. 
- once you choose &quot;apply&quot;, you will lose access to the router since it you have made it secure. 
you will need to reconnect all of your wireless devices with the ssid and password that you created. 
on pc's, you will probably need to remove the existing wireless network name since pcs will try to connect to the same ssid with the old settings, and your connection will fail.
