i would like to ask you if it is possible to extent wifi range with one extra wifi router. 
i have one wifi router which is connected to dsl line with ip address 192.168.254.1 and its lan ip is set up to 192.168.2.1 and dhcp range from 192.168.2.2 to 192.168.2.30. 
mask is 255.255.255.0 in all cases. 
i have bought one additional router because the range of antenna was not satisfied and i need to extend the range around couple of meters. 
due to it was the most convenient solution for me. the first router is us 125bg and the second one is cnet cwr 854. 
all both of them are brand new router and operate perfect as stand alone. 
problem is in reconnection all of them. 
when i tried to connect them together via air they are not so communicative that why i am asking for you help. 
despite i have already researched all internet i did not find any proper diagram which can help me in my troubles. 
i hope that it is possible to use one additional router as an ap. the additional router had following configuration: lan: ip 192.168.2.40, mask 255.255.255.0, gw 192.168.2.40 wan only dhcp no any special configuration, perhaps nothing is connected to its wan port, wifi method is set up as wds+ap. 
if you require any specific information regarding this issue i am ready to support you. 
very many thank for your ideas and references, kind regards, martin.
