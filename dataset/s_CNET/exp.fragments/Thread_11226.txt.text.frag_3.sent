i think the logic is that with artic silver 5, they don't want you to &quot;pre-spread&quot; the stuff at all. 
this seemed surprising to me at the time. 
it's consistency dictates that you add the rice-sized drop and allow the application of the heatsink to do the work for you. 
i e-mailed artic silver and they said that using this method eliminates &quot;air gaps&quot;... and that if you &quot;pre-spread&quot; the compound before appyling you would most likely have air gaps. 
off i go! cheers.
