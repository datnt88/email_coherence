windows 98 (and later se) were from a time before usb memory sticks became widely available. 
you'll have to carry the driver either on cd or floppy so 98 (any version?) can see the stick. 
here's an idea. 
see if damn small linux can be on a fat formatted usb memory stick. 
then boot from said stick and copy the files out.
