the 9600pro is the main 'weak point'. 
next, upgrade to 1gb to give the games more ram. the cpu is ok for the titles you've mentioned but by the end of this year, even entry level cpus will surpass it. 
less than $350 would get you a new pci express mobo (nforce 4 chipset - $70), a better video card (nvidia geforce 7600gt - $170; or ati radeon x1800gto - $185), and a gig of ram (2 512mb ddr-400 - $80). 
this upgrade would last longer than just a geforce 6600gt agp ($145) or a radeon x1600pro agp ($120).
