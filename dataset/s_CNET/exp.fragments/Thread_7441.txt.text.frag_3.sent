sorry bob, been away from the forum for a while, i am using the cable supplied with the drive (wd1600) but i had the same problem with the previous cable that was in there too. 
i'm fairly sure it's up to snuff now. 
i have not done anything with mobo drivers. 
not sure what mobo this is any more, i will figure that out and do an update. 
do i need to do drivers or flash bios too maybe? 
thanks --fj
