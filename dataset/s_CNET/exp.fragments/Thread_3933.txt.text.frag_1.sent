i dropped it and now there is no led indicator light lighting up. 
and it will not show up in my computer. 
i managed to strip it down to this. 
so the first thing i notice is that this chip is loose. 
and on the underside, it has 4 metal contacts, so we know that it goes there in that missing spot. 
however, it could orient either way, and i've tried holding it there myself and plugging it in, but to no avail. 
so, now i'm stuck here. 
i really need to recover this.thanks.
