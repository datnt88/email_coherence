i think i decided on the mb or mbp. 
don't know which one yet. 
i'm leaning towards the mb, since i can hopefully buy the extra monitor, new camera, and speakers, etc, with the money i save. 
so, say i went with the pro, i might not be able to get a new camera or monitor. 
don't know yet though. 
and if i bought this to replace my pc, then should i go with the pro over the mb. thanks treeman
