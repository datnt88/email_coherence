i have a grid 19dbi outside antenna with 400 cable with a rp-tnc to male connector on the end of the cable. 
i have wifi here but it is weak. 
i have a linksys wrt54gs router. 
how can i connect my outside antenna cable to the internet plug of my router? 
then i think i can get a stronger signal. 
thanks in advance lwl0913
