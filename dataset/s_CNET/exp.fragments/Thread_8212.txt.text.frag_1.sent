i currently have a 19&quot; trinitron crt (14&quot; horizontal viewing width). 
due to eye surgery and eyeglass issues i have to get a monitor as low to the desktop as possible to avoid having to look upward too much. 
i'm looking at both 17&quot; lcd and 19&quot;lcd. 
i understand that the native resolution is 1280 x 1024 for maximum clarity. 
right now i have my crt at 1024 x 768. 
here are my questions: assuming that i have to have the maximum clarity, should i make the logical assumtion that the icons, etc. are going to be smaller than on my 19&quot; crt. 
would the 19&quot; lcd give me larger icons than the 17&quot;. 
this can be a potential problem because the 19&quot; screen size will be taller and i will have another 2&quot; to look up. 
how tall is the viewing height on each. 
width can also be an issue here becasue i don't have as good peripheral vision now and want to minimize moving my head from side to side. are there any lcds width a native resolution of 1024 x 768? 
also would a digital video card do anything here. 
thanks, marc
