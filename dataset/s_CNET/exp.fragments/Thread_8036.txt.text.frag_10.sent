from an electrical standpoint the modem maker can't warrant the device because they can't control proper grounding of both pcs. 
if the electrical design isn't done to plug both in at the same time, then and if the pcs are not on the same ground then the modem will be damaged. 
this is unlikely, but when i write manuals i have to error on the side of caution. is that what you needed to know?
