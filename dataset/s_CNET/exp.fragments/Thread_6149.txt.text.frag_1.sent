hello all, i have been thinknign about investing in a budget inkjet printer that can printer labels right on cd/ dvds. 
$100-200 range. 
i have been reading both priase and horror stories of epson and i see no hp printers (my preferred brand) that print dvd labels (inkjet) any suggestions? 
thanks - fj
