1) the 2600pro will need a floppy power connection but shouldn't overtax your power supply since you'll hardly ever be in 3d mode. 
3d mode is when the gpu draws the most power. 
2) &quot;sharpness&quot; is really subjective. 
you'll have to try it and judge for yourself. 
3) extra ram on a video card (past 128mb) is of no use in 2d mode (non 3d gaming). 
256mb is enough for 32bit true color on dual 1920 res screens. 
if you're using vista aero it will be using the graphics card 3d mode, but even it only requires 128mb. 
photoshop doesn't use any of your video card's ram.
