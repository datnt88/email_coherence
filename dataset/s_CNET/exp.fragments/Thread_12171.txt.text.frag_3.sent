yes kees the game got installed and running and ,it might be the program but the game is not performing at it should be. 
i just installed the new painkiller overdose and the game is taking ages to load around 2 minutes is it possible? 
and when graphic goes very high meaning to much light and effect (fog, rain ) and i am running it at standard graphic not high or extreme it is performing very slow could it be that the games do not or are not compatible to core 2 cpu? 
regards alex
