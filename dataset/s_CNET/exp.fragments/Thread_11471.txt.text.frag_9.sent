again, i'm trying to keep things simple and smart. 
a single platter seems to be easier for the heads than going to a second platter and since i don't need more than 20g of storage for my os & programs why get a bigger drive than one platter at 160g? 
from what i've read, wd uses the same platter for larger storage on this newest 160g hdd with 16mb cache. 
does anyone know if the single platter is inferior or just the same? 
and would there be a huge difference in 7200k vs 10k because the price difference is huge $60 vs $200... thanks!
