i have found that a difference of one year is like day and night with both computers using vista. 
my old more expensive unit took forever to start up or shut down. the new cheaper one is very quick. the best thing is i had to jump thru hoops to run my old programs on the older computer but the newer one runs these programs without a problem. 
years ago, when a computer cost thousands of dollars, it was expensive to upgrade. 
now adays, $500 can get you a pretty good machine. 
if you are a gamer and need a better machine. 
there are a number of places who will build a super one for you for a $1000 that will last a good long time.
