thanks so much, i did as you say, i disabled dchp on the dlink and is now hooked into one of the 4 ports of the cellpipe into one of the 4 ports of the dlink. 
it seems to be working fine now - all my computers have switched over to the new subnet of 192.168.2.xx however, i can get access to the original dlink router setup page (presumably left at 192.168.0.1) - how do i get access back into the original dlink router? 
it doesn't show up in my cellpipe device table - what's its setup page? 
i tried just connecting one computer to the dlink by itself to see if i can re-set the setup page to something in the 192.168.2.xx range, but the old 192.168.0.1 setup page isn't responding - is it because i disabled dchp on the dlink that it won't accept new connections? 
currently everything is working and my old wifi settings from the dlink still seems to be working, but i would like access to the setup page in case i need to change a wifi setting sometime in the future. 
thanks
