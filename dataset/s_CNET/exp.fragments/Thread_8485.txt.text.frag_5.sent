like bob said. 
. . 
unless you open the dmz on that router, you're safe. 
don't get too paranoid. 
and some port scanning software/web sites will try to sell you something to close those ports. 
when i tried that site it wanted to set a cookie. 
why? 
i don't know, and i denied it and i won't be back. 
btw, there are almost 40,000 ports on a pc. are you gonna try to close them all? 
please, don't worry about it.
