my computer has a year old cd/dvd drive and a blu-ray drive that can do cd/dvd as well, but both see to be having troubles playing audio cds. it will find the cd, but will only play part of tracks 1 and 9. and in the computer selection it says the audio cd has 0 bytes free of 0 bytes. 
my os is 32 bit vista ultimate. 
does anyone know a solution?
