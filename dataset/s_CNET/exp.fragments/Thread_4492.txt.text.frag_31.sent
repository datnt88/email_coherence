you're suggesting the build failed because of me? 
there is no &quot;receipt for the machine&quot;. 
i can't return the parts if they appear to be working, that's why i was asking if the parts could be partly damaged or weekend. 
how can i get them replaced, like the hard drive? the retailer won't help and i doubt the manufacturer will either. 
plus prebuild is a few hundred more expensive.
