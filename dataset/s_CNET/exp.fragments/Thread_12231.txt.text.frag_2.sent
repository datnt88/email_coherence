the typical fan is run from the +12v supply line. 
in the pc design, this is a &quot;bulk&quot; power supply and will vary more than a few percent. the human perception level of change is about 2 percent. 
when the +12v current draw increases the fans may spin down some rpms since the bulk power supply voltage can drop. 
this is by design and not a performance consideration. 
but new designs are going to have to be made since such variences cause support calls. 
in closing, the fan variences are not to be fixed.
