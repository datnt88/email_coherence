you should try updating the wireless-b notebook adapter. 
think about it: you probably have updated your windows operating system more than 10 times over the past 2 years (via windows update). 
when was the last time you updated the driver for your wireless adapter? 
for example, if you have a linksys wpc11 wireless-b notebook adapter, the latest driver was released on 12-feb-2004. 
check out also, see if there is a firmware update to download and install on your router. 
just to add to what ''pigonthewing'' wrote, another advantage of g over b is better wireless security.
