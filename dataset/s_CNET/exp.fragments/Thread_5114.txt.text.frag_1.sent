i'm getting an asus essentio cg5275-ar003 that i will be using for gaming. 
but i want to get a video card for it seen as it only has an integrated card. 
i'm already shellin out 700 bucks for the computer so i cant spend to much on the card only 100-150. 
i dont know much about the subject so please help.
