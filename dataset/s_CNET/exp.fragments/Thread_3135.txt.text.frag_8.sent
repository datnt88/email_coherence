i have the same problem with the same motherboard. 
i replaced the blown mb in my emachines t1742 with the biostar and now the cpu fan spins, but i don't get any post beeps or display. 
i sent the first mb back and got a replacement, same thing. 
i replaced the memory dimm, same thing. 
the board has built-in vga, lan, etc and nothing shows on my monitor when i power up. 
i have double checked all the wiring and it's ok. 
i sent biostar an email asking for some tech support. 
i re-seated the cpu and even tried another of the same cpu i have here and still nothing. 
i've run out of ideas.
