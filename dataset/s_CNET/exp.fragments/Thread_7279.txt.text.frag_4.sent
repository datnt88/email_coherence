this will depend on what equipment your internet provided uses. 
i would say for the most part you will need a router (it's a better idea for security reasons anyway.) but i was surprised to find that with my internet connection (w/ the supplied modem) i was able to plug in a switch and get directly to the internet from both machines. 
if you already have a switch laying around you could try it out.
