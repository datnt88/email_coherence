hi, andrew: if you provide some information on your current router, you may get more specific help. 
you didn't mention if you felt that the bandwidth usage was coming strictly from your customers, but my first recommendation would be to make sure your wifi is password protected with wpa2 security. 
you or your employees can happily give out the password when a customer asks. 
this will avoid nearby customers (say from that business next door) from using your internet connection. 
another option you may have available in your router is to set a maximum bandwidth usage (usually, in kbps). 
this might allow you to set a limit that still allows casual web browsing but deters video watching because of the hiccups and buffering it would cause. 
to really attack the problem, you'll need to invest in a firewall. 
the least-expensive option would be some basic (even older) pc running linux with free firewall software. 
there are a number of options that would allow blocking video/audio streaming, and they probably already have the settings ready-to-go, just needing to be enabled. the only downside is that you'll either need someone who is reasonably tech-savvy or you'll need to learn enough to install linux and configure the firewall software. 
there are, of course, stand-alone firewall appliances, but they cost somewhat more than the diy linux solution. 
once we know more about your specific setup, we may be able to help with settings your router may provide.
