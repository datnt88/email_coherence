hello world, i just wanted some peoples advice on what parts i should buy for my computer. 
around september, i can afford to buy something for about 150, i don't think i can go over that. 
anyway, i was wondering how best to use this money, if i can, to upgrade my pc. i should also specify i use my pc for gaming, so anything that would improve its power/speed would be useful. 
i will post my specs, and i would appreciate if you guys could suggest what use my 150 should go to. 
btw, i live in the uk, so i cant get stuff shipped from american companies as it would cost loads. 
thanks for your help in advance, mahfuz.
