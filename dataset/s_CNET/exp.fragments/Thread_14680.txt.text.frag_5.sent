ok, as promised, i got my answer worked out. 
unfortunately, the forms here didn't seem to want to properly format my simiple text diagrams (at least in the 'preview' mode. 
so i set up my answer, including diagramming **my** network configuration on my web page at the following link: hope it works the same for you. 
have fun. 
i have found it nice a couple of times to move a computer to a new location and be able to use it wirelessly instead of trying to figure out how to route cables. 
i'll leave the page up for the forseable future. 
good luck.
