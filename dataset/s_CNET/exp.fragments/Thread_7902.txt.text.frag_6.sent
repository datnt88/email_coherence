i have learned so much about memory! 
i used the system scan tool and it showed that i have 512 installed ea in slots 1 and 2 and it gave me the recommended upgrades. 
i cannot thank you enough for your help. 
any further suggestions you have would be appreciated. 
now onto upgrading the hard drive! 
i didn't realize they had speeds. 
i know, rookie mistake.

i know i'm annoying... but i'm cute.
