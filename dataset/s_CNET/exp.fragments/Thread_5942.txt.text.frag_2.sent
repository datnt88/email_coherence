at you will find a whole section of reviews about this very subject. 
i do know that the sony video cameras, the ones with a hard drive, will work with imovie09 avoid any camera that records directly onto a dvd mini disk. 
two reasons; 1. it is virtually impossible to edit the video as it must be converted from dvd format back to something that can be edited. 
2. you cannot play the mini disk in your computer if it has a slot loading dvd drive, most new apple machines do. 
good luck p
