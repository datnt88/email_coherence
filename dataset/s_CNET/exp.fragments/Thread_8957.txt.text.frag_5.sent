i installed viausb 2 drivers, (could not find any at ecs).uninstalled usb in safe mode, they reinstalled etc. still no change. 
any more ideas? the computer knows it is a usb 2 device when i plug it into the hub so even if port was usb 1 it should still find it and give same message, right? 
why would port find hub and not the enclosure?? i do not understand.
