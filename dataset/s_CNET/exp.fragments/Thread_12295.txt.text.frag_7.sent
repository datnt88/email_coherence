thanks for the help. 
did get an enclosure, but the interface is wrong. 
my drive (an ibm travelstar) has a wider interface than the enlcosure, with two layers of ~20 pins. the enclousure (a dynex) has only one layer. 
did i get a sata interface for a pata drive? 
as usual, the help is sincerely appreciated.
