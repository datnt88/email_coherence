hi there, i am running windows xp pro on my pc, windows vista on my laptop, and seem to be having issues regarding file sharring. 
file sharring has worked in the past, however i am having trouble after some recent changes. 
both computers are on the same network. 
i have installed lttd on the xp machine. 
when i view network map on my laptop, i am able to see my desktop connected on the network. 
when i go into network on my laptop however, i am not able to see the shared folders that i have on my xp machine. 
also to add, when i am running azureus on my desktop, i am able to see a media folder under networks on the laptop. 
any ideas as to why i cannot see my shared folders? 
thank you
