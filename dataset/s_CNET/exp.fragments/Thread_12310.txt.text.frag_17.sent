for kazaa i used kazaabegone to toss it all out. 
it is very important to have winsockfixxp handy since tossing out kazaa's tweaks can kill an internet connection. 
at this point you are squarely in the usual p2p user issues area. 
i'm no longer surprised but please don't take that wrong. 
you might cure it yet.
