got two questions for the experts here. 
first, when i try to share files/folders, they always are marked as read-only, even after i have granted others to modify files in the shared folders through the security tab. 
if i uncheck the read-only box, and apply the change, it still reverts back to being read only. 
this is on my desktop running winxp media center edition (99% sure this is a variant of xp pro). 
for the time, i have gotten around this by turning off simple file sharing and allowing full access to everybody on every shared folder. 
i don't really like that idea, but for now that's what i have to do. 
my second question is this. 
i can see and access my desktop files from my laptop (sometimes not until after a few minutes of being on the network), but i can not see the laptop from the desktop, nor can i see the desktop itself on the workgroup computers. the laptop has winxp home, and winxp media center (pro?) on the desktop. 
i have disabled all known software firewalls, incl. 
win icf with no luck whatsoever. 
any ideas? 
thanks!
