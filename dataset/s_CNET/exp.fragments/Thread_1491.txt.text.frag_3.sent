that's my thinking. 
i think the print head went bad. 
since i posted my query, i was able to locate and remove the print head. 
i am not sure if i have it in properly, but i doubt the problem was the print head becoming &quot;unshipped&quot;. 
there is no change in the printer's error message. 
it's amazing how regardless of use or cost, they never seem to last more than three years. 
thanks
