if a part truly fails, it may take out other devices/items/buss as part of the overall problem. 
thus, when you replace the primary cause, it doesn't address the secondary ones. 
it becomes a shotgun approach to fix things. 
though, in the final fix usually far more is replaced to resolve the problem(s). 
also, these 2ndary problems can return or fault the primary problem to return. 
it becomes nightmare until a whole rebuild is done using *all new* parts again. 
alas, the actual power demands maybe simply outstripping the capabilities until it settles down. 
as it seems your safety features kick-in suggest either a power leg is being over-drawn or is never really meant. 
i find that 16x video slot troubling and only the mtrbd., being replaced should help narrow it down. 
if possible reduce the system to its basics, lowest level and then retry to boot, etc.. otherwise, you may have a bad combo or still yet bad parts or return of bad action if all the bad parts aren't removed. 
i would sort out the power connections to best spread out the load as well.
