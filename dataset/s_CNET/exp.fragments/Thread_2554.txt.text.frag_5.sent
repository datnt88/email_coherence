i have a 4 port ms dos pci serial expansion card containing a nm9845cv chip by moschip. 
i can not get this card to work. the card manufacturer is not labled but packaging refers to &quot;best ports connection&quot;. 
my bios acknowledges the card but the the bios and driver monitor tells me that the com ports need to be reconfigured. 
moschip.com has driver information and documentation but not enough for me to configure the com ports for my application. 
anyone have information on this card or how to configure the com port parameters?
