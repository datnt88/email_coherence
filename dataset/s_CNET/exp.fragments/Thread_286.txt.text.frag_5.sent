bob: thanks for your reply, i did also try that yesterday and it was taking forever about an hour 1/2 waiting and i finally got to chat with someone he ended up wanting me to chat with him thru another computer so we could look into the bios. 
i didnt have another computer so that was kind of a fail. 
guess i need to borrow someones laptop and attempt it again. 
i might take a look at what you suggested about installing in order, i was unaware of that. 
this is a shot in the dark but, a relative has the same exact computer as mine. 
what if i was to make a set of restore cd's and tried to load them into my computer using my xp serial number?? maybe??
