well, i read the top post, and then i went in and changed to wpa-personal. 
it took me a bit to do it correctly, but now i'm up and running again with wpa. 
so, now i will try this for a while and see if it works better. 
right now the speed is up to 54. thanks so much. 
i would be lost without you.
