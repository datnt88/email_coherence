this advice is downplayed. 
there is so little gained by doing this and it does break connectivity on many products. 
i write &quot;don't do that.&quot; 
listen to cnet's real deal podcast and see what they say at &quot;episode: real deal 41 - wi-fi security robert vamosi joins tom merritt to talk about the proper ways to secure your wi-fi router in your home. 
they also discuss safety precautions to use when surfing over wi-fi in public.: i encountered a real issue recently with wep and mac filters taking a brutal exploit in minutes. 
in the next link i share my findings and ask if there is a new crack tool out. 
yes there is. 
read how to fix that at so if you research that new tool you find it gets the ssid in seconds. 
no gain, all pain.
