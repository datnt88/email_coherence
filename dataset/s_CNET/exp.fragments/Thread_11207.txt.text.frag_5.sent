backup is when you have a copy. 
now let's say you have a copy on your pc and that flash drive. 
that's barely a backup since when the pc is wiped out you only have the original and no copy. 
thus no backup. 
-&gt; try the stick in some other machine next. 
maybe your host machine is missing drivers after a reload. 
but i don't see that in the story so that would be me guessing badly.
