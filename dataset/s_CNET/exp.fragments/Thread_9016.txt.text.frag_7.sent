yep. do it pretty regularly. 
i have several externals that i have multiple file back-ups and simply plug both into the laptop and copy away. 
mostly one of those drives has an external power source and the other is usb powered, but once in awhile both are usb powered and that seems okay on my toshiba laptop.
