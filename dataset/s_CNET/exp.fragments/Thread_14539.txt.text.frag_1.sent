i've had a 400w psu for a few years, and i almost 100% sure its the cause of my crashing games and bsod's. 
i'm going to upgrade my gpu, but i'm pretty sure i'll need a beefier power supply. 
is there any good companies? 
i'd like to get something in the high 500's or even 600's watts. 
if you have any tips on how i need to change the psu it would be greatly appreiacted. 
i've been around and in the computer alot, but i'm not sure how to upgarde the psu. 
i hear antec makes good ones. 
thank you ibrahim jadoon
