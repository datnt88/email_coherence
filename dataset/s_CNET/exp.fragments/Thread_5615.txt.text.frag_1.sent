i rent a room in a house for 3 and i always get this feeling that someone is snooping around my external hd by plugging the hd into their laptop when i am not home. 
how can i password protect the hd or show only certain files? 
encrypting a 250 gig hd sounds like it takes forever so perhaps it is not a considered option?
