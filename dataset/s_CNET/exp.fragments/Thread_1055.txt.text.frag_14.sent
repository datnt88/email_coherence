there's nothing wrong with experimenting with your local network. 
wireless networking offers a special challenge because two wireless devices have to be able to sucessfully communicate. 
if you want to experiment with network layouts and network devices such as routers, switches, hubs, repeaters, etc., then it's best to work with hardwire between those devices. 
wireless networking follow the same rules of topology and layout with the added difficulty of trying to get two devices to talk wirelessly. 
if you can't connect two devices wired, then you probably can't do it wirelessly. 
keep on experimenting with your network layout. 
don't be afraid to use wires 'cuz they still offer a better method for two nodes to communicate. 
you can hide the wires up in the attic. 
keep your network simple enough as long as it does what you want it to do-- good luck to you
