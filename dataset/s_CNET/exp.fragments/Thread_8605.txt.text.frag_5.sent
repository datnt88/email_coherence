this is covered in the forum sticky but many don't read that or want to understand it. 
i'll give the short version. 
1. router defaults please except what the isp needs. 
2. simple ssid. 
short, 8 or so characters from 0 to 9, a to z and a to z. 3. change the rf channel if it falls on 1 or the highest channel. 
you could do some sort of site survey to find open channels but for now try channel 2. 4. test and see if it works with no security. 
5. now secure it with wpa2 aes (personal) and use a simple short password with the same rule as step 2 this should be secure for at least 2 days given the new cracking software out there. 
if it slows down, change the password every 2 days until they give up.
