before i received your reply i took a brave step and removed the filter. 
just didn't know one key would do the trick, and quite frankly, when my crash happened recently, it was because some techie gave me instructions to repair xp and it got stuck in that horrible loop. 
also, i end up with crazy problems because i do take risks when instructed to do so by those who are supposed to know how. 
probably will get a mac someday, $$$$! 
reg mechanic has helped in the past with various things, but i now use it sparingly. 
i've wondered about the effect on the registry overall. 
i'll check itunes too... enough said, my drives are back, and thanks so much! 
sincerely, amy
