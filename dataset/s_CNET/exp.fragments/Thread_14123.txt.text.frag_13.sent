&quot; the previous two works perfectly &quot; and i'm guessing the other two are also 32gb sandisk cruzers and this stick does not work on other pcs per your words above so it's back to the store to exchange it. 
xp does not natively support 32gb memory sticks. 
here's a link about that issue. 
to gain support for such large drives we need xp to be all updated to sp3 as well install kb955704. 
sorry for all the posts above but there was some basic information missing.
