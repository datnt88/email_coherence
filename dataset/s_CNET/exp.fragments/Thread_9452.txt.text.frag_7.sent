goto and use their calculator to figure what they recommend. 
you needn't buy from them but get an idea of what you need. 
offhand, if the video card needs 100w and you install a 400w psu, don't you think among all those power demands, that its weak. 
you're installing a high-end card which wants more than a typical psu is outputting, so get what it needs. 
i can't stress how a decent psu is vital to a stable system for now and later. 
imho, you have an unbalanced power system. 
while wattage is a good indicator of psu rating, in your case, its the raw amps that are needed check the specs.
