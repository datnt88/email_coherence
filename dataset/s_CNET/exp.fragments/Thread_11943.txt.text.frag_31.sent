there are a few things not clear to me, bob. the instructions you give at the end of your last post apply to xp pro. it seems to me that those instructions imply anonymous access to files on that , i.e. the xp pro, machine. 
if that is true, how will it help, since the problem is access to files (presumably that's what &quot;shares&quot; means) on the xp home machine ( the upstairs one)? 
and the instruction number 8. what is a/the &quot;share name&quot;? 
to comply with previous information, does enabling the guest account on the one machine mean that i have to enable it on the other too, since you say both machines must be using identically named accounts? 
i'm sorry, but so many terms are either ill-explained or not explained at all on most, if not all, of the sites i look at. they all use jargon which assumes prior knowledge.
