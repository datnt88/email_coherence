i use three computers and i'm normally on one or another of them for extended periods. 
i let the others sleep, monitors off, so i can jump in on either of them without going through a full start up. 
i do shut them down if i'm away and if i know i won't need to access them, and on my days off. 
both days off. 
every year.
