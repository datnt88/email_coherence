because all i would ever need to do is set the default gateway for each lan. 
i've seen this discussion before and maybe you didn't detail enough to show why a proxy is needed. 
but for now, it's a bit simple. 
just a common ip setting. 
your new networker tends to use a proxy where none is required.
