how do i know those numbers? 
i bought a few watt meters to find out where and what uses what amount of power around the house. 
i'm sure i made my 20 bucks back as i found simple things like a cordless phone that was rarely used but drew 3+ watts 24x365 days a year among other bigger discoveries. 
heck that's only 26,280 watt hours i cut back with a 3 watt device! 1 pound of coal can generate 8,800/9,500 of a kilowatt-hour, or 926 watt-hours. 
so that single change cut my yearly use by 28 pounds of coal.
