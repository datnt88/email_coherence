hi, i need help to decide which macbook to get, or which one is better, i use it mostly to view movies, surf the web and use itunes. 
my decision has come between: a macbook air 2.0ghz intel dual-core core i7, turbo boost up to 3.2ghz 4gb 1600mhz ddr3l sdram 256gb flash storage ...(not sure if they have this one at my apple store, if not it will be mba 1.8ghz intel dual-core core i5, turbo boost up to 2.8ghz 4gb 1600mhz ddr3l sdram 256gb flash storage) and a macbook pro 2.9ghz dual-core intel core i7, turbo boost up to 3.6ghz 8gb 1600mhz ddr3 sdram &#8212; 2x4gb 750gb drive
