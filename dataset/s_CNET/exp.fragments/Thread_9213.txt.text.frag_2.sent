that won't work, sadly. 
a usb hard drive is not an os and doesn't have the software installed to talk to the router or manage networking. 
you will need some kind of nas (network attached storage) system where you can, if you wish, connect the hdd to if you want to use it as a network drive. 
there's more here; that said, i wonder if &quot;mapping the hdd&quot; would work? 
that usb drive connected to one computer on a network. 
the other computers on the network 'map' that drive so it behaves like a drive on them and they have access to it. 
but i am not sure about that.
