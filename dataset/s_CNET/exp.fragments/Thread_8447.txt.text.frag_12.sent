this is a topic that lots of people will have differnt things to suggest. 
people out there, wanting to upgrade, or build a new system now, sometimes can't wait (my intel system just crashed) and with all the newly developing options and outlooks make things more confusing than ever. 
as for what was said about waiting for the newer amd board, supporting faster memory, in most situations todays memory should be good enough... right? the question burning me up right now, is what current specs will be needed for future developments (os, dual core, 64bit, meory speed), and what will be optional/benificial.
