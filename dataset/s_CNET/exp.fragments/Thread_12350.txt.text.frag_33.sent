i have found for myself a perfect solution in a networked-shared drive that i can backup all pc's to. the brand was originally called netdisk by ximeta and i liked it so much i bought two. the great thing about these is that they can plug into a network with a cat5 cable or a usb port on a computer. 
software installation is required for network pc access when sharing on a cat5 connection but when used in usb mode it will add itself automatically to xp pro version without any software installation. 
sharing is then as any other drive locally. 
i use one as a networked storage on my router and the other as a usb on my main system for secure backups. 
when off it can't be cracked or vulnerable as most drives are when considering backups. 
one switch to turn it on and its available again to all computers setup to use it on your network. 
device id and password protection help keep altering the drives contents safe and sharing folders on the cat5 networked drive does not require a sharing pc to be on. the drive can always stay running and easily works through firewalls. 
(some require permission for unknown proticols.) the maker indicates that any ide drive up to 250gb should work (possible larger)i have found them to be rugged in construction and easy to transport. 
(ac required) this drive allowed me to solve the problem of all my computers running low on storage and sharing files while isolating one pc from another for security on my home network. 
happy computing, marko
