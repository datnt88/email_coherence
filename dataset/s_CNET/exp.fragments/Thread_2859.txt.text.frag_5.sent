all you need to decide is whether or not you want a &quot;professional&quot; graphics card. 
consumer cards will work with most cad/rendering apps, but may have minor incompatilities -- the professional card has been tested and has better drivers to ensure higher precision and compatibility. 
you need not worry about &quot;parts that go well together&quot; since all pci-express x16 cards will work in any pc equipped with an x16 slot. 
personally, i suggest you start with a mid-range quad core like this $800 gateway lx-6200, phenom x4 9500, 8gb ram, 750gb drive, vista 64bit and add a $100 geforce 9600gt . the 9600gt will exceed the raw performance of a $450 quadro fx1700.
