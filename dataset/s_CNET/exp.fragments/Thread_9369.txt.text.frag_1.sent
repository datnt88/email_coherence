i've contacted soundblaster to no avail. 
yesterday i installed a few things into my pc (wireless card and xp sp2) didnt notice the problem until i installed everything. the external hub isn't getting any power it seems. the sound card works fine, but nothing works on the box, and none of the inputs are available in windows. 
i really have no clue whats going on with it. 
i googled it up most of today without finding any information or support for the hub, i've tried the diagnostic program, updated all of my software/drivers, nothing has worked so far. the product has worked fine for about a year now, anybody here had a similar problem? 
thank you
