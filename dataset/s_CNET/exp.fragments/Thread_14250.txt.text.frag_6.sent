i got this problem sorted so just want to let you know what happened in case it happeneds to any of you and your pc goes dead. 
while i was investigating and talking to some tech guys they told me i should do 3 things before i take it into the store (because thats what they do first when they get it) 1. change the fuse in the plug 2. plug it into a different socket 3. take the cables out and hold in the power button for 10-15secs (this flushes out any static) turns out i hadnt fried my motherboard at all as i suspected but after doing step one i realised i add just blown the fuse. 
problem solved. 
maybe you wanna pass this advice onto any noobies with the same problem.
