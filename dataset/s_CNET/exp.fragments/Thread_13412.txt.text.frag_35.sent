dd-wrt is a third party firmware you can flash to your router, it's linux for your router, (this way you don't have to use a completely separate pc), using this you can control the speeds at which each customer accesses your internet and what ports are accessible. 
and with opendns you can block access (by domain) to websites of your choice (when you sign up for the service you'll see a list of different categories of websites you want to block), and if you want to unblock a website for a customer you can set a password for that too. 
of course opendns only blocks domains but you can monitor all traffic through dd-wrt and if you find anyone accessing websites by ip you can manually check what the ip leads to your self and block it if you decide it needs to be blocked.
