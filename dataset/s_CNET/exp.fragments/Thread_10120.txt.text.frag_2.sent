i see you read about the cpu for gaming. 
i'll copy it again here. 
&quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. 
it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines. 
&quot; the video card might be changed. 
i'd see how high i can go on this list. the psu is something of a problem area. is it a single rail? 
if not are you sure you won't exceed the amperes of any rail? 
part of the reason of getting a single rail is for folk that don't want to learn about this.
