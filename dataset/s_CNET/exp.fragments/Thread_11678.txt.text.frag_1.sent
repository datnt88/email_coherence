i have replaced my video card (ati 1800x wonder card) with the new radeon 3870. 
i have tried using the wonder card for video capture only but it seems to conflict with the primary 3870. 
it gives me 2 extra displays, but i don't need them and disabled those displays. 
ati tech support said it doesn't support the 1800x anymore so i cannot get any advice from them. 
does anyone know how to set up the two cards to work in the same machine. 
they are both pcix. 
i hesitate buying a new video capture card when the 1800 model is also a video capture card. 
any suggestions?
