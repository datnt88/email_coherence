while you can replace the fan itself and do just fine, it appears you're clueless as to what to get. the fan itself is measured in &quot;mm&quot; so likely you want a 60mm or 80mm fan, but again i don't what you have regardless of the info you found on your fan. 
but, if you choose to, look at: or similar websites. 
inquire the vendor if any fan or hsf you do get is suited for your needs and any return policy(surf abit). 
however, you'll do better getting a hsf(heatsink-fan setup) that is *rated* for your cpu/processor installed. 
so, if you have a 2.8mhz cpu, get a hsf that's rated for 2.8mhz or better and physically fits the location(in system) as some hsf are huge and maybe limited space to install or very tight fit. 
check this website for what to expect: and locate info.
