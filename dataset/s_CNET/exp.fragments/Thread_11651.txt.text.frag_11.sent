well i took the burner in and they tested it and found it worked fine and that it had to be my computer. 
i tried to get into the bios but couldn't. it says to click on f12 which i did and when it opens i get a page about booting and after a few minutes it starts the computer. 
what i don't understand is that sometimes i get a notice that it is working fine but another program tells me i don't have one and borth nero and starburn tell me to insert a disk when one is there already. 
i suppose this means i will have to take the computer in
