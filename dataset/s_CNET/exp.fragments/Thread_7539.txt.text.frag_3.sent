as another poster mentioned, rom is read only. 
windows xp didn't have burning capability onboard, you'd have to use an aftermarket burning software to accomplish the task, roxio, nero and others. the external drive dvd/cdrw is going to pose the same issue, it needs software to run against. 
even is the system recognizes it as a usb device it will not likely burn anything without software installed in the system.
