&quot;setup: plug into a power supply and connect to the router using an ethernet cable, and the box is up and running. the installation software failed to find the device but after manual setup it now correctly reports host name (user defined name for nas device), workgroup, ip address, subnet mask, mac address, firmware version and how much space is being used on the device. 
there is a download to correct this problem on the buffalotech website. 
&quot; seems as-is it's not ready for the market. 
why do companies continue to ship carp?
