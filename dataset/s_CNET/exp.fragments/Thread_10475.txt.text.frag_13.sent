i want to do that, but i am still downloading ultimate boot and it takes forever to download 68 mb on dial-up. 
sometime tonight i will try my luck with reinstalling windvd 6 tial version.i 
looked up microsoft system information utility and under components, in storage it lists hard drive, floppy and both cdrom and my unhappy dvd drive as well.
