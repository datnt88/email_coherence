the most common cause for this is there is one or more pgms. 
already running in the bkgrd. 
doing thier tasks, thus the defragger repeats when in conflict. 
i suggest you hit the clt+alt+del keys once and see what's running, and kill the tasks not required(leave ms ones) for the time being and allow the defragger a chance to finish. 
you can also, check the &quot;startup&quot; of files to see if you can disable during such defragging. 
if your systemtray is more than 3-4 icons present, check them to disable, try one at a time for best operation. 
check into areas... good luck -----willy
