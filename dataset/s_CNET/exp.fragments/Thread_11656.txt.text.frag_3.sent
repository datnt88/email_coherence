if you buy the faster memory it will still run at the speed of your fsb. that will not change with faster memory, so the speed will be no different. 
you would have to boost the fsb and that would require at least a processor upgrade (if not a motherboard upgrade as well). 
buying faster memory expecting to use it in the future is almost always a waste of time, because the memory requirements change every couple of years, and that memory will most likely not be fast enough for your next system.
