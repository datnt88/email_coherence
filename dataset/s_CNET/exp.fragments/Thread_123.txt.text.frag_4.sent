thanks s and bob. 
apparently s didn't read about my ignorance as to the &quot;bios&quot;. 
i don't even know what that is, much less how to check if my motherboard can handle this. 
can you guys help me there? 
how would i check to find out if it can support the new 80g? 
good point on checking for a slot for the new drive, s. duh...i just assumed it would fit. 
i swear, sometimes i feel like an idiot. 
i just assumed there would be room in there...it's a big tower...lol.
