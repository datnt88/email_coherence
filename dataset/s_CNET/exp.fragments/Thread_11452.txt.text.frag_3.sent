waz up sir mortis, i'm not sure what components are provide by creative, but i don't think they make mother boards either. 
so i think the best way to go at this is the simplest, just open your case and see who's the manufacturer of the motherboard. 
then go to their website to get latest bio. 
if you find no name most manufacturer stick to a specific circuit color on their mother board. 
like brown for &quot;asus&quot; and ... but not all mother board do support 1 gig of mem.
