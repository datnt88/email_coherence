sorry i should have mentioned. 
i did remove the side panel and used a box fan to cool the inside. 
i thought that this did reduce the number of shutdowns, but it still happened. 
and i am the one who put the heatsink on, i am fairly certain i did it correctly. 
covered in grease, pressed it on and locked it down. 
as for the bios, i will have to check on that. 
i know that the motherboard said 1066 standard memory, but apparently that is only with an am2+ processor, which was hidden in fine print i guess. the timings however were set to what the memory would be at 1066, with voltages for 800mhz. 
i upped the voltage. 
i also tried downing the timings to 800mhz, and the voltage. 
none of this helped the problem or worsened it. 
also on a side note. 
i was just looking into overclocking my video card, i used fear as a test. 
when i left everything at normal speeds, i got very high fps (min: 61 avg: 133 max: 272) i then overclocked by a little bit, and i got (min: 44 avg: 67 max: 96). 
this seems very odd and counterproductive?! i feel like my pc is stuck in a twilight zone =( thanks for helping though, anymore ideas/suggestions/information would be greatly appreciated. 
i've built plenty of pcs now and i'm somewhat stumped. 
if a heatsink on the motherboard were to have come undone somewhat, could this be the culprit?
