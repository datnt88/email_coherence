maybe you want to say either ibook or dell... try to configured the airport express and the router... check your ip address and ip address range.. (maybe it only allowed for 1 ip address) try to disabled dhcp on the airport express or try to use manual configuration on the airport express assistant. 
i assumed that you also have ethernet... try to bridge your wireless and the ethernet... on dell.
