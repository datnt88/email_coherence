the 20 & 23'' will run with a card, that has a dvd-i (analog/digital)connector and supports a resolution of 1920x108p. 
from the research i've done on the 30'' apple cinema, you need a card that supports a dual-link dvi-i digital connection, that can run this monitor at its native res of 2560x1600.
