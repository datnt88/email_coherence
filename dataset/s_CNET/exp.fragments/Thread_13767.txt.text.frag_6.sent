ok i tried a cd lens cleaner and i was able to burn a cd properly again. 
i though &quot;great,&quot; and i'll try to see if dvd read functionality has been restored later. 
before i tried to see if i could read a dvd(about a week later) my whole drive disappeared! 
it's not listed in my computer, i can't find it in the device manager and if i try to type in &quot;d:&quot; to a address field it comes up with [cannot find 'file:///d:/'. 
make sure the path of internet address is correct.] 
any ideas on getting my cd rom drive back?
