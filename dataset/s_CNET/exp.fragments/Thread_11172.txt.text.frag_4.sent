if device manager shows nothing wrong, and it doesn't connect, consider the possibility it's broken. 
the easiest way i see to check that and possibly get it working are: 1. back to linux. 
see if it works. 
2. if it works in linux, repeat the installation of windows xp exactly as you did it the first time. 
then it should work like it did the first time. 
that's rather time-consuming. 
adding a new (usb or ethernet) wireless device is far easier.
