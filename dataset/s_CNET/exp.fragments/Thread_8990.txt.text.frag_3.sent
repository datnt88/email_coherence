- disconnect the router (repeater) from the 1st router and power cycle. 
- connect a computer to a lan port on the router (repeater) in order to configure it. 
if you can't log in, you may need to reset to factory defaults. 
- under &quot;advanced&quot; and &quot;lan setup&quot;, uncheck &quot;use router as dhcp server&quot;. 
then select &quot;apply&quot; and reset router. 
- connect the lan port from the first router to a lan port on the second router (don't use the wan or internet port). 
power cycle both devices. 
- you should be able to reconnect all devices with no ip conflict, since all devices will get an ip address via dhcp from the first router.
