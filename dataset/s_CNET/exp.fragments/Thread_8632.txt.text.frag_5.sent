you mentioned in your other post, buying a case with a psu, don't count on that psu. 
all too often its minimal output, in fact buy a better psu to handle your current needs and possible future demands. 
if you follow the posts here, psus are a common failure. 
they are the bedrock of a decent system and shouldn't be taken for granted. 
they often are and poof at some later date, they become an issue. 
you may want to reviews past posts on the topic, just use the forum search engine.
