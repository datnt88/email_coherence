i work for a 6 room bed & breakfast that is also a bakery/cafe. the owner wants all of the hotel rooms and the entire cafe area to be wifi enabled, and i'm the one tasked to make it happen. 
a coworker of mine tried to set up a system while i was out of town for the holidays, and failed miserably. 
using the hardware he bought, i've created a decent solution, but i want a better one. 
right now, i'm using a netgear mr814v2 as the router and wireless access point, with a netgear wg602v3 configured to be a repeater. 
with this system, range and connectability are okay, but the whole thing crashes about once a day and has to be power cycled. 
totally unacceptable to me. 
i'm imagining that this is happening because the router is cheapo and can't handle more than a few wireless connections at once. 
so i'm asking anyone out there with hotspot set-up experience: do you have any suggestions for what i should buy? 
i want a rock solid router that can handle at least 15 wireless connections at once without crapping out.
