what is the best modem/router combo? 
i don't want to &quot;rent&quot; the current modem ($7.00 per month) i have from comcast. 
i want to 1. stream internet tv from the router and 2. use my laptop wirelessly for browsing the internet. 
i have comcast cable internet with 20/5 service. 
thanks for any info!
