thanks for the reply, kees. 
i was over-simplifying, i think. 
my homework states that my company needs to receive blueprint files from a customer securely. 
i was thinking using a secure website as an interface for the file transfer. 
the customer would upload the files to the website and my company would retrieve the files. 
i was assuming that since it was a company sending me the files, that it would be one ip address because they should upload them from their work, which i would think would have one static ip for all outgoing traffic. 
my idea was to only allow the customer's static ip to have access to the website. 
i was thinking that the firewall rule would block all other ip addresses from accessing it. 
am i going about this in the entirely wrong way? 
my only experience with this sort of thing is that my (real, current) work receives marketing data from a vendor monthly, and the vendor has set up a website that we use to receive the files.
