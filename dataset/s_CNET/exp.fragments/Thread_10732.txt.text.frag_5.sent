you don't create any workgroup or not creating a network/lan... this is true that you can not be seen and can not seing other pc. 
(you can use different ip address range, to disable the lan connection, without breaking the internet connection) but, if you create a workgroup (even using different workgroup name from the other pc).. then you still can be seen by all connected pc on the lan. 
i.e.: i have several pc's, connected through lan (all windows xp pro), i have 3 workgroup names, which are: 'workgroup', 'home' and 'mygroup' all files and printer sharing is enabled. 
with that 3 workgroup names, i can see and share everything.. (within the shared documents folder, of course..) as for bandwith limiter, you should go with mg advice.. or google it for such utility etc.
