i have a dell m991 monitor and use nvidia geoforce fx5200 display adaptors. 
it is a dell 8300 and i run xp pro. 
when i turned on the maching yesterday, all the colors looked muted - where red should be in icons only black, no red in any of the cards, photos well i just simply closed photo preview. 
i got on line with dell support and we changed the color quality to 32 bit, and the screen resolution is at 800x600 since i require larger icons and text than normal. 
i uninstalled the driver and reinstalled the new one although no new driver was found. 
i did a restore system to a previous date but no change in color so i returned to original date. 
please help me as i would to look at my grandchildrens photos and right now the color is so faded that i prefer to wait until this problem is a last nights dream. 
thanks, mamajen
