i think it's a hardware issue. 
what spare network card is there? is there a bios &quot;defaults&quot; in the bios screen? 
why i ask is someone sometime had &quot;locked down&quot; the irq assignments and gummed up the works. 
they were remembering the bad old days of isa bus and needed a little push to pci.
