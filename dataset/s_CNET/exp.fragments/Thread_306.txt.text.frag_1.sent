i am new to the mac world. 
i just bought a dual g5 with all of the goodies however, am having trouble getting the airport to work seamlessly with my linksys wireless g router which runs two other systems in my home. 
as soon as i log onto the internet, i find that accessing web pages and so forth takes a very long time, almost as if i were connected via a dial up modem. 
i am able to see another wireless access point in my wireless icon at the top of the screen and when i click on it, it screams!! so, this is obviously my neighbors wireless system which i don't wish to use. 
i am upset however, that mine is so darn slow. 
it is slow whether or not my other computers are on using the wireless router. 
does anyone have any recommendations? 
thanks!!
