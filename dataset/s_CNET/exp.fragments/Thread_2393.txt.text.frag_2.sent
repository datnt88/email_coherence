normally, i would lead to the mounting screw pattern that would typically be on top and rear of pc case as those are aligned in one way. 
since, you mentioned a different location and really the psu doesn't matter here for the most part. 
which, i offer i like &quot;dual fan&quot; cased psus. 
they'll work w/o difficulty in any arrangement. 
if your psu has one fan, then should be &quot;direct ordinated&quot; , how does it work, in or out. 
you want the fan blowing out as its intended to exhaust int. 
heat build-up. 
if yours is ordinated to blow towards &quot;up&quot; and towards the mtrbd. 
and all it is, then the case fans come into play are that more important as they have to exhaust the heat build-up. 
typical pc fan placement is frt. 
draws &quot;in&quot; and rear pulls &quot;out&quot;. 
in other words you want airflow to be productive, install as required. 
any other fan is typically directional as it blows towards something or away, like the video card as example.
