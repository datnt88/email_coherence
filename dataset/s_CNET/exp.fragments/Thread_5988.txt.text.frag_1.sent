what is everyone's opinion on the advantages of an sli or crossfire setup? 
would i be better off building my new computer with say 2 7600 256 cards or getting 1 7900 card with maybe 512mb? 
also how hard is it to add a 2nd card later if i were to get a more powerful single card installed from the factory and then add another in 6 months when it is cheaper?
