i did not see an completely appropriate forum section for this question so networking it is. 
please redirect me if i am mistaken. 
i am doing some research on migrating off my mainframe system here onto a server system. 
my question is what physical machines and os have others used to do this. 
i am not asking for someone to tel lme exactly what and how i should do it, just give a generalknowledge of what others out there have done. the requirements i have are (1) quad processors (2) at least 8gigs of ram (3) at least 144gig of disk space oon at least 4 hot-swappable disks as i would like to make a raid 5 array and have a hot spare. 
i am currently looking at and trying to familirize myself with solaris by sun. it looks like a very capable os and sun looks to be making some great server machines. 
what do you guys think? 
thanks for you time.
