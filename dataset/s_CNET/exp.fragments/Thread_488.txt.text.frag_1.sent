i bought a brand new seagate freeagent 500gb usb desktop external hard drive from compusa (on sale for $120 + tax). 
i plan to use it on an older laptop running xp and hopefully a new pc (haven't bought yet) running vista. 
my question is: how can i get a bunch of data off an old pc running windows me ? the machine recognizes the device as a usb disk; but it is not available to browse in my computer. 
thanks in advance, s
