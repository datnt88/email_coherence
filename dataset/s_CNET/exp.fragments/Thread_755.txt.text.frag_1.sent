hey everyone, havent been on the forums in a while, especially not in the desktop section. 
my question today has to do with using an hdtv as a computer monitor. 
with black friday coming up i am currently contemplating picking up a cheap (~400$) 32&quot; 720p lcd hdtv, and using it as my computer monitor. 
i am running an hp s3600t desktop with the 256mb nvidia graphics card, 64 bit windows, 3gb ram, etc. how well will this work? 
i've heard of people doing it, but im not sure how this works for a basically average desktop system with a few upgrades in it.
