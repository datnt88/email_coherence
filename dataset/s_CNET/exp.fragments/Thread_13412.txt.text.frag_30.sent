why not simply file a police report? 
they are stealing your internet. 
this is a crime in many places. 
give them the mac address of the offenders. 
you should be able to determine those by the times and days that they use your internet. 
filter out the regulars and what is left over are the criminals. 
press charges and sue for damages. 
you could babysit the router though. 
each time a regular comes in you can add them to the acl. 
you just need to know their mac address. 
eventually you will have only regulars on the list and the bandwidth bandits will have to go elsewhere. 
just be advised that it is just a matter of time before they can gain access to your internet again. 
lots of software that can do that for them. 
if you hired a 'white hat' hacker to write a very nasty virus and inject it into bandwidth bandits' computer.... ya know, the kind that burns up the computer not just to software. 
if they use a macintosh computer or a linux distribution the hacker may have problems attempting to do that. 
if you know who is doing it you could drop them a hint that your bandwidth is being stolen and as soon as the fcc gets done pressing charges you will be suing as well. 
just don't say that you are accusing anyone specifically. 
you see, hacking a home computer is a minor offense, but hacking a business system (or business internet) is a much higher crime.
