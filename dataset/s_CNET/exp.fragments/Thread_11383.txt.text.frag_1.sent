hi guys, need advice on whether or not i should upgrade my rig. it has served me well for the past 3.5 years. 
i plan to upgrade the following components as my 670 gtx is perfectly fine: i7 920 ===&gt; i5 3570k asus p6t ===&gt; asus p8z77-v pro windows 7 premium 64 ===&gt; windows 8 do you think there is a need right now if my primary purpose is gaming (planetside 2 for example)? 
my i7 920 is stock and overclocking on air is not an option where i live especially during summer.
