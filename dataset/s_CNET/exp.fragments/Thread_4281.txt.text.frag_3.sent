a 7900gs for 120 will definitely outperform dual 7600gs and a 8600gts. the 8600gts will be a bit more expensive and will have dx10 support but will be a bit slower than the 7900gs but a smidge faster than dual 7600gs. 
and you won't have to deal with any sli-issues with either of these cards. 
512mb won't help the performance of a 7600gs that much so unless its 'free' stick with 256mb if you plan to go sli.
