i just upgraded an old hp 350 mhz, put 192 pc 100 and the key was a new 20 gig hard drive and it runs xp pro very well. 
it runs better than it ever has. 
i also did the same to a gateway 500mhz. 
put 192 pc 100 ram and again the key to it was a new hard drive. 
its running great also, with xp pro.
