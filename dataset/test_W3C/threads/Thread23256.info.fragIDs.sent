<s> I've looked at the three open issues on the DOM-2 HTML Module, and have the following comments based on my experience implementing the Spyglass Device Mosaic 3 DOM, which was based on reverse engineering of IE3 and NN3 behavior (and having to resolve occasional differences between the two): *** I6 HTMLFormElement::submit *** In DM3, the invocation of the submit() method causes the firing of the ONSUBMIT event prior to performing its intended semantics, and, if the event returns a value that is equivalent (coercable) to FALSE, then those intended semantics (form submission) are ignored.  </s>
<s> The same held in DM3 for the reset() method, which fired an ONRESET event (this event was introduced by NN3).  </s>
<s> *** I7 HTMLInputElement::size *** This property was interpreted as an integer by IE3 and DM3, so I see no problem with changing the IDL definition to a numeric type.  </s>
<s> *** I9 HTMLSelectElement::options.length *** In IE3 and DM3, the object referenced by the options property was definitely read-only, and did not support changing its length (i.e., number of items).  </s>
<s> I believe this feature was introduced in NN3.  </s>
