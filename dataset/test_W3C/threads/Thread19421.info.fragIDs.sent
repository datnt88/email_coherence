<s> Hi Mark, since there is a mailing-list dedicated to bugs reports on Amaya, I will Cc this reply.  </s>
<s> BTW you can read the mailing-list archive at the following URL :  </s>
<s> Subject: Amaya 0.8a BUGs: German umlauts always uppercase et al. Thank you for developing Amaya.  </s>
<s> It is great.  </s>
<s> The Structure View is what I have always been waiting for.  </s>
<s> With WYSIWIG typing in it.  </s>
<s> Great!  </s>
<s> There are, of course, a few bugs, at least I consider them to be such: - - German umlaut characters are always GENERATED in their uppercased form, although Amaya displays them right when browsing a document generated by some other editor.  </s>
<s> I have just tried to generate them again, and it seems to work !  </s>
<s> I have generated lowercase A umlaut by doing : pressing and releasing the Alt modifier pressing and releasing the A key pressing and releasing the " (double quote) key For the capital one : pressing and releasing the Alt modifier pressing the Shift modifier pressing and releasing the A key releasing the Shift modifier pressing and releasing the " (double quote) key Could you check these sequences.  </s>
<s> Was the umlaut mapped to another char on your keyboard (like a diacritic) ?  </s>
<s> I have copied the sequences available from the X11R6 Compose file : /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose  </s>
<s> - - Closing the last document closes the Application.  </s>
<s> I consider this a bug (it's contraintuitive).  </s>
<s> Sorry for this comparison, but even MS WORD is able to exist without a file to edit.  </s>
<s> This is a difficult point : having an external non editing small window a la Frameker was in the original design.  </s>
<s> We removed it but in this case all windows should be associated to one currently viewed document.  </s>
<s> Closing the last document in Word is not a good example, I really hate this empty space filling my desktop, I do prefer have it closed and restart the application.  </s>
<s> However having a small window around when all documents are closed is not perfect neither.  </s>
<s> It's all a matter of taste ...  </s>
<s> - - Sometimes the Structure View is not perfectly in sync with the WYSIWYG window.  </s>
<s> I was typing one char ahead.  </s>
<s> Waiting a few seconds did't help.  </s>
<s> Yes we initially decided that maintaining a strict coherency beween views was superfluous, you just need to move the cursor to another part to have the other views reflecting the new value of the text.  </s>
<s> Since you're not the only one to dislike the behaviour we will probably enable full coherency or add a timeout.  </s>
<s> BTW current CPU are so powerfull that they are iddle 95 % of the time.  </s>
<s> - - When typing in the WYSIWYG window, clicking e.g. the "Italics" button enters italics mode.  </s>
<s> OK so far.  </s>
<s> After typing a few italic chars one wants to change back to normal mode.  </s>
<s> Clicking the "Italics" button once again achieves this.  </s>
<s> But you can't go on typing in normal mode, because this second click also selects the italic text to become the active (highlighted) region.  </s>
<s> Simply typing ahead overwrites the whole (italic) region.  </s>
<s> Noted, the selection handling is not completely perfect, in progress ...  </s>
<s> - - There is no undo.  </s>
<s> Yes, ...  </s>
<s> - - The postscript files generated by printing to a file make my ghostview hang on the last page.  </s>
<s> strange, does it print anyway ?  </s>
<s> - - Edit menu: "Select all" button is missing.  </s>
<s> The escape key allows to select the englobing element in the structure.  </s>
<s> Since HTML document are often quite flat, this mean that pressing escape a few times obtain the same functionnality.  </s>
<s> Adding buttons is easy but if there is too many of them, it can be confusing.  </s>
<s> Is this one really needed ?  </s>
<s> - - In the file- selection box, the File- list doesn't always automatically resize on directory changes.  </s>
<s> Does the directory list?  </s>
<s> Maybe they should also have scrollbars?  </s>
<s> I could not reproduce this, but once I only saw the first chars of available filenames.  </s>
<s> The box should also allow files not ending with ".html", may add a "Filter" feature?  </s>
<s> Concerning resizing, well this seems to be a Motif problem :-( !  </s>
<s> Ok for filter, would be nice ...  </s>
<s> - - A document that is a concatenation of HTML documents (i.e. that contains another HTML section after a /HTML tag) ends after the first part.  </s>
<s> This is probably intended, but it would be nice to be able to concatenate a number of WWW- pages into a single file without prior editing, and without losing the notion of different parts, then editing this collection and print it as one piece (with continuous and contiguous page numbering; great for manuals!).  </s>
<s> Also literate programming could be simpler this way.  </s>
<s> We have already do some experiments on breaking a big dodument in small fragments, for exemple when exporting Articles documents in Thot [1] to HTML.  </s>
<s> Splitting is relatively easy if your document has a structure where chunks are clearly designed.  </s>
<s> Problem is having a good merge functionnality.  </s>
<s> It needs helps from the used or a predefined groupping strategy.  </s>
<s> In the case of HTML designing all the pages defining for example a documentation can be tedious for the user and an inadequate auto-fetching strategy could bring you the whole Web in your document and would require a large amount of RAM :-) .  </s>
<s> Best whishes and kind regards, sorry, if I bothered you and there is a mailing list for bugs,  </s>
<s> I have Cc'ed the list, have a look at it.  </s>

<s> The "K" key generates k, K, and Arabic_kaf !  </s>
<s> The "L" key generates l, L, Arabic_lam, and Greek_lamda !  </s>
<s> The "Alt Gr" key generates Mode_switch, and the Mod3 modifier keycode 0x14 = ssharp question backslash keycode 0x22 = Udiaeresis keycode 0x2F = Odiaeresis keycode 0x30 = Adiaeresis keycode 0x26 = A keycode 0x3C = period colon XEmacs, eg. always worked fine for me, treating Udiaeresis like any other "normal" key (like 'A' above, wich is menitioned only uppercase), getting a "udiaeresis" when pressed without the "Shift" key, and a "Udiaeresis" when pressed with "Shift" (to be looked at with "M-x view-lossage").  </s>
<s> When I changed my Xmodmap to have different entries for lower and upper (like the period / colon pair above), I could work with amaya: keycode 0x22 = udiaeresis Udiaeresis keycode 0x2F = odiaeresis Odiaeresis keycode 0x30 = adiaeresis Adiaeresis So my conclusion is that maybe amaya doesn't respect environment variables LC_CTYPE (or LC_ALL, cf. locale(7)), which I have set to iso_8859_1 (I also tried de_DE.ISO8859-1 and ISO-8859-1 (this is the one referenced in the locale(7) man- page)) and regards Udiaeresis not to be a normal character and thus takes it verbatim instead of applying case-conversion according to the "Shift" Key. from isalpha(3): isalpha() checks for an alphabetic character; it is equiva- lent to (isupper(c) || islower(c)).  </s>
<s> The details of what characters belong into which class depend on the current locale.  </s>
<s> For example, isupper() will not recognize an A - umlaut as an uppercase letter in the default C locale.  </s>

<s> Which leads me to another Nice-If-Changed: - - - - Since amaya always needs at least one document to display (I know,  </s>
<s> we already had that one), there could be a nicer way to persistently define a different HOME_PAGE (site- wide and/or on a per- user basis) than editing the amaya- script or setting Emvironment- Variables (name-space-pollution): X resources and config- files like ~/.amaya.  </s>

<s> or even  </s>
<s> amaya /dir/path/myhomepage.html  </s>
<s> You could add an alias in your environment to map the amaya command into one of the above lines.  </s>
