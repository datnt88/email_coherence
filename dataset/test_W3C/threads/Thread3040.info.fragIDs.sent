<s> Read the draft charter published on this list and noticed the following: July 96 Final draft for Secure Transport Layer Protocol "STLP" This date wasn't mentioned in the BOF.  </s>
<s> Doesn't this presume that a Proposed Standard has already come from the working group?  </s>
<s> Barb Fox bfox@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> The *date* was certainly not brought up in the BOF, especially since this is te crucial, debated expectation of "unification by Montreal".  </s>
<s> This was not an oversight, though; the charter discussion explicitly avoided milestone issues that evening.  </s>
<s> Separately, though, I thought I'd note that the WG's 'final draft' is only the beginning of the stdization process.  </s>
<s> Final drafts are submitted to the IESG with a recommendation to Proposed; then a Last Call is held.  </s>
<s> Later, evidence of its success can be brought to the IESG to promote it to STD status.  </s>
<s> Besides, I can think of a pretty cool logo for STP -- STLP can't even be pronounced!  </s>
<s> :-) Rohit Khare  </s>
<s> These are "guess" dates at this point.  </s>
<s> The point is that if we were to get an RFC by the end of the year -- a "final" draft needs to be available soon.  </s>
<s> My guess is that the sooner this get resolved the better -- with the right technical soltion of course.  </s>
<s> We also have enough combined expertise that this is not totally out of the question.  </s>
