<s> Remove the br/ from the h1 as on other levels.  </s>
<s> I don't get the idea of putting the navbar in a map (client side image map).  </s>
<s> What's the point?  </s>
<s> What do you gain?  </s>
<s> Good idea putting the shortcut to the messages in the text.  </s>
<s> The date format was corrected on other pages, but not this one (still mixed-endian).  </s>
<s> I don't see the advantage of the bullets in the navbar.  </s>
<s> The 'title's in the navbar are inconsistent (see previous comments)  </s>
<s> Merge the actions 'mail' 'help' and 'search' into one line.  </s>
<s> You could put a search box inline here.  </s>
<s> Merge the start and end dates onto one line.  </s>

<s> Oops, I switched from a dl list to ul but I forgot to actually switch the enclosing tags!  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Good point, I'll fix it.  </s>
<s> This is for accessibility reason.  </s>

<s> Oops, thanks, fixed.  </s>
<s> They can be removed by a CSS rule.  </s>
<s> I don't see an advantage in them per se, but I wanted to use a list format element instead of a p with br for each entry (cleaner, easier to parse).  </s>
<s> Do you think it shouldn't be so?  </s>
<s> Is that the "Discussion threads" vs "messages by thread" point?  </s>
<s> Good idea, I'll try to see how that looks.  </s>
<s> I don't think I'll add a search box to keep the page short.  </s>
<s> David Booth did the same suggestion, I'll implement it.  </s>
<s> Not sure either.  </s>

<s> Ooh I hadn't spotted this before.  </s>
<s> This is weird tag abuse.  </s>
<s> Can anyone explain to me what the accessibility advantages are of using a client-side image map not as a client-side image map, but as a container for links?  </s>
<s> Why is it better than using a p or a div ?  </s>
<s> Steven Pemberton  </s>
<s> The idea was that large groups of links are hard to navigate through for someone accessing a page serially (e.g., who is using a keyboard to navigate serially through a set of links).  </s>
<s> Rather than ask the author each time to provide an "unsightly" [jump over bunch of links] link, we thought it would be useful for user agents to provide this service.  </s>
<s> But, we needed markup that user agents can rely on as being "markup that identifies a group of links".  </s>
<s> The idea was that MAP is already used to identify a group of links, that happen to have a graphical representation.  </s>
<s> The WAI groups that proposed the change to HTML 4.01 said "Let's use MAP for groups of links even when the representation is non-graphical, as in a group of text links." - Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)  </s>
