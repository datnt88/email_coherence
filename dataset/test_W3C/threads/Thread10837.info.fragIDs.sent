<s> If we finesse the RS/RE using the Durand/Nicol trick (which seems like a pretty trouble-free win), then (and this is a serious question) are there remaining big problems with mixed content?  </s>
<s> Because if not, I'd hate to lose it... it is certainly natural to use in declaring, e.g., paragraphs with references or images or a href="http://www.w3.org/" hyperlinks /a .  </s>

<s> I think that is an excellent idea.  </s>
<s> Your "mixed content" paragraph is easily represented by using explicit sub-paragraph elements (or, as HyTime calls them, "pseudo-elements"), viz: I understand how RS and RE characters can be excluded from XML.  </s>
<s> What I don't understand is whether, under those circumstances the following two cases will cause identical data to be passed to the application.  </s>
<s> If not, what data character codes are passed to the application in each case?  </s>
<s> Case 1:  </s>
<s> Text of p. Case 2: With the "no mixed content" rule, RS and RE could be confined to element content (that is, between elements) where they would always be ignored; they would never occur in data.  </s>

<s> My understanding is that these would return *different* parse results.  </s>
<s> We could (if it is so desired) make it an application convention to strip leading and trailing whitespace.  </s>
<s> Thanks Gavin.  </s>
<s> That's what I feared, so eliminating RE and RS characters doesn't really solve the problem.  </s>
<s> Making it an "application convention" to strip some whitespace just shifts the burden from a few parsers to all applications and increases the chance of inconsistent treatment.  </s>
<s> Better, I think, to eliminate mixed content altogether as James Clark has proposed.  </s>
