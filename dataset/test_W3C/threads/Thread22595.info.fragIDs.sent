<s> Is there a parser-independent way to obtain a DocumentTraversal interface?  </s>
<s> The doc here: shows the following:  </s>
<s> NodeIterator iter = (DocumentTraversal)document).createNodeIterator(  </s>
<s> root, NodeFilter.SHOW_ELEMENT, null); Does this imply that the class implementing the (DOM Level 2) Document is guaranteed to also support DocumentTraversal?  </s>
<s> How else would one get at it otherwise?  </s>
<s> Check hasFeature to find out if the document support the Traversal APIs.  </s>
<s> If  </s>
<s> it does, you should be able to cast the Document into a DocumentTraversal.  </s>
<s> (Details of casting are language-dependent, but should be the same for all implementations that share a single language binding.)  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> But are you saying that this is by convention?  </s>
<s> I can't find anything in the standard that guarantees that such a cast will always work, i.e., the class that implements Document will also implement DocumentTraversal.  </s>
<s> If DOMImplementation.hasFeature says that 'Traversal' is implemented, the cast is guaranteed to work.  </s>
<s> That's the nature of hasFeature.  </s>
