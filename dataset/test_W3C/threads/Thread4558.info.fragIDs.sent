<s> Please let me concentrate on the issue that I think will cause more trouble for the future: relaxing the constraints associated with the document node.  </s>
<s> According to this point I only see backwards compatibility issues, not real requirements (XSLT could very easily enforce that documents nodes have to obey Infoset rules).  </s>
<s> With this respect we are in a dilemma: we are either backwards compatibility with XSLT 1.0 or in compatibility with XML itself and Infoset.  </s>
<s> We did choose XSLT 1.0 and ignored XML itself and Infoset.  </s>
<s> That's a strange choice, with unfortunate long term consequences.  </s>
