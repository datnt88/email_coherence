<s> Are there any issues raised by the use of inline styling rather than using a linked style sheet?  </s>
<s> thanks in advance Julian Scarlett btw I got my knuckles severely rapped for publicly criticising the fact that Sheffield's online voting site was inaccessible.  </s>
<s> This suggest to me that there are people who subscribe to this list who's main agenda is *not* the provision of accessible web pages.  </s>

<s> Linked style sheets are recommended, apparently for reasons of maintenance and consistence: "Use linked style sheets rather than embedded styles, and avoid inline style sheets."  </s>
<s> It's difficult to say what practical _accessibility_ implications this might have.  </s>
<s> Generally, what's simple and logical and consistent tends to be better in the long run in all respects, other things being equal.  </s>
<s> But more  </s>
<s> specifically, isolating all CSS from HTML and gathering all CSS rules to a single file (or a small set of files) makes it much easier to consider whether the stylistic suggestions are suitable for a particular user or environment and to construct another style sheet (modified or completely new) as needed.  </s>
<s> For example, if you use different fonts in a document for different ingredients there, it's easier to consider how a _corresponding_ styling could be done using colors, or voice, or other methods, when you just need to analyze a relatively short CSS file.  </s>
<s> Besides, a linked style sheet can be made optional (or "alternate"), so that the user can switch it off without switching off all CSS.  </s>
<s> In particular, with linked style sheets you could write one CSS file that you would very much like to be applied and another CSS file that is of secondary importance or otherwise more optional.  </s>
