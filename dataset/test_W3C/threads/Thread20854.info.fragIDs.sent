<s> Hi, It seems that there's a curious bug in the win 9X version of Amaya 7.1 when writing an annotation.  </s>
<s> If you start typing text then all is well until the annotation window starts to scroll.  </s>
<s> At this point the cursor jumps to somewhere in the middle of the text that you just entered, and of course the text you're typing is all jumbled up.  </s>
<s> I didn't get this effect in the linux-elf version of Amaya 7.1 that I've also been using.  </s>
<s> Thanks Richard Kaye  </s>
