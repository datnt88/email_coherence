<s> I propose that we replace checkpoint 2.2 with the following: 2.2: [Priority 1] Ensure that content is created in accordance with a published standard.  </s>
<s> This ensures that it is possible to create User Agents which are aware of the standard being used, and relevant accessibility features.  </s>
<s> For example, produce content whicvh conforms to a W3C specification (see also 2.1).  </s>
<s> (CMN: I think this is sufficiently self-explanatory not to require techniques beyond the example).  </s>
<s> 2.3: [Priority 1] Do not use a document type which precludes users' access to content or function of the document.  </s>
<s> Some document types are inaccessible, and certain modifications to existing types can reduce the accessibility.  </s>
<s> Both of these cases must be avoided.  </s>
<s> (The techniques section for 2.2 applies to this checkpoint)  </s>

<s> My questions: what does "published standard" mean, if anything?; Should such a "standard" be vetted for accessibility?; If one obeys 2.3, does 2.2 matter?  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> A published standard means one that the document type has been published, preferably on the web (should we say this explicitly?) The standard used to comply with 2.2 does not need to be vetted for accessibility to satisfy 2.2 but that is precisely what 2.3 requires, and why the two are different Charles McCN  </s>
