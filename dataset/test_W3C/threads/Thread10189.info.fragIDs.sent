<s> As actioned yesterday I have prepared a new version of this WD for review by next Friday, when, hopefully, we will agree to publish.  </s>
<s> The new copy is dated 26 October and can be found at: For those of you who have already studied the 25 October draft, the following version shows non-trivial differences.  </s>
<s> Please try and avoid confusing these two drafts.  </s>
<s> There is an archive copy (CSS and imgs broken) at: Substantive differences from yesterday are: + the datatype URI component of a literal is optional + the term typed literal and untyped literal are defined and used + the type rdfs:StringLiteral is deleted Other differences are + the untyped literal is suggested as appropriate for "plain text in a natural language" + datatype mappings only use the string, not the langID + rdfs:XMLLiteral is an exception in that it uses the langID + no value is defined for untyped literals (section 4.2.2) + the lexical form is the string not a pair + literals are hence triples (except for untyped ones) Jeremy PS: I think these latest changes are an improvement, not merely an attempt to compromise with Pat.  </s>
<s> The notion of untyped literal is one that RDF users moving from M&amp;S will know, and readers of the primer will use.  </s>
<s> So to have that explicit in the graph is probably appropriate.  </s>
<s> Jeremy-- I'm having trouble parsing the above.  </s>
<s> Which of the above two URLs points to the version we should be looking at as containing the latest stuff?  </s>
<s> And which two drafts are we to avoid confusing, the ones pointed to by the two URLs you've given above, or one of them vs. the 25 October draft?  </s>
