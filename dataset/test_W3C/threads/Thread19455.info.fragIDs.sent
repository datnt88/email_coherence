<s> Hi there, Since Version 1.3a amaya is unable to handle calls to cgi scripts with cmdline args correctly.  </s>
<s> When i try 'amaya http://jusa.telco-tech.de/cgi-bin/LINKS?Development' aamya crashes with '*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***'.  </s>
<s> When i call this by clicking a URL I can see the correct call in the addressline but the script is called without the cmdlineargs.  </s>
<s> I have tried this with the precompiled version on a linux-2.0.34 (lib5) machine and with a handmade version (libc6/lesstif) on a linux-2.0.35 machine privat: g.tenchio(AT)snafu.de  </s>

<s> Hello Gernot, We verified the problem you described using solaris, linux, and windows NT and couldn't reproduce it.  </s>
<s> I have the impression that when you type the command string, your shell is intercepting the ?  </s>
<s> char.  </s>
<s> Try to execute it again enclosing the arguments to amaya inside quotes: amaya "http://your-url?parameters"  </s>
<s> Could you tell me if this works now?  </s>
<s> This doesn't explain the crash you reported.  </s>
<s> If you compiled under debug, could you mail me a stack trace after the crash?  </s>
<s> Thanks for your feedback, -Jose  </s>

<s> Hi, I have tried it with enclosing the arguments and the result is the same like before.  </s>
<s> The problem is it works with amaya 1.2/1.3.  </s>
<s> Only since version 1.3a this error occurs.  </s>
<s> I think it must be an internal error because i can see the complete URL (http://...?whatever) in amaya's adressline.  </s>
<s> When i can find the time to recompile amaya i will send more informations.  </s>
