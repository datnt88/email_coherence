<s> The summary conclusion in the minutes includes the statement that 3.1.1 is too vague to be a technique.  </s>
<s> I do not recall this ever being decided by the group.  </s>
<s> I think that at one  </s>
<s> point it may have been suggested that this was the case by an individual, and it was suggested to me in private converstaion by an individual.  </s>
<s> I do not regard the technique (following the proposed modification which changes the requirement from redundant meansof control to device-independent means of control) as even slightly vague.  </s>
<s> It can be checked explicitly by the following test: For each function provided by the User Agent (changing font, activating a link, selecting text, changing rate of speech, decreasing tolerance of key-bounce, determining how often headers are repeated in linearised tables, etc, as applicable to the User Agent in Question) is it possible for the control to be activated in a device independent manner?  </s>
<s> If there is an API, or a control feature for which the OS always provides alternative access, the answer is yes.  </s>
<s> If there is a hardware-specific mechanism, for which there is no API, the answer is no.  </s>
<s> It is a wide-reaching guideline, which is very important to ensure accessibility of a User Agent.  </s>
<s> It probably should be modified to take account of whether the User Agent makes an API available or whether it is constrained to certain hardware.  </s>
<s> But then, a touch screen information kiosk, with no voice output or tactile feedback, is not accessible.  </s>
<s> Which is not the same thing as saying that it cannot serve a need, merely that in nearly all circumstances it is not a total solution to that need.  </s>

<s> I was basing my statements on the revsed wording which I proposed - device independent control mechanism, rather than redundant means, since I don't see that there is a need for much redundancy, which simply adds bloat to the progams.  </s>
<s> This would mean that you don't need any of the things Jon listed, you simply need some kind of API (or to take advantage of one that the OS can be relied on to have provided already) which allows access to the controls.  </s>
<s> A simple solution would be a menu somewhere which gave access to each command/function which could be carried out by the UA, and to which there was some reconfigurable access mechanism.  </s>
<s> Such a menu used to be part of MS Word - I think it was a precursor to the process of customising toolbars.  </s>
<s> But most functions (mouse-based ones may be more difficult) can be readily provided in this way, and the problem is solved.  </s>
<s> The makers of a single switch interface can then provide, using whatever User Interface they see fit, access to the functions of this browser by means of that interface.  </s>

<s> That is the fundamental and fatal flaw in your reasoning: you are proposing to substitute apples for oranges.  </s>
<s> A programming interface is not a user interface.  </s>
<s> Device-independent user access to control capabilities, including meta-control capabilities such as profiling the user interface, is an oxymoron.  </s>
<s> You can't give the user access to a verb without an interface device.  </s>
<s> A given software product will support some user interface profiles natively and be adaptable to support other user interface profiles.  </s>
<s> Only in the case where "adaptable to support" capability is claimed does the inteface to the rest of the UA matter.  </s>
<s> But in the case of UI profiles supported "by adaptability" the adaptive add-on forms part of the UA and we have certainly violated the "please, no assembly required" request.  </s>
<s> The rest of the UA, supplied by the add-on, accesses devices to communicate with the user.  </s>
<s> The requirement to support diverse devices for each verb is the fundamental requirement, and it can only be verified in terms of the actual devices accessed by the UA including the add-on components.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> I agree in theory that navigation and interaction of the HTML document area is part of the user interface.  </s>
<s> Given the section that it is in and the discussion around 3.1.1, it was intended to refer to menus and toolbars (i.e. the browser container's UI).  </s>
<s> HTML document and the container UI are two distinctly different things and we have guidelines that deal specifically with navigation and interaction with the HTML document between section 4 and 5. Let's keep 3.1.1  </s>
<s> strictly to the container UI and have the rest of the guidelines to the document area as it was intended.  </s>
