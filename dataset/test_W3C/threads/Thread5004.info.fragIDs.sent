<s> == Task A support engineer wants to find the telephone number of a person called "Fred Bloggs", a person he has not spoken to before but one of his workgroup colleagues has.  </s>
<s> The information may be one of several databases (information may be quite new, a workgroup may have different databases for different support situations for historical reasons).  </s>
<s> The support engineer has a phone number look facility on his PDA.  </s>
<s> This software knows the query needed based on FOAF but needs to be told where to ask the query.  </s>
<s> == Importance of DAWG In order to ask the same query of different databases, the software tool needs to know what protocol to use.  </s>
<s> The DAWG recommendation provides a common way of doing this so the software tool does not need to do anything different except change the destination of the query.  </s>
<s> End-users benefit in seamless access to a wider variety of data sources.  </s>
<s> Application providers benefit from wider access to different kinds of data sources without needing to provide specific software; similarly for server software providers.  </s>
<s> == Other This is a common access protocol use case.  </s>
<s> By having one common protocol, the same client-side software can be used with different datasources even if the software was written independently of the database interface.  </s>
<s> It does not matter which implementation of a web-based interface is used.  </s>
<s> The protocol should use already deployed technology (SOAP and/or HTTP) to reduce the deployment burden.  </s>
<s> The DAWG rec.  </s>
<s> need only describe how to package the query and the details of the result.  </s>
<s> The ability to execute queries from a small device suggests a lightweight usage of HTTP or SOAP, or at least a lightweight subset.  </s>
<s> It is possible that the DAWG-QL will not cover all possible situations.  </s>
<s> The protocol could be used to carry other queries, in specialised query languages, in the same general framework.  </s>
<s> I like the gist of this use case.  </s>
<s> A possible variant could also address distributed/federated query, where the query broker simply maintains a set of URIs denoting DAWG compliant portals, and addition of new sources is done simply by adding to that set of URIs.  </s>

<s> Patrick Stickler Nokia, Finland patrick.stickler@nokia.com  </s>
<s> It would be good to keep this base case simple (one device, contacting several places) and creating a separate distributed/federated query use case as an extension of this even if it is the query broker style you describe.  </s>
<s> This keeps the use cases clear - it seems to me that adding too many ifs/buts to a use case means distracting from agreeing the core.  </s>
