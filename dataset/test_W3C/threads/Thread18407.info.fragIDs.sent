<s> If I can't see colors or distinguish them easily, I need something else to determine that this element is different from the elements that are around it.  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> Some people only see in black and white (using the rods of their retina) so different shades of gray are hard to distinguish.  </s>
<s> So having a highlight not dependent on color or sahdes of gray is important to some disabilities to easily recognize highlighting and important element on a page.  </s>
<s> In issue 484 [1], we resolved that greys count as colors.  </s>
<s> This leaves black and white.  </s>
<s> If the highlight mechanism relies on color, and the user can select color preferences, then no system in the world would let you choose any color except white and black.  </s>
<s> So the user can change the highlight colors to black and white if desired.  </s>
<s> This is covered by the user control checkpoint.  </s>
<s> I can't justify *certainly not at a P1 level) why the default styles must not rely on color if the user can change the colors (including black and white).  </s>
<s> I thought maybe it was that some people might not realize that they could change the colors, but we require documentation of such features at P1, so the requirement is at best a P3. And, as I pointed out, this would undoubtedly mean differing from operating environment conventions, which is not a good thing.  </s>
<s> So making this a P1 requirement may interfere with the usability for other users (including users with disabilities, who might, for example, be distracted by lots of icons, boxes, etc.).  </s>
<s> There's no technical reason that makes the default checkpoint hard to implement.  </s>
<s> I'm finding it very hard to justify as a checkpoint.  </s>

<s> In general we use the following hierarchy for our checkpoints: 1. Provide user control 2. Use OS defaults 3. Allow the user to create and use profiles The major problem with 10.3 right now is that the first clause on requiring defaults differing in more than just color is only required if the second clause on using OS settings is not available for the feature.  </s>
<s> In the Mac or Windows environment developers can meet the 10.3 requirement by following OS conventions, rather than meet the first clause requirements.  </s>
<s> What we have been saying in general in the document is to give users control of changing defaults and then ideally have profiles that users can load that are useful for major disability groups.  </s>
