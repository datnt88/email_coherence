<s> Hello, I am having a hard time summarizing our discussion from Monday as a proposal for discussion at the F2F with WCAG and AU. here's what I've got.  </s>
<s> Help?  </s>
<s> The ERT WG has been working on an Evaluation and Repair Language  </s>
<s> (EARL).  </s>
<s> The goals of this language are twofold:  </s>
<s> 1. to be generated by authoring, evaluation, and repair tools to track the accessibility of a page or a site.  </s>
<s> 2. to be shared between authoring, evaluation, and repair tools so as not to replicate work or to build on each other's work.  </s>
<s> Other applications: 1.  </s>
<s> To search for sites that conform to WCAG or that do not have certain accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> 2. To make conformance claims on any set of guidelines (i.e. could use for ATAG or UAAG conformance claims as well).  </s>
<s> More information is available at [1] (thanks to Sean Palmer)  </s>
<s> At Monday's telecon [2], we discussed various claims that someone might make about an attribute or an element on a site or page.  </s>
<s> For example, someone or some tool might say, "image x has an alt attribute.  </s>
<s> the contents of the alt attribute are acceptable."  </s>
<s> Or "image x is missing an alt attribute."  </s>
<s> or "image x does not have a longdesc attribute and needs one" or "image x does not have a longdesc attribute and does not need one." or "the alt-text for image x is ok, but I suggest that you use this text instead."  </s>
<s> Or, "the alt-text for image x is ok, but could be better."  </s>
<s> This lead to a discussion of rating scales.  </s>
<s> For example, one complaint that I have heard from people implementing WCAG 1.0 is: I have followed all of the priority 1 checkpoints and all but 1 of the priority 2 checkpoints yet I can only claim Level A conformance.  </s>
<s> In other words, it is all or nothing.  </s>
<s> Perhaps in WCAG 2.0, using EARL someone could claim they have met Level A as well as checkpoints x, y, z.  </s>
<s> On an individual checkpoint level, there are many subjective checkpoints in WCAG.  </s>
<s> These require a human "rating" of sorts.  </s>
<s> A rating implies that a scale is being used.  </s>
<s> The scales might be: verbosity ("the longdesc needs more detail"), appropriateness ("this alt-text is not equivalent"), simplicity ("the language is too difficult"), etc.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should associate a scale and a test procedure that someone can follow to help them determine if they have met each technique/checkpoint?  </s>
<s> (Aside: I still find it very hard to distinguish between checkpoints and techniques - i still think these need to be called like technology-specific checks or something) Previously, people felt that we could use a point system for each checkpoint.  </s>
<s> People would add up their points to determine their level of accessibility.  </s>
<s> This was discounted with the argument that someone could have a high point total but not be accessible.  </s>
<s> What the ERT WG is asking is "can we only answer yes or no or not applicable for a checkpoint?"  </s>
<s> The ERT WG proposes that we discuss conformance issues at the joint meeting between AU WG, WCAG WG, and ERT WG during the afternoon of March 1 rather than AERT open issues.  </s>
<s> If others from the AERT WG would like to help me clarify our questions, I would appreciate it.  </s>
<s> I know we have talked some about ratings and decided not to do that for WCAG, but we are not talking about something a bit different this time.  </s>

<s> I updated the "EDL Overview", so that it is now the "EARL Overview", and the URI has "changed" to:- - EARL Overview The old URI will still point to the EDL overview, but I'll post a note saying that it has been replaced.  </s>
<s> Len, you might want to update the ERT page.  </s>
<s> Wendy: hopefully there are some useful things in there that you could use in the ERT/AU/GL note.  </s>
<s> You should probably change that to "thanks to Len Kasday", or better yet "ERT IG".  </s>

<s> My main thoughts after reading Wendy's summary are that we have the following interactions with AU and GL  </s>
<s> Write GL so that they are machine readable.  </s>
<s> Then an evaluation tool could  </s>
<s> pull in GL and write EARL.  </s>
<s> For example, if GL were in form Element X must/should/may have attribute Y, which a human judges according to the following criteria [pointer to explanation of criteria which is only human readable] (This is like a schema with additional pointers to human-readable criteria) Then a tool would have a general function that checks for the existance of the attribute, presents the human readable criteria, and gives the human user a scale to on which to set a value.  </s>
<s> The tool then exports result as EARL.  </s>
<s> An editing tool would accept this info and integrate it into it's operation.  </s>
<s> With this general scheme you wouldn't need separate hand written code for all the different attributes that fit this scheme, like ALT, SUMMARY, TITLE, etc.  </s>
<s> They would all be treated the same.  </s>
<s> Additional thoughts below.  </s>
<s> See esp.  </s>
<s> I labeled my notes "LRK::" and Wendy's with "WC::" There also references to Seans followup that he wrote under the title "EARL Overview" WC::  </s>
<s> LRK:: This says how it's generated and that it's shared, but we also need to say what it is.  </s>
<s> Here's the summary statement from Sean's overview: "The Evaluation And Repair Language is an RDF based framework for recording, transferring and processing data about automatic and manual evaluations of resources.  </s>
<s> The purpose is to provide a framework for generic evaluation description formats that can be used in generic evaluation and repair tools.  </s>
<s> " Here's what I wrote in the scenarios page [3].  </s>
<s> It's a special case of  </s>

<s> LRK:: I'd second Sean's suggestion to attribute this to the whole ER group  </s>
<s> LRK:: You're right that those are relevant axes along which to evaluate, but for now I'd be inclined to just have a single variable, e.g. "quality" with a free form comment field that the person could use to explain how they got there.  </s>
<s> Although WCAG could provide these sorts of guidance.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.... so WCAG could be written in a machine readable form so that a tool could present the WCAG criteria when the user is performing evaluations that will be recorded in EARL...  </s>
<s> LRK:: If the test procedure has steps, I'd suggest that EARL actually record the result of each step, instead of just the bottom line.  </s>

<s> (and also in the further reading section, which I have yet to update properly).  </s>
<s> BTW, I hacked off the ".html" from the end of the URL.  </s>
<s> The W3C server handles pages without file extensions, which is good for URI persistence: what if in twenty years time we don't use HTML anymore?  </s>
<s> "/earl.html" is going to become redundent, but "/earl" hopefully isn't (of course, EARL may become redundant too, but historically it wont be.  </s>
<s> Really, date stamping it would be best).  </s>

<s> Shouldn't this be happening as we write WCAG 2.0?  </s>
<s> We call for "content" to be indexed/referenceable but are preparing the document as if it were (at least to a certain extent) a printed item rather than itself reflecting what we are calling for.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> The idea of using RDF was that any URI becomes something we can asserrt conformance to.  </s>
<s> The end goal is to look at a lot of RDF about a page and be able to find out that it will be useful to me.  </s>
<s> One way would be to find that it meets WCAG double-A conformabnce requirements.  </s>
<s> Another way would be to know that it meets the particularproblem I have, which is in fact one of the techniques listed ion the AERT.  </s>
<s> Since the AERT techniques have URIs, and will continueto have them, all that needs to be done here is to assert that a particular AERT technique is applied, and then provide a collection of RDF for defining the fact that if some collection of AERT techiques is applied then some WCAG checkpoint has been met.  </s>
