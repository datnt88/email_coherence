<s> Just downloaded the latest Tidy (which we use integrated with Homesite 4.5.1), since the March version we'd been using wasn't downcasing all tags.  </s>
<s> I ran the latest Tidy against a test HTML file I've "tidyed" up before, and I know the original has errors such as empty tags and tables without attributes.  </s>
<s> I receive an error message saying that errors and warnings were found, but the TidyOut log is empty.  </s>
<s> Nada.  </s>

<s> Thank you Terry.  </s>
<s> Nice to know we're not alone.  </s>
<s> Our solution has been to revert to the May 1 2000 version of Tidy (we keep several older versions).  </s>
<s> Can you tell us what we've lost by reverting to this older version?  </s>
<s> I.e., was it really worth the effort to go to the July version?  </s>
<s> TIA.  </s>
