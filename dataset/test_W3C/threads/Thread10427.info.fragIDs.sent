<s> The LC comments period ends on 21/Feb.  </s>
<s> I have an action to put together a schedule for completing the review and processing of last call comments.  </s>
<s> Broadly, I suggest we arrange some extended (2 hr) telecons to process these.  </s>
<s> Would these times work for folks?  </s>
<s> 21 Feb Last call comments deadline 28 Feb Editors agree schedule for considering last call comments Possibly process some 03 Mar Tech Plenary 11 Mar 1100-1300 Boston time Telecon to consider comments 14 Mar 1000-1200 Boston time Telecon to consider comments 18 Mar 1100-1300 Boston time Telecon to consider comments 21 Mar 1000-1200 Boston time Telecon to consider comments 28 Mar Review extent of changes 04 Apr Revised documents, pub ready due.  </s>

<s> I shall be traveloling, and probably unavailable for teleconference, between 16-27 March.  </s>

<s> Thanks for letting me know Graham.  </s>
<s> Looks like we should try to take comments concepts early.  </s>
<s> Will you be able to work on the doc whilst travelling, i.e. if we got most of the concepts doc comments disposed of byt 14/Mar, do you think you could hope to have the concepts doc updated and pub ready by 04 Apr?  </s>

<s> Realistically, probably not *while* I'm travelling, but I'd reckon to put in a concentrated burst of effort soon after returning.  </s>
<s> And I'd hoped to be able to do most of the work beforehand.  </s>
<s> So I'd hope that 4Apr is achievable; I don't seem to be able to master pubrules, so it would probably need someone available to look after that angle.  </s>
<s> I should also be able to deal with point issues while travelling (I just don't expect to have the mental "space" to handle the big picture at that time).  </s>
