<s> a) I created an "output modalities" entry to be parallel to the "input modalities" entry.  </s>
<s> They should be side by side.  </s>

<s> Ian, I like your proposal but it seems open to an enterpritation that speech output may be given the same weight in controll exercise as visual output and there are too few checkpoints to support that view if I understand correctly.  </s>
<s> I tried to rework the proposal to capture this but failed.  </s>
<s> I'll keep trying unless someone comes up with a reason why I should not or one that does.  </s>
<s> Perhaps what is needed is the source made clear.  </s>
<s> speech output might be the result of adding an assistive technology to a system and therefore the pages are spoken.  </s>
<s> I think that "rendered synthesized speech" is different from the output of the application being turned into speech as a result of additional software or hardware or processing.  </s>
