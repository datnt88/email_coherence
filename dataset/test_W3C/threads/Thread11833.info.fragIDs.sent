<s> Folks, please note that this meeting would be on at the same time as the ATIA meeting in Orlando, Florida.  </s>
<s> If the time is impossible for anyone please let us know as soon as possible - at the moment the next closest possible times are a week earlier (which will cut into the time available for last call review) or ten days later (which will possibly push our schedule back further).  </s>

<s> Most important - if you haven't registered yet, don't forget.  </s>
<s> Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people want to eat for lunch.  </s>
<s> The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille.  </s>
<s> Possible substitutions: baked Scrod (fish) chicken caesar salad hommus roll-up sandwich with salad salad with crab cakes churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions I will do this in the following way: If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear.  </s>
<s> It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do.  </s>
<s> The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday.  </s>
<s> No response will not be considered a vote for the default - it will be considered a vote for "whatever gets chosen" Sorry to bore you with administrivia, but I figure that having food that people like helps the meeting go well... cheers Charles McCN --Charles McCathieNevile mailto:charles@w3.org  </s>
