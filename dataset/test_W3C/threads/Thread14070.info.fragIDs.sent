<s> This message is world-public I am wondering whether it is better to define SVG symbols with a desc as child of the symbol, or to have a desc and a use as siblings.  </s>
<s> The benefit of having the desc defined within the symbol is that it reduces teh amount of work required, and provides a simple mechanism to ensure that people can use well--described graphic elements from libraries.  </s>
<s> The benefit  </s>
<s> of having it as a sibling for a use element is that it is easier to write a  </s>
<s> player that does not need to dereference the URI of the use element.  </s>
<s> But it seems like that would only really apply to a generic XML renderer that used a style sheet to render some textual content, and make no use of Xlink.  </s>
<s> Which seems to me like the sort of user agent that is basically broken, and need not be considered a use scenario.  </s>
<s> thoughts?  </s>

<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> I have no idea what you mean by that.  </s>
<s> How can a symbol be used without fetching it?  </s>
<s> Besides, these descriptions would be different.  </s>
<s> One is the description of a symbol; the other is the description of one usage of a symbol.  </s>
<s> The former is possible and desirable, the latter is not a good idea.  </s>

<s> Right, this is roughly in accord with my further thinking.  </s>
<s> Specifically, it makes sense to be able to rely on the description being available with the object that we get from a library.  </s>
<s> This also fits nicely with the Authoring Tool Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Are there widely-used XML tools that have no idea how to use an xlink as transcluded?  </s>
<s> I don't imagine so.  </s>
<s> In which case it is not smart to suggest that people encourage their existence by finding ways to make them work.  </s>
