<s> I've just made a pass through the Primer PR and have discovered a few  </s>
<s> editorial nits that should be corrected:  </s>
<s> * in the TOC, sections 5.1 and 5.2 need to have "Defining" replaced by "Describing" to be consistent with the actual section titles.  </s>
<s> * in Section 2.2, there are two instances of "example.com" that need to  </s>
<s> be changed to "example.org" to be consistent with the overall example  </s>
<s> * in Section 3.3, there's an "is" in the last sentence that should be  </s>
<s> "are".  </s>
<s> * in Section 5.1, Figure 18 is upside down (class MotorVehicle should be at the top, not the bottom).  </s>
<s> This was fixed early last year in response to a comment from PPS, but somehow an earlier version of the figure got loaded into TR space and I missed it.  </s>
<s> This is just a matter of re-uploading the corrected figure.  </s>
<s> * in Section 6.1, just above Example 32, there's a reference to Example 30 that should be a reference to Example 31.  </s>
<s> * in the References, the [LBASE] reference has the right URL but the wrong date (it should cite the 10 October 2003 version).  </s>
<s> How should these changes be handled?  </s>
<s> --Frank [NB: Now that I'm re-reading the Primer with a relatively "fresh" eye, I've found lots of places that could have been written better, but I'm steadfastly refraining from suggesting any further changes.  </s>
<s> Enough already!  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I really think the above fixes should be made.]  </s>
<s> I've just looked through Frank's proposed changes w.r.t. [1] and agree that  </s>
<s> they are (a) editorial, and (b) desirable.  </s>
<s> (With a clarification about fig  </s>
<s> 18.) [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-primer-20031010/  </s>
<s> Agree.  </s>
<s> I only saw one, but I agree that .org would be more consistent.  </s>
<s> It's not clear to me which way this should be, but I agree it's minor editorial.  </s>
<s> Then the arrows should point upwards?  </s>
<s> Then I agree this is just editorial.  </s>
<s> Agree.  </s>
<s> Agree. #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Hi Frank, I hope its not too late to wish you a Happy New Year.  </s>
<s> It would only be too late if it were this coming December 31.  </s>
<s> As it is, I have your good wishes (thanks!) for the rest of the year (too late for the part of January that's gone by already though; I've got tendonitis from shoveling snow!).  </s>
<s> BTW: Happy New Year all!  </s>
<s> These all look like straightforward typo fixes to me.  </s>
<s> I suggest: - prepare a corrected version of the document - we run a diff to check whats changed - As these are just typos, I'll review them - we can take a formal decision to approve the changes at this weeks telecon - and offer them to the director for publication as a rec  </s>
<s> OK. I should have the corrections uploaded sometime Tuesday (there'll be a new file for the corrected figure as well).  </s>
<s> DanC - that work for you?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Graham-- Thanks for the review.  </s>
<s> Some comments below.  </s>
<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> There are really two, but they're hard to find (which is why I'm having to correct them now!)  </s>
<s> Now that you mention it, I think I'm going to leave this the way it is (the *real* problem is my convoluted sentence structure, but I'm going to leave *that* alone!)  </s>
<s> Yes, the arrows should point upwards.  </s>
<s> The subClass hierarchy is exactly the same; PPS's comment was that people are used to class diagrams having the more general classes at the top.  </s>
<s> The corrected version of the Primer PR is now available off the "editor's draft" link on the WG home page.  </s>
<s> All I've done is make the set of changes I noted in my earlier message (less the change in Section 3.3 I decided was unnecessary after reading Graham's comments); I didn't add bullets for these changes to the Changes Appendix, change the title to an Editor's Draft, etc.  </s>
<s> Also please note that there are two files involved: the main .html  </s>
<s> file, and a new file vehicleClassesJan12.png representing the updated figure (the old file was fig17dec16.png).  </s>
