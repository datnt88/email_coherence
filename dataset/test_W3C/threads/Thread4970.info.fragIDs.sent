<s> This has been a perennial thorn in the side of SQL standardizers.  </s>
<s> If you have a binary representation for some data type (e.g., "integer"), and that representation has a specific, fixed number of bits (e.g., 32), then the range of values available for sites of that type is -(2^32) .. +(2^32)-1.  </s>
<s> Consider a 16-bit integer (just to make the numbers more manageable).  </s>
<s> The range of values is -32,678 .. +32767 (if the integer is signed, of course; if it is unsigned, then the range is 0 .. 65,535).  </s>
<s> Therefore, for *fixed-length binary representations*, under 2s-complement arithmetic/notation, the magnitude of the largest positive value is less than the absolute magnitude of the smallest negative value.  </s>
<s> (Actually, your quote suggests that the Oracle comment said that the magnitude of negative values is smaller than the magnitude of positive values; if that's what we said, then it was a typographical error.) On the other hand, if a decimal notation is used, the magnitudes of the largest positive value and the smallest negative value are identical (for example, a 5-digit decimal type would support values ranging from -99,999 .. +99,999).  </s>
<s> The same is true of binary 1s-complement arithmetic/notation, where the range of a 16-bit type is -32,767 .. +32,767 (but the cost here is that you get 2 zeros: +0 and -0).  </s>
<s> I know of no current commercial hardware that uses 1s-complement notation for binary representations.  </s>
<s> I know of only a few hardware decimal representation implementations, but they are commerically important ones.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Jim  </s>
