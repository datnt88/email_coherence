<s> It's good to see that this has found it's way to this list.  </s>
<s> Some comments: - There is some confusion about MIME.  </s>
<s> All six proposed encodings are listed as 'MIME charsets', but it says that only two of them are suitable for use in MIME.  </s>
<s> Also, while I don't know all the details of the proposed encodings, the base encodings EUC-JP and Shift_JIS are definitely suitable for use with MIME, and it would surprise me if the new, related encodings were not.  </s>
<s> - I agree with MURATA Makoto that some comment on how/when the encodings should be used (or not) are appropriate.  </s>
<s> However, simply labeling them as legacy encodings may be highly confusing.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, saying something like 'ISO-2022-JP-3 is the encoding for Japanese text' is definitely also confusing.  </s>
<s> - The draft does not give very many details about the actual encodings.  </s>
<s> The draft should be expanded to contain enough details so that implementers not able to understand Japanese can implement the encodings.  </s>
<s> - It may be very helpful for a wide audience to include some other details about JIS X 0213 in the draft.  </s>
<s> As I haven't see the final version of JIS X 0213, I cannot give further details at the moment.  </s>
<s> - As JIS X 0213 is not yet published, I think the registration should wait until that has happened, and people have had a chance to have a look at it.  </s>
<s> Of course, that doesn't preclude to continue to prepare the registration as much as possible.  </s>

<s> Martin; This is a formal answer from the JCS committee.  </s>
<s> First of all, the Internet Draft is intended to be published as an Informational, NOT Standard Track, RFC containing opinions of JCS, not IETF.  </s>
<s> Your comments on the content of the Internet Draft should better be sent to Authors or JCS mailing list, not IETF.  </s>
<s> Answers to your comments on procedures or formalities follows.  </s>
<s> A requirement for the registration is "publish".  </s>
<s> There is no requirement that the publication must be in English.  </s>
<s> However, we are kind enough to prepare an RFC-to-be Internet Draft in English.  </s>
<s> All the information is contained in publicly available draft in the home page of JCS referenced in the Internet Draft.  </s>
<s> We are at the final stage of the standardization that there is no change between the published draft in our home page and the paper publication except for bug fixes.  </s>
<s> The draft is already published through WWW, as you know and as is written in our Internet Draft.  </s>
<s> The publication is to solicite public comments and is detailed one.  </s>
<s> You can argue that RFC publication by FTP or WWW is not publication.  </s>
<s> However, we should thank you and other people sending us comments on the detailed draft by having a chance to have a look at it.  </s>
<s> Masataka Ohta  </s>
<s> Well, I already sent them to you.  </s>
<s> I have included the two other authors of the internet-draft.  </s>
<s> I hope this helps.  </s>
<s> I am copying the ietf-charsets list according to Section 4.1 of rfc2278.html.  </s>
<s> I apreciate your kindness.  </s>
<s> There is indeed no requirement, not even for an informational RFC.  </s>
<s> However, as you are planning to publish an informational RFC, I thought it would be a good idea to give some more details.  </s>
<s> I personally don't care, because I can read Japanese, but I think a lot of people would apreciate it, and it would greatly help the adoption and uniform implementation of the new standard and the new 'charset's.  </s>
<s> This would be in the tradition of RFC 1468 and RFC 1554 and others.  </s>
<s> While the first public review page at of pointers, on the final public review page to submissions to the ISO registry and to ISO/Unicode.  </s>
<s> Can you give me a pointer to the actual draft?  </s>
<s> And can you update the pointer in the internet-draft to make things easier to find?  </s>
<s> I wouldn't dream to do so.  </s>
<s> W3C only publishes via the WWW, so I have no problem with a publication on the WWW, as far as I can find it.  </s>

<s> I don't know what UTC means but I'm sure that it has nothing to do with the publication of JIS X 0213.  </s>
<s> The I-D contains information on the current situation.  </s>
<s> They should learn to use plain text.  </s>
