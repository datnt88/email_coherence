<s> Hello, At the face to face meeting I took an action item to map the checkpoints from WCAG 1.0 to the checkpoints in WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> I used a table to format my results, however if you use tablin to linearize it it should be readable.  </s>
<s> When linearized, the WCAG 2.0 checkpoint is a paragraph followed by a list of WCAG 1.0 checkpoint(s).  </s>
<s> Let me know if there is a better way to do this.  </s>
<s> table version: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/10/checkpoint-mapping.html linearized version: The issues that I identified while doing this exercise: - There are 5 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that do not have a clear home.  </s>
<s> - There are 2 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that were given a home but it's not clear they belong there.  </s>
<s> - Inheriting checkpoints from WCAG 1.0 will be tricky.  </s>
<s> It might be best to only prioritize technology-specifics. - Several WCAG 1.0 checkpoint priorities are under debate, how or will we handle?  </s>
<s> - There are redundancies in WCAG 1.0 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 seems to resolve.  </s>
<s> - Might be some redundancies with WCAG 2.0 checkpoints.  </s>

<s> You'll need to define what it means to be "checked by a tool".  </s>
<s> Although  </s>
<s> it's possible for a tool to determine failure to pass certain checkpoints (e.g. absence of ALT text), it's only rarely possible for any tool to determine, by purely automatic means, that a page passes a checkpoint (e.g. is the ALT text correct?).  </s>
<s> Human judgment is needed in almost all cases.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, a tool can help supply that judgment.  </s>
<s> In other words, for each checkpoint there's the questions: - Can an automatic check produce any true negatives?  </s>
<s> - Will that check show all true negatives?  </s>
<s> - Can an automatic check produce any true positives?  </s>
<s> - Will that check show all true positives?  </s>
<s> - Is there any tool that can aid human judgment when human judgement is needed?  </s>
<s> And how much help does it give?  </s>
<s> (This is a - - subjective but important consideration).  </s>
<s> You'll need to decide what "can be checked by a tool" means.  </s>

<s> I looked at Wendy's mapping [1].  </s>
<s> It is a good job of comparing WCAG 1.0 with 2.0.  </s>
<s> However, tools generally check things that are technology specific, so I propose to be more productive that we start with the technology specific checklists and identify those that can be checked [or are actually implemented] by a tool.  </s>
<s> This could be done by mapping ATAG and ERT [5] against the technology specific checklists[2].  </s>
<s> The problem with [2] is that I don't think it is complete enough yet to do the mapping.  </s>
<s> Perhaps more useful would be to take the new TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES [3] and map them to the 1.0 vs 2.0 mapping, then add the mapping of ERT and ATAG tool/machine checks.  </s>
<s> The new gateway techniques document [4] does the mapping already to 1.0, but what I haven't seen yet is the mapping to the proposed 2.0.  </s>
<s> Wendy, could you add to your mapping document [1] three columns "CORE, HTML, CSS" that come from [3] and [4]?  </s>
<s> This may end up being a WIDE table, but the analysis will be useful.  </s>
<s> Look what Wendy found just mapping 1.0 to 2.0 (See [1]).  </s>

<s> I think we need to focus on "what checks" a tool can make, not "which checkpoints" can by checked by a tool.  </s>
<s> The problem with the latter being explained by Len.  </s>
<s> I see this task as simply mapping the existing documented checks in ERT to the 1.0 vs 2.0 mapping, or as I proposed in a separate note, a technology specific checklist that maps to 1.0 vs 2.0.  </s>
