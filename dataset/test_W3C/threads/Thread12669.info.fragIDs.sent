<s> This is a finished paper for HFWeb (Human Factors Web) conference.  </s>
<s> Based on the comments we got from this group on the SVG accessibility note, we tried to come up with some text that is a bit friendlier and more general than the SVG accessibility note.  </s>
<s> So we came up with some design heuristics for multimedia and graphic languages based on the experience gained when writing Accessibility Notes for SVG and SMIL, and also the XML Accessibility guidelines.  </s>
<s> While the paper for the conference is finished we can still develop the heuristics and the presentation.  </s>
<s> So we would be interested in feedback on how well this kind of form brings the message and if it should be integrated to some of the Accessibility Notes.  </s>

<s> This will save users efforts and benefit those who rely on concrete realisations, (like me).  </s>
<s> I am not aware of the use of sound effects on the web, traffic, ice cream vendors, street musicians etc, beatnik seems to be an attempt to meet this need, perhaps we need to include some reference to this.  </s>
<s> Do current screen readers use 'standard' sound effects?  </s>
<s> Peepo will certainly be using them in the near future, as they provide very powerful cues to spatial memory, cf that dredful restart tune.  </s>

<s> Your notes do give links, but could they be in the body?  </s>
<s> ps could not be found.  </s>
<s> I am having trouble with BT cache that is being updated and causing endless problems, so this could be local.  </s>

<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> The HFWeb conference had a certain format they wanted and that's why there are no links in the body.  </s>
<s> I could add them to this web version when I have time.  </s>
<s> I could not find it either any more - the link just goes to the main page.  </s>
<s> Changing URI's is problematic.  </s>
<s> Marja  </s>
<s> Marja I just noticed one thing which is that the link to the "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" document in your references section is really old -- it should be to which will roll it forward to the latest version.  </s>

<s> Jonathan, thanks for these points - they are all good ones.  </s>
<s> In this case we have concentrated mostly on visual media, but the thoughts about sound effects are well taken, and I will bear them in mind for future work.  </s>
