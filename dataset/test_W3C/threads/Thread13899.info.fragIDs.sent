<s> Someone mentioning EARL prompts me to post this ... In the course of developing Site Valet Enterprise Edition 2.0, I've integrated a full accessibility audit trail.  </s>
<s> Pages will be  </s>
<s> assessed by an automatic agent, and may (or must, according to local policy) then be reassessed by a human.  </s>
<s> For the AccessValet desktop tool, it is sufficient to generate a result (Pass/Fail/Unknown/unchecked) and a separate conclusion.  </s>
<s> But for the sitewide database and audit trail, what is required is a single-word status to appear in query results, etc.  </s>
<s> I'm  </s>

<s> * Review No conclusion has been reached and the page should be reviewed.  </s>
<s> * Repair The page has been reviewed and repairs have been identified.  </s>
<s> A much more positive thing than "Fail" to say to users!  </s>
<s> These are supported by more detailed reports equivalent to the  </s>

<s> I'd do this differently.  </s>
<s> The idea is that you make a property called nick:accept - it is generally a subclass of earl:fail, because the implied result is that the checkpoint has not been met, but in your reporting you treat it as you treat an earl:pass.  </s>
<s> This leaves you with earl:cannotTell for your proposed Review, and earl:fail for your proposed repair property.  </s>
<s> And declaring the schema like that means that your results are readily interoperable with others - nick:acceptIt might be considered fine in the reporting logic for some checkpoints.  </s>
<s> This strikes me as similar to Hixie's desire to subclass fail according to whether it was a recorded bug that caused the problem, or consequent on something else, or a catastrophic failure, etc... my 2 bits Chaals  </s>

<s> how would you then really describe a pass or fail (by manual review) after an initial cannotTell returned by a tool?  </s>
<s> The tool reports a cannotTell, mode automatic.  </s>
<s> The person reports a pass (or fail), mode manual.  </s>
<s> You can select based on the mode (if you generally trust people over tools) or you can select based on a particular assertor if you have more detailed information.  </s>
<s> For example, my WCAG evaluating tool requires a person to test something and make an assertion.  </s>
<s> It will soon (I hope :-) put its results onto an annotea system, as will other automatic tests.  </s>
<s> What to do with apparently conflicting results is a big question anyway.  </s>
<s> What if a tool is certain about but something, but a smart person says tehy cannot tell?  </s>
<s> Normally I know which I would trust, but knowing who said what is important for me... cheers Chaals  </s>
