<s> Can we use XML for moving binary data (not text) from one system to another.  </s>
<s> An example of this would be a company merging with another company and both  </s>
<s> organizations utilize COLD-ERM technology If both companies utilize different COLD-ERM vendors, it isn't easy to  </s>

<s> As a result, we are developing a new TIFF  </s>
<s> style transport method to move the data between the systems as an AIIM/ANSI  </s>
<s> standard.  </s>
<s> Several of us on the AIIM/ANSI committee have the following question we are  </s>
<s> hoping someone in SWAP can answer: The question is: We know that we can use TIFF, but can we use XML instead?  </s>
<s> The twist is  </s>
<s> that COLD-ERM data usually is based on AFP metacode, etc. and can include  </s>
<s> graphics as a template.  </s>
<s> As we understand XML, it doesn't support non-ascii  </s>
<s> formats which would prevent us from using XML.  </s>
<s> Is this a correct statement  </s>
<s> or can XML support our needs as well????? Thanks for anyone's input/feedback on this question.  </s>

<s> I am supposing anything you can send over email can work with this using uuencode.  </s>
<s> One of the techniques we use sometimes in the Endeavors project is to just to RMI serialize a Java object that was dyanmically built up from a set of data values, pass it as a bit bucket using a POST method, and then catching it on the HTTP server side using a Java servlet to decode and initiate/load/execute/fetch data and code as appropriate.  </s>
<s> It's one way to do mobile workflows, although we tend to prefer non-binary dependencies/designs. Java turns out to be a great mechanism for mixing and matching, even graphic and data formats as you seem to be doing.  </s>

<s> You absolutely can move binary data within an XML document; but you must encode it into text format so that there are no illegal characters within your data.  </s>
<s> There is no recognized standard way to encode/decode your data, so you decide how to encode and decode your own data.  </s>
<s> Suggested way is probably MIME/base 64 encoding.  </s>
