<s> Hi, I've worked with JADE (the FIPA compliant agent platform) for a while and tried to build agents that offer semantic services (similar to OWL-S) to a broker.  </s>
<s> At some point I faced serious problems with getting my work integrated with the BDI model underlying the FIPA speech acts.  </s>
<s> I therefore decided to use Web Services instead, as some other people I know did.  </s>
<s> Anyway, the only thing I can contribute is a rather long mailing list thread at the JADE list from where you might get some views: Best regards Juergen Zimmer  </s>
