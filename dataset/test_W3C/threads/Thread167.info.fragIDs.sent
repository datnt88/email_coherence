<s> I've tried to download HTML tidy from Ragget's page but nothing happens when I click on the apparent link to do so.  </s>
<s> Though you didn't mention which platform of Tidy you're looking for, I'm guessing Win32 since your X-Mailer seems to point to Outlook ;). Anyhow, if that's the case, your download link would be (http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy.exe), which I just copy-n-pasted from Tidy's webpage.  </s>
<s> And, I just tried that link, and it worked for me :).  </s>
<s> If things still don't work for you, it could be some hiccup in between you and Tidy's server; to check for that, you could try Tracert.  </s>

<s> Tidy can be used with a variety of character encodings, and Rick Jeliffe has done the most work on this.  </s>
<s> You can localize Tidy's messages (see localize.c) and perhaps also the character encoding by modifying the source code.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the easiest thing is to convert your files to UTF8 and pipe them through Tidy and then convert back to the character encoding of your choice.  </s>
