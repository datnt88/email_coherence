<s> I'm curious about the use of tabs instead of spaces for indenting.  </s>
<s> I have always liked tabs (maily because of display in my editors).  </s>
<s> The tidy web page says "Tidy never outputs tabs".  </s>
<s> Is there a particular reason for this or just an option not implemented?  </s>

<s> The number of columns for each tab stop varies from one system or program to another, Unix systems generally use 8, but other systems often use 4 or 5 columns.  </s>
<s> Many people like to use a smaller number of spaces, to maximize the space remaining before the right margin.  </s>
<s> In principle, an option could be added to use tabs, but this isn't a frequently requested option.  </s>

<s> I also prefer tabs over multiple spaces.  </s>
<s> Moreover, I run an "extended find and replace" to replace double spaces with single spaces over all HTML documents that I receive to edit from other authors (this is done recursively until no more matches occur).  </s>

<s> Michael's - are two requests enough for getting this implemented?  </s>

<s> I prefer tabs also.  </s>
<s> I can easily (re-) define the number of spaces these are expanded to on my favourite text editor (BBEdit on the Macintosh).  </s>
<s> It also makes for smaller files, particularly if there is a lot of indenting.  </s>
<s> And we are always being told to minimise the file size to speed downloading :-)  </s>

<s> HTTP compression handles multiple spaces pretty well from what I hear.  </s>
<s> I used to be a big tab user, but I've changed over to using spaces exclusively, and really like the consistency in appearance no matter which editor I'm using or what the tab settings are.  </s>

<s> If this is going to be implemented, my vote would be to make it an option.  </s>
<s> I like to use an editor that does not accept tabs at all, and treats the Tab key as a signal to insert a given number of spaces.  </s>
<s> It would just ignore any tabs in pretty-print output.  </s>

<s> I absolutely agree - a possible solution would be to extend the "indent-spaces" configuration directive to accept not only numbers as values but also boolean or string values: examples: indent-spaces: 4 indent-spaces: no // maybe too confusing?  </s>
<s> indent-spaces: tab I would never vote for replacing a good thing with another good thing, but rather allow the choice between both of them... Sebastian  </s>
