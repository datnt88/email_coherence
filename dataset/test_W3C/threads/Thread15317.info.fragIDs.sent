<s> Couple of problems in the way we were thinking of doing 4.1 Problem 1: If we create a list of things to review against and put it into normative section, then we cannot add to the list.  </s>
<s> So are we saying that those things are the ONLY things that make content simpler to understand-and that they do not need to consider anything else?  </s>
<s> We can't sat etc. on the list to indicate that there may be more because then the success criteria stops being testable (since we are requiring that they review against a list that we don't provide them all of.  </s>
<s> Problem 2: In trying to create a list of individual items, I kept running into the problem that they looked like success criteria.  </s>
<s> Even if we start off with a sentence which simply says, "You must think about the following things," if the list that follows reads like: * One idea per sentence * Words are familiar to intended audience  </s>
<s> * Etc.  </s>
<s> The items end up looking not like suggestions, but success criteria.  </s>
<s> I tried rewording them as questions, but they, again, ended up looking like success criteria.  </s>
<s> * Is there only one idea per paragraph?  </s>
<s> * Are the words and structures familiar to the intended audience?  </s>
<s> * Etc.  </s>
<s> If we release a set of guidelines in this form with a bulleted list of items in the "success criteria" area, I'm afraid it will be widely misunderstood and misconstrued to be a list of criteria.  </s>
<s> I would be willing to bet anybody a very large amount of money that we will immediately see test tools which try to (if they possibly could) test compliance by testing each of these questions rather than testing the "did you do a review".  </s>
<s> The only thing I can think we might do about this is to go back to the original plan which simply had the requirement for review up above and sample lists of things to review below.  </s>
<s> Or maybe make them very clearly general things to be looked at and not specific things to be achieved.  </s>
<s> Not sure how to do that.  </s>

<s> Proposed solution: require that the review be conducted against the  </s>
<s> items on the list.  </s>
<s> That is, if a developer has reviewed the content taking into account the listed items, this should be sufficient for purposes of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The developer should not thereby be precluded from taking into account other considerations, but what we would be saying, in effect, is that if the listed matters have been duly considered then a review has been conducted satisfactorily for purposes of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The working group should strive to ensure that the list includes all of the items considered to be of greatest importance.  </s>
<s> In practice I think the  list compiled for checkpoint 4.1 is rather good, thanks to the  excellent work undertaken by Lisa, Avi and others.  </s>
<s> I agree this could happen, with a high degree of probability.  </s>
<s> I don't like this alternative because the items to be considered can  </s>
<s> Possibly.  </s>
<s> Here are a few options.  </s>
<s> They both run along the line of taking the first of the potential misinterpretations mentioned by Gregg (above) as the lesser of the two evils.  </s>
<s> 1. Rephrase the items to be considered so they read differently from our success criteria: There should be only one idea per paragraph, where possible.  </s>
<s> Words should be used with which the intended audience is expected to be familiar.  </s>
<s> (others can probably write the above better than I just did).  </s>
<s> 2. Use a different style (font, layout etc.) for the "items to be considered", in order to distinguish them from the success criteria (this could also be reflected in the markup).  </s>
<s> 3. Make an explicit statement somewhere in the guidelines that warns against this particular misinterpretation by reminding readers that the requirement is that a review be conducted and it is acknowledged that the items to be taken into account aren't inthemselves testable.  </s>
<s> My current thinking, as indicated, is that the misconstrual of these items as success criteria is less of a practical problem than the risk of their being overlooked, which is the likely result of moving them into a separate section below the success criteria.  </s>
<s> Essentially we have to decide which potential misinterpretation or misapplication is worse, and do our best to militate against it.  </s>
<s> I can say with high confidence that, however they may be written, the guidelines will be misinterpreted and misapplied by people who don't understand them or who implement them carelessly.  </s>
<s> A quick clarification to my previous message to correct a poorly written sentence: I think we should decide which of the two potential misinterpretations Gregg identified is worse, write the guidelines in such a way as to avoid this misinterpretation while still allowing the other, then do our best to militate against the latter misinterpretation so far as possible.  </s>
<s> Of course if someone contrives a proposal that avoids both misinterpretations/misapplications of the guidelines we should accept it.  </s>
<s> My opinion at present is that I would rather include the "items to be considered" in reviews directly under the review requirements themselves, in the success criteria, rather than in separate "additional ideas" sections.  </s>
<s> This doesn't change the substance of the review requirements: the ultimate test is still whether a review was conducted.  </s>
<s> Rather it simply inserts the list of desiderata directly into the text of the success criteria that establish the requirements for a review.  </s>
<s> I was just thinking if we might go with a generalization instead of specifics for the success criteria and then put the specifics in the normative.  </s>
<s> Example: Level 1: SC: Write clearly and simply.  </s>
<s> Normative: 1) One thought per sentence.  </s>
<s> 2) One thought per paragraph.  </s>
<s> 3) No double-negatives.  </s>
<s> We might be able to apply this concept and it still be testable.  </s>
<s> Just my two-cents.  </s>
