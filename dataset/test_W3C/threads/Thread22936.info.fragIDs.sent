<s> I am not really sure if this falls in the DOM area, so apologies in advance, just in case this is off-topic.  </s>
<s> The early versions of Netscape added the "alert()" (and similar) methods to the build-in JavaScript functions.  </s>
<s> After +/- 5 years, this is still the only  </s>
<s> cross-browser (DOM0?) method of displaying dialogs.  </s>
<s> All graphical platforms I know of support the notion of "modal" and "modeless" dialogs.  </s>
<s> The serialization format for these "forms" would of course be HTML.  </s>
<s> Are there any plans for incorporating functionality like this in to a future  </s>

<s> future  </s>
<s> I don't think there are any plans.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, it isn't something we've looked at in detail.  </s>
<s> Alerts seem to be part of the information/decoration surrounding a presentation of the document (which I believe some folks have referred to as the tool's "chrome"), rather than part of the document per se.  </s>
<s> So personally I'm inclined to consider them out of the scope of the Document Object Model and refer this question to another committee.  </s>
<s> But it's possible that the Views And Formatting editorial team might want to make this part of their work; that's the portion of the DOM which comes closest to discussing rendering and presentation.  </s>

<s> The dialog could be seen as just another document.  </s>
<s> The relevant methods (something like "showDialog(...)" and a way to return, say, a ECMAScript object as a result from the dialog) just provide a very thin connection between the two documents.  </s>
<s> I see that functionality like this is on the border of the DOM.  </s>
<s> But as it is, none of the current w3 groups will take it, while there is a great potentian for improvement of functionality.  </s>
