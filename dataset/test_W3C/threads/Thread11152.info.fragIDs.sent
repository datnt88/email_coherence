<s> [... suggestion for XML catalogs ...] I support the _idea_ of this proposal, because it gives an impetus to creating a managed namespace.  </s>
<s> Sometimes such namespaces can be cheap to create and it simply needs some-body to make a proposal which is sufficiently convincing, and suffiently simple to implement that everyone sees the value and adopts it.  </s>
<s> (IMO MIME has some of these features though it also has design flaws.) At present the most obvious namespace management available to everyone is DNS. (For example, in 'Java in a Nutshell', p 19, O'Reilly show how it can be used to provide a unique namespace for any Java package, e.g: COM.ora.writers.david.widgets.Barchart;  </s>
<s> (The first two components are the domain name in reverse order).  </s>
<s> I am not familiar with the URN process in detail - am I right in assuming that it based on DNS?  </s>
<s> Let's suppose that "-//FOOCORP::FOOAUTH//DOCUMENT sometitle ver1.01//EN" fails to find resolution at the local level.  </s>
<s> Postulate the existence of a server (probably mirrored, but let's stay above that level of detail for the nonce) funded by every organization that wishes to use this mechanism.  </s>
<s> Let's call this server xmlid.net.  </s>
<s> That server does not have a listing for every FPI; all it has is one (and only one) entry for every publisher that has joined the cooperative.  </s>
<s> Jon, could you expand on this word, please?  </s>
<s> If it means 'Those large corporations whose business is publishing information and who are prepared to pay for a maintained site (xmlid.net)  </s>
<s> to be set up'.  </s>
<s> If this is the case then it will lead either to a fragmentation of the community, or to a proliferation of 'xmlid.net's  </s>
<s> (e.g. 'xmlid.net.ac.uk', 'xmlid.bio.net')  </s>
<s> So on that server there is a single lookup table cached in RAM, one line of which consists of FOOCORP::FOOAUTH on one side and foodocs.foo.com on the other.  </s>
<s> This server is going to have to be funded somehow, with a registration process and removal of dead entries.  </s>
<s> Will it, in itself, be able to scale to respond to demand or will there be a DNS-like system of servers?  </s>
<s> Add to the abilities assumed for the XML client under the XML catalog proposal the following: it can query xmlid.net with the string FOOCORP::FOOAUTH and get back foodocs.foo.com; it can then query foodocs.foo.com for its corporate catalog; and it can add that corporate catalog to its own for long enough to resolve the query (or fail, but that's entirely FooCorp's responsibility).  </s>
<s> This isn't enough to build a resolution mechanism, but it's enough to think that building one might be possible.  </s>
<s> Is there anything basically wrong with the idea?  </s>
<s> It seems to involve a mapping of organisations onto domain names.  </s>
<s> For example SUN:: would map onto sun.com (right?).  </s>
<s> Is SUN:: the only component of SUN or are there also SUNSOFT, SUN_MICROSYSTEMS, etc.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that it is necessary to have a feel for the stability of organisation names before you can get an idea of the work involved.  </s>
<s> If domain names are a useful approach, what about the use of something like: This says, in effect, if your site (or server) has implemented XML then this is reserved request for the XML catalog that relates to XML information on that site/server.  </s>
<s> It's unlikely to clash with existing namespace (apart from people who used XML for something else :-).  </s>
<s> Webmasters could easily implement it, and it should be fairly straightforward to update the local catalog.  </s>

<s> As I understand it, there is no URN process:  </s>
<s> Last, this document intentionally does not address the problem of  </s>
<s> name resolution, other than to recommend that for each naming authority a name translation mechanism exist.  </s>
<s> Naming authorities assign names, while resolvers or location services of some sort assist or provide URN to URL mapping.  </s>
<s> There may be one or many such services for the resources named by a particular naming authority.  </s>
<s> It may also be the case that there are generic ones providing service for many resources of differing naming authorities.  </s>
<s> Some may be authoritative and others not.  </s>
<s> Some may be highly reliable or highly available or highly responsive to updates or highly focussed by other criteria such as subject matter.  </s>
<s> Of course, it is also possible that some naming authorities will also act as resolvers for the resources they have named.  </s>
<s> This document supports and encourages third party and distributed services in this area, and therefore intentionally makes no statements about requirements of URNs or naming authorities on resolvers."  </s>

<s> Yes. See draft-ietf-urn-naptr-01.txt draft-ietf-urn-http-conv-00.txt  </s>
<s> I don't understand the URN proposal completely, but it seems to be attempting vastly more than what we need.  </s>
<s> Let's suppose that "-//FOOCORP::FOOAUTH//DOCUMENT sometitle ver1.01//EN" fails to find resolution at the local level.  </s>
<s> Postulate the existence of a server (probably mirrored, but let's stay above that level of detail for the nonce) funded by every organization that wishes to use this mechanism.  </s>
<s> Let's call this server xmlid.net.  </s>
<s> That server does not have a listing for every FPI; all it has is one (and only one) entry for every publisher that has joined the cooperative.  </s>
<s> I mean what you think, but I don't agree that fragmentation follows.  </s>
<s> Let's postulate the existence of some organization whose function is to provide such a service and make just enough to pay for itself and the salaries of the people it employs.  </s>
<s> Take the net operating cost every year, divide by the number of "publishers", and that's how much you charge each publisher.  </s>
<s> The service provided is pretty simple: maintain one line in a lookup table and respond to HTTP queries giving the left hand side by returning the right hand side.  </s>
<s> This should cost no more to provide than the typical DNS entry.  </s>
<s> (And we might take advantage of the fact that this is not DNS by putting in place review and arbitration procedures that take advantage of what has been learned from the DNS registration experience.) I am quite unqualified to make a detailed proposal on how to set this up, but I believe that something along this line could effectively solve the FPI resolution problem.  </s>
<s> I know that at Sun we are setting up a collaborative authoring system that automatically assigns FPIs to every publication and resolves those FPIs in our distributed publishing system through distributed partial socats which all fall through, in the worst case, to a single socat that we maintain at docs.sun.com (not yet publicly visible, but soon to appear).  </s>
<s> So for our purposes, which I believe are commensurate with the needs of the great majority of publishers, a system that redirected someone trying to resolve an FPI beginning "-//SUN::SUNSOFT//" to docs.sun.com would work just fine.  </s>
