<s> I've got a question to do with preserving the location in a namespace of the root of a baseline.  </s>
<s> Section 12 has the following discussion of subbaselines and components: As a configuration gets large, it is often useful to break it up into a set of smaller configurations that form the logical "components" of that configuration.  </s>
<s> In order to capture the fact that a baseline of a configuration is logically extended by a component configuration baseline, the component configuration baseline is captured as a "subbaseline" of the baseline.  </s>
<s> The root collection of a configuration is unconstrained with respect to its relationship to the root collection of any ofits components.  </s>
<s> In particular, the root collection of a configuration can have a member that is the root collection of one of its components (e.g. configuration /sys/x can have a component /sys/x/foo), can be a member of the root collection of one of its components (e.g. configuration /sys/y/z can have a component /sys/y), or neither (e.g. configuration /sys/x can have a component /comp/bar).  </s>
<s> My understanding of the protocol is that a baseline does not record where in a namespace the root of the baseline should be located.  </s>
<s> The baseline records the versions and relative names of members of the baseline, i.e. it preserves a namespace where the baseline-collection is the root of the namespace.  </s>
<s> I also thought that while a baseline can have subbaselines, this set of baselines does not define where in a namespace each baseline should be placed.  </s>
<s> Given the DAV:baseline-controlled-collection-set property of a workspace, I had assumed that the workspace acted as a namespace that preserved the relative name of the root of each baseline.  </s>
<s> So, for example, to populate a new workspace from a workspace that publishes a set of baselines, the client would issue MKCOL and BASELINE_CONTROL requests to populate the new workspace with baselines chosen from, &amp; as named in, the publishing workspace.  </s>
<s> Have I understood this right?  </s>
<s> Or is there something in the structure of a baseline itself, that preserves the relative name of another baseline?  </s>
<s> I wondered if it was expected that a baseline implementation should  </s>
<s> record a "baseline-binding", where a baseline-binding is a (name, baseline-history) pair.  </s>
<s> The baseline-collection, or any collection which is a member of the baseline-collection, would retain a baseline-binding if at the time the baseline was created the collection had an internal member which was baseline-controlled.  </s>
<s> Then, on BASELINE-CONTROL of a collection in the new workspace from a baseline, the server could restore a subbaseline if the baseline contains a baseline-binding for the baseline-history of the subbaseline.  </s>
<s> The BASELINE-CONTROL method does not include a postcondition for  </s>

<s> Finally, the cases where a subbaseline is located outside of the namespace of the baseline (examples /sys/y/z +/sys/y and /sys/x + /comp/bar from above), would seem to rely on baseline-bindings being preserved in some other baseline (if the intention is to automate this), and being present in the target namespace of the operation.  </s>

<s> I hadn't understood from the spec that the (collection) version-history should imply a baseline, and so had not seen how the version-controlled-binding could behave as a "baseline-binding".  </s>

<s> If there is an association between a baseline-history and a version-history, is it constrained to be 1:1 (i.e. the baseline-history and version-history are two aspects of the same collection - a collection that is both versioned, and the root of a configuration)?  </s>

<s> A collection version history definitely does not imply a baseline.  </s>
<s> But if a server supports both version-controlled collections and baselines, then if a baseline B1 selects collection version CV2 (say with name "x/y" relative to the root of B1), and if CV2 has a version-controlled binding named "z" to the collection version history CVH3, and if B1 has a subbaseline B2, and if the root of B2 is a version of CVH3, then subbaseline B2 will be located at "x/y/z" relative to the root of B1.  </s>
<s> So, is the model that there is an association between a baseline and a version-history, or between a baseline-history and a version-history, or something else?  </s>
<s> There is an association, but it is the: baseline (selects) collection version (has binding to) collection version history (has version) collection version (root of) subbaseline If there is an association between a baseline-history and a version-history, is it constrained to be 1:1 (i.e. the baseline-history and version-history are two aspects of the same collection - a collection that is both versioned, and the root of a configuration)?  </s>

<s> To make this more concrete: let's assume that "some workspace" is /ws/kk, and that /ws/kk/x is under baseline control, and version-controlled configuration associated with /ws/kk/x selects a baseline from the baseline history /repo/bh/8.  </s>

<s> It depends.  </s>
<s> Let /repo/vh/12 be the version-history that is identified by the version-controlled binding named "y" in the version of /x selected by /repo/bl/22.  </s>
<s> If before the MERGE, there was a VCR that selected a version of /repo/vh/12, then /ws/kk/x/y is just a binding to that VCR.  </s>
<s> If there was no such VCR, then the server creates a new VCR at /ws/kk/x/y.  </s>
<s> If so, which version should it select?  </s>

<s> Should it also be done for members of /x/y?  </s>

<s> One of the advantages of picking the "root" version is that if it is a collection, it is common for the "root" version to be empty, so you don't have to traverse down the tree picking random versions all the way down.  </s>
