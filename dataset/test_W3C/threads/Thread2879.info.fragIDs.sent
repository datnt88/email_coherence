<s> I believe that the HTTP spec is wrong, and should say that 2xx responses to HEAD must not contain a body, but other responses should.  </s>
<s> We're having a problem reconciling the HTTP 1.1 spec with what servers are actually doing.  </s>
<s> The HTTP spec says (section 4.3, message body): For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with a message is dependent on both the request method and the response status code (section 6.1.1).  </s>
<s> All responses to the HEAD request method MUST NOT include a message-body, even though the presence of entity- header fields might lead one to believe they do.  </s>
<s> All 1xx (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses MUST NOT include a message-body.  </s>
<s> All other responses do include a message-body, although it may be of zero length.  </s>
<s> and also 9.4 HEAD The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response.  </s>
<s> The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request.  </s>
<s> This method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity-body itself.  </s>
<s> This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.  </s>
<s> But, in spite of this, every server we test against (and every one we've written ourselves) returns a body on ERROR responses to the HEAD request (e.g., HTML explaining the error on a 400, 401, 404, and so on).  </s>
<s> Umh.  </s>
<s> Neither Apache, IIS, or iPlanet exhibit the brokenness you describe, at least not in their default configurations when requesting a document that gives a 404.  </s>
<s> I suggest you look again... And make sure you haven't been insulted by having a so-called transparent proxy (aka.  </s>
<s> demon box from hell aka.  </s>
<s> "worst products ever") between you and the servers you are testing against.  </s>
<s> That would be contrary to all past discussion of HEAD and all implementations of HTTP prior to 1997.  </s>
<s> The only origin server that I know of that returns a body on HEAD requests is IIS when used with an ASP object that takes complete control of the socket and ignores the HTTP spec.  </s>
<s> All other instances of that behavior have been from broken firewall proxies or gateways.  </s>
<s> It certainly does not constitute a correct implementation.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> OK, OK, I blew it.  </s>
<s> The spec is right, the implementations tested (below) were wrong.  </s>
<s> Sorry Larry  </s>
