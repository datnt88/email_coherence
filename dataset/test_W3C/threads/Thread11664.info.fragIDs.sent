<s> Hello, I'm preparing a French presentation on accessibility.  </s>
<s> I want to include in my presentation some of the examples (about 30 slides) found in the "Curriculum for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" prepared by Chuck Letourneau &amp; Geoff Freed.  </s>
<s> My intention is to translate the "content" portion of the example into French without changing the header or the footer.  </s>
<s> Do I need to comply with all the requirements found in the answer to question 5.6 "Can I translate one of your specifications into another language?"  </s>
<s> (Intellectual Property FAQ) i.e.:  </s>
<s> 1.Inform the W3C of your plan to translate our content and inform us of when you've completed and published the translation.  </s>
<s> Such notice should be sent in English to w3c-translators@w3.org [public archive] and -- if provided -- the comments email list associated with that document.  </s>
<s> 2.Prominently disclose in the target language the following 3 items: 1.the original URL, the status of the document, and its original copyright notice.  </s>
<s> 2.that the normative version of the specification is the English version found at the W3C site.  </s>
<s> 3.that the translated document may contain errors from the translation.  </s>
<s> This disclosure should be made in a header and/or footer that wraps the translated W3C specification.  </s>
<s> No semantic changes should be made to any part of the W3C document including the STATUS, contributors, or appendices.  </s>
<s> If comments or annotations are absolutely necessary within the content of the specification, those annotations must be clearly represented as such.  </s>
<s> (example) 3.Agree: 1.to the redistribution terms of the W3C document copyright notice.  </s>
<s> Consequently, your translation may be republished by the W3C or other entities if it is done in compliance with the notice's terms.  </s>
<s> 2.that the W3C may rescind your right to publish or distribute the derivative work if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion regarding the original document's status or integrity.  </s>
<s> If I don't have to comply with all those requirements, which ones apply to my case?  </s>
<s> An example of a translated slide can be found in attachment.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help.  </s>

<s> Exemple Utiliser les feuilles de style pour contr x er la mise en page et la pr x entation.  </s>
<s> Example Slide 31 of 120 Utiliser les commandes des feuilles de style plut x que BLOCKQUOTE, UL, DL &amp; DT, TABLE, etc. qui sont souvent utilis x pour obtenir des effets de mise en page rapide.  </s>
<s> Chacun de ces x ents HTML a son usage propre dans la d x inition de la structure d'un document.  </s>
<s> Pour tous les trucs de mise en page rapide que vous utilisez en HTML, utiliser les feuilles de style x la place.  </s>
<s> Par exemple, vous pouvez cr x r une trame de fond de couleur pour un paragraphe donn x sans avoir x r un tableau: Si votre fureteur supporte les feuilles de style, vous verrez un texte entour x d'une bordure rouge, en retrait par rapport aux marges de la page, sur une trame de fond bleu p x e.  </s>
<s> La commande de style requise pour cr x r cet effet est la suivante: DIV style="border: thin red groove; padding: 1em; margin: 2%; background: #ccffff" Si votre fureteur... /DIV chk4-0.htm  </s>

<s> Of course you have to.  </s>
<s> Actually, you have to do a bit more.  </s>
<s> Because it's not a specification, you have to ask W3C for the permission to translate it (which I assume you have done with your mail).  </s>
<s> I'm copying Daniel Dardailler to decide on this.  </s>
<s> As for the bottom of the slide, I would propose that you say something like authors (original): Chuck Letourneau &amp; Geoff Freed translation: Mario Boutain With 'original' being a link to the original page, and 'translation' being a link to a slide that has the notices as required.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> You also have the possibility to put specific questions about glossaries and terms that you need in french in the french translators list.  </s>
