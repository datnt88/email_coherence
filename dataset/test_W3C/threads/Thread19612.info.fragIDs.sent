<s> The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.4a release of the Amaya editor/browser for both Unix and Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> This release includes some bug fixes from the previous one (1.4).  </s>
<s> Binaries are available at: Source is available at: A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html To know more about Amaya releases see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html Extensions 1.4a: * Erich Koerting updated the German dialogue files.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> * On Unix platforms only, the variable DOUBLECLICKDELAY of the registry $HOME/.thotrc  </s>
<s> allows one to control the delay (in millisecond) under which two mouse clicks are classed as a double-click.  </s>
<s> The default value is 500 ms.  </s>
<s> * Increased the default network timeout from 20000 ms to 60000 ms. * Changed the USE_CACHE registry variable to ENABLE_CACHE, to be conform to the other registry variables.  </s>
<s> Fixed bugs 1.4a: * There was a memory leak when following an internal link pointing to an inexistent anchor.  </s>
<s> * Links which point to non-existent documents or invalid URLs are now left in the "active" state, instead of being set to the "visited" state.  </s>
<s> * Browsing an image from an edited document (and thus requiring the opening of a new document window), didn't show the image.  </s>
<s> * Patches in Amaya Makefiles (suggestions from Sam and Adam) * Patch for compiling libwww under FreeBSD (contributed by Don Croyle) * When one created a table while the current selection pointed to an empty paragraph, Amaya tried to replace the empty paragraph by the table, but there was a bug which corrupted the Amaya internal structure.  </s>
<s> * When requesting a document from a slow site, pressing the Stop button before the network connection was established could crash Amaya * When downloading a document with images from the net, following any internal link in the document caused the interruption of the whole download.  </s>
<s> * There was no protection against a redirection to a URL with protocols not handled by Amaya * In case of a redirection error, Amaya would not automatically terminate the request Irene Ir?ne Vattone-mail: Irene.Vatton@inria.fr  </s>

<s> Good morning.  </s>
<s> I am using a SPARC Solaris 2.6 system.  </s>
<s> I downloaded the Binary distribution of Amaya 1.4a today, but find I am unable to make use of it.  </s>
<s> This is due to the fact that this version of Amaya has requirements for versions of dynamic X libraries which do not appear to exist at our site.  </s>
<s> If there are requirements for particular versions of X libraries would it be possible to create the binary distribution with those particular versions statically linked into the library?  </s>

<s> Unless explicitly stated to the contrary, nothing in this posting should be construed as representing my employer's opinions.  </s>
<s> I guess you got the wrong version: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html says: "Sparc Solaris 2.6 format amaya-solaris2.6-1.4a.tar.gz (about 2.030,000 bytes) gzipped tar file.  </s>
<s> In this version the Motif library is statically linked because the standard distributed version doesn't work.  </s>
<s> This library could be incompatible with your local X libraries" Do you have this 2.6 version?  </s>
<s> or hte 2.5 version?  </s>
<s> If you got the 2.6 version, I think you are in bad luck and have the incompatible libraries.  </s>
<s> If you have a compiler with your system (best to have gcc) get the source and build that one.  </s>
<s> If gcc and gmake are available, it's verry easy to build amaya.  </s>

<s> The build on Windows NT fails because the make flie does not know how to build "editor.h".  </s>
<s> This file does not seem to be included in the source distribution.  </s>
<s> The file Thot/doc/amaya/Win-Compiling.html is also not in the distribution.  </s>

<s> Hi; As a follow up to my previous message about missing files in 1.4a, it appears that an entire directory: thot/winnt/amaya, is missing.  </s>
<s> This directory at a minimum contains files "editor.h" and "html.h".  </s>
<s> This is based on the presence of dependencies .\amaya\editor.h and .\amaya\html.h in thot/winnt/amaya.mak.  </s>
<s> As was previously noted, the Thot/doc/amaya/Win-Compiling.html file is also missing from the distribution.  </s>
