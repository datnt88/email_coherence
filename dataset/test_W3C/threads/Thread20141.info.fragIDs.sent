<s> To set the default colours use a style sheet.  </s>
<s> on unix it goes in your $HOME/.amaya directory - on windows the directory is listed in the preferences dialogue (I think).  </s>
<s> Then you want amaya.css in that direcxtory, and in that file you want A:visited { color: #abc ; font-style: italic } (or whatever takes your fancy).  </s>
<s> That should probably be part of the distribution though.  </s>
