<s> Indeed, XHTML defines this attribute as all lower case.  </s>

<s> Hello Dave, Even though XHTML defines attributes to be lowercase, I (and I guess a couple other authors, too) would be happy to see an option introduced which alows to have attribute rendered in mixed case as well as either upper or lower case.  </s>
<s> I might have said this before, but just thought this'd be a good reason to throw in my $.02 again... :-) Bottom line: if not too much hassle, we'd greatly appreciate you to add "mixed case attributes" as an option for the config file.  </s>
<s> Also, I would very much appreciate an option to drop unknown attributes.  </s>
<s> My current workaround, to drop known FALSE attributes, CAN'T be the right approach... ;-) Or did I miss something and this is actually already possible?  </s>
