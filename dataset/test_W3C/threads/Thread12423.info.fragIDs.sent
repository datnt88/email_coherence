<s> I have prepared a set of powerpoint '97 slides on the recent guidelines.  </s>
<s> I did not have time to await the official set being developed in the EO working group.  </s>
<s> They are a contribution to that effort.  </s>
<s> I present them Wednesday, 19980923 at the Web conference in Boston, Hynes Convention Center Room 104 6:00 to 7:30 at a Birds of a Feather session.  </s>
<s> I'd welcome your presence.  </s>
<s> I was volunteered for this a week ago, and knew the latest and greatest draft was soon to be released.  </s>
<s> So, I've spent today readying the talk based on that 19980918 release.  </s>
<s> As they include a W3C WAI logo their size ballooned by a factor of 2 to 186Kbytes.  </s>
<s> That makes them inaccessible over email to so many.  </s>
<s> Please have a look at them from my site: or that file pkzipped (33Kbytes): I'd appreciate any critique and suggestions on repairs to them before noon tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Regards/Harvey Bingham  </s>
<s> Hope the following is helpful: On page 8 the slide says:  </s>
<s> Provide redundant information to allow understanding entirely - visually - aurally  </s>
<s> For newbies in the audience, is it worth adding: "HTML text can be aurally accessed via audio browsers or screen readers."  </s>
<s> so they know they don't need to provide real-audio of every page.  </s>
<s> On page 25 of your presentation it states:  </s>
<s> Ensure that form control labels are either immediately following control on same line...  </s>
<s> Shouldn't the label immediately precede, rather than immediately follow, the control?  </s>
<s> Hope the presentation goes well.  </s>
<s> -- Paul  </s>
<s> In response to the suggestions of both Brian Kelley and Chuck Oppermann, I've put two HTML versions of these slides out.  </s>
<s> I produced these using Convert to HTML from PowerPoint 97.  </s>
<s> These are briefly described in: or start in the directory with the html version of the page authoring guidelines: Zip file containing those 130 files: Original PowerPoint '97 file and zip of it:  </s>
