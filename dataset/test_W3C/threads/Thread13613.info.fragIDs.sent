<s> Yes, the UA section needs a lot of work.  </s>
<s> I was hoping for feedback about the AU dependencies first.  </s>
<s> I think the coordination and dependencies between ER and AU will be very similar to ER and UA.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I wanted to smooth out the one I had the most experience with (AU) before tackling the other (UA).  </s>
<s> As I noted in my request for review of the charter, I was concerned that perhaps I made the dependencies with AU WG too stringent in trying to make the dependencies clear.  </s>
<s> At the joint face2face between AU and ER we realized that ER would need to have a similar relationship with UA as we have begun to form with AU. Len has an action item to discuss this with you, Jon.  </s>
<s> The group felt that we more than likely will want to have regular meetings with UA but we were anticipating that UA would want to hold off on these until UAAG has gone to Recommendation.  </s>
<s> --wendy  </s>
<s> Wendy, I would also like a more clear statement of the proposed relationship and I think it should be brought to the UA working group for discussion.  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> Couple of comments: The relationship with user agents should be more clearly sorted out (at the moment the draft doesn't describe the relationship, just the UAWG).  </s>
<s> There is a question about what changes if maintaining a list of tools is done in concert with AU.  </s>
<s> I would guess nothing - the group is just responsible for making sure it happens, and implementation details are generally outside the scope of a charter.  </s>
<s> (I only had a quick skim) Charles McCN Hello, I have updated the draft ER WG charter based on: 1. ideas from the face2face meeting a couple weeks ago, 2. a renewed understanding of charters based on my experience with the R&amp;D IG charter grin .  </s>
<s> The major changes are in the following sections: - Mission Statement - Scope and audience - Success criteria - Dependencies and Coordination with other groups - primarily the dependency with AU is more explicit, although I am concerned I may have made it too stringent.  </s>
<s> Note that I had been pushing for us to be operating under this charter before the face2face.  </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that we (the WAI domain) will be renewing several charters at once and had decided to wait until after WWW9 and the AC meeting to finish them up.  </s>
