<s> in the case of these particular pdf documents, they are not accessible outside their environment.  </s>
<s> In the case of pdfs in general, you must create them with specific mark up in specific tools in order that they are optimized for accessibility which in this case means that there are two screen readers whose more recent itterations allow some sort of access.  </s>

<s> By this I mean that PDF meets the minimum requirements for accessibility on government sites (usually a minimum of single-A compliance) also noted by the statement that Joel "As new publications become available in Acrobat 5.0, which is 508 compliant, they will be posted on the site."  </s>
