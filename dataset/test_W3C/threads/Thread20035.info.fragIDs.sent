<s> i think that the font tag is deprecated.  </s>
<s> I hope someone can contact me directly to help on a problem i have with a specific page and trying to view it with my browser accessibility feature pointed at my own stylesheet.  </s>
<s> it has to do with text made blue with font color="blue" .  </s>
<s> but my stylesheet is quiet about colors and the text becomes invisible ..... if i remove my stylesheet, everything is viewable if someone knows how things are supposed to work with accessibility sheets (unfortunately not implemented yet in amaya) could they please write ve3ll@rac.ca  </s>

<s> Yes, it is deprecated, but I think John's problem is with applying his own stylesheet to someone else's page so that he can read it.  </s>
<s> I told John off list that I suspect one reason for deprecating the font tag was because its settings could not be overridden with CSS - is that true?  </s>
<s> And thus someone with an accessibility concern cannot make the page readable .  </s>
