<s> i'm writing to inform you that, due to a rather nasty stomach virus, i will not be able to attend this afternoon's teleconference, despite the fact that i want to defend my proposal (that 2.7.2 be re-numbered 2.7.1 and accorded a P!, that 2.7.1 be re-numbered 2.7.2 and accorded a P2, and that 2.7.3 be left as is) and that i am most interested in the discussion of priority levels... gregory.  </s>
