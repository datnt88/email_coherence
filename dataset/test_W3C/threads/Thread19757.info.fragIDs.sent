<s> Using the Oct 24 version of Amaya 1.1b on a Win95, pentium 133, with 32 meg, dial-up connection, true color 24 bit, I have observed the following critters: The stop button doesn't appear to function.  </s>
<s> The rendering of graphics to text using a stylesheet (I assume) is not correct.  </s>
<s> Visit http://www.w3.org/style/ as an example.  </s>
<s> Scroll bar is unstable when dragging it with the mouse.  </s>
<s> Clicking between the bar and end points seems to work ok.  </s>
<s> Web documents do not appear to be cached when using the back button.  </s>
<s> Since it refuses to load local documents, I have not taken the time to check it our further.  </s>
<s> Keep up the great work, though!  </s>

<s> We've troubles with the event loop on Windows platform and we don't manage different buttons state.  </s>
<s> You know that this release is an Alpha release and we're still working on it.  </s>
<s> The stylesheet implementation is not complete neither in Unix nor in Windows versions.  </s>
<s> In particular, positioning properties used in this css page are not implemented.  </s>
<s> Yes but it's not easy to understand why.  </s>
<s> The Windows API is not always clear and complete.  </s>
<s> You're right.  </s>
<s> I'm sure, it shouldn't.  </s>
<s> I've not problem to open a local file.  </s>
<s> How do you do that: using the open menu or using the address field ?  </s>

<s> Using the file  open  technique, Amaya doesn't appear to allow spaces in a local directory name.  </s>
<s> Win95 does allow this.  </s>

<s> That's not the only problem.  </s>
<s> Amaya also cannot handle relative addresses and is always looking for files in the root directory: In the document c:\test\index.html there is a link to a file in the same directory: A HREF="file1.html" file1 /A .  </s>
<s> Amaya is not looking for c:\test\file1.html, but for c:\file1.html  </s>
<s> and therefore cannot find the file.  </s>
<s> Maybe this is also the reason why Amaya doesn't display images (when I place an image in the root, it is displayed correct).  </s>
