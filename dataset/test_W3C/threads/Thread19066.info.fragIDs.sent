<s> All of the documents, especially the myriad of such things on EO as "How People With Disabilities Use the Web" fall far short in both the "clear/simple" and "Use multimedia to illustrate concepts" departments - and it is one of our best efforts!  </s>
<s> We use the same excuses about our failures in these areas that are forwarded by Web designers: time/resources/priorities - meanwhile we exemplify a tinge of hypocrisy that, although tempering our rage at inaccessibility, is unbecoming.  </s>
