<s> Greetings.  </s>
<s> I refer to the draft guidelines as above.  </s>
<s> (Excuse me but I am not subscribed to your list; an email copy of any responses would be appreciated, although I would see them anyway in due course in your archives).  </s>
<s> You were kind enough to include mention of my www article on the topic of ALT texts.  </s>
<s> I have to say frankly that this article originally approached the subject from the point of view of accessibility to text mode browsers, and not specifically to persons with disabilities, an area in which I have no particular expertise; it has become clear that some of the details in my article were inappropriate for the latter purpose, and I have reworked them over time to try to reach a good compromise.  </s>
<s> However, there remain some points on which I would take issue with the guidelines as presented.  </s>
<s> The principle from which I have proceeded is that the ALT text is literally "alternative text", i.e it provides a textual substitute for the _information_ or _purpose_ of the image.  </s>
<s> There are other attributes (TITLE and, now, LONGDESC) available for other purposes such as _describing_ the image.  </s>
<s> At: "Provide alternative text for all images and image maps." it says: "Each image should have alternative text that describes the function of the graphic" I disagree.  </s>
<s> What is wanted is not a _description_ of the function, but the function itself.  </s>
<s> Of the examples given, "Section Title: Banana Products," and "Search Button." seem fine, but "Graph of population versus age," is _no_ alternative text presentation of the _information_.  </s>
<s> Rather, this would be more appropriate IMO as the TITLE attribute.  </s>
<s> What the text mode reader needs to know is not _that_ there is a graph present, but what the heck does the graph show that is relevant to the topic under discussion?  </s>
<s> If the text already makes that clear, then maybe ALT="" is appropriate.  </s>
<s> Surely, calling the text-mode reader's attention to a graph that they can't read, while telling them nothing about what information it contains, is worse than useless?  </s>
<s> And in the "possible strategies", again we have a description of information, instead of the information itself.  </s>
<s> IMG src="logo.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="XYZ Logo" cannot possibly be right, in my view.  </s>
<s> If the logo is there in order to identify the company, then the name of the company would be appropriate, e.g ALT="XYZ Corp", whereas if the company name is already present in clear text, then ALT="" would seem more appropriate, unless their logo is somehow pertinent to the topic under discussion, rather than mere identification.  </s>
<s> I reiterate: surely stating that a logo is there is unproductive if the only purpose was to identify the company, and equally unproductive if the purpose was to acquaint the reader with this company's logo.  </s>
<s> In no sense is ALT="XYZ logo" an alternative text that can substitute for the purpose of the image, unless the image's purpose was to introduce the logo into the discussion for some reason.  </s>
<s> With a little thought it's possible to choose ALT texts such that the text reads naturally, and the text-mode reader is scarcely aware of the "seams".  </s>
<s> Pages that have been composed "by rote", putting ALT="XYZ logo" whenever the logo occurs, tend to read idiotically on a text mode browser.  </s>
<s> Almost as bad as those that have ALT="large red bullet" etc.  </s>
<s> I note the advice given at "Provide descriptive titles for all images used as links." and the example I'm thinking this one over.  </s>
<s> I had always been accustomed to marking this up something like but I can see the point - though again I have the same reservations about  </s>
<s> using ALT to _describe_ the information, rather than to substitute for it.  </s>
<s> "Avoid ASCII art.  </s>
<s> Replace it with an image and alternative text."  </s>
<s> That guideline is addressing the main body of the text, but it is clearly also applicable to ALT texts.  </s>
<s> There is as yet no reliable way of providing a decorative HR (along the lines of the old HTML3.0 HR SRC="..." proposal).  </s>
<s> Well-implemented style sheet support should make something possible, but meantime, page designers are going to continue using IMGs in place of HRs, and it's hard to know what to use as the ALT text.  </s>
<s> Previously I had been suggesting the use of "ASCII art", but here I have taken your recommendation on board, and categorised the use of "ASCII art" in an ALT text as deprecated by accessibility guidelines.  </s>
<s> You do have a nice suggestion that will be appropriate in a proportion of cases, I see.  </s>
<s> Turning to the "Central" document, in 13.3 the same 'ALT="XYZ logo"' example appears.  </s>
<s> So often when I feel an ALT has been poorly chosen, it is because it is _describing_the_image_ when it ought to have been _substituting for the purpose of the image_.  </s>
<s> Referring to the " tips and tricks concerning alternative text ", I read: "2.Sometimes it is easier to describe what the function of the graphic is rather than what it is or looks like.  </s>
<s> " It's not only "sometimes easier": I would say it is often more appropriate.  </s>
<s> I would rather say "The ALT text should substitute for the _purpose_ of the image; the mere description of the graphic will rarely be appropriate for doing that".  </s>
<s> I hope these comments are useful.  </s>
<s> Sorry if they were a bit long winded.  </s>
<s> best regards  </s>
<s> I tend to agree with Flavell.  </s>
<s> I also have a followup question.  </s>
<s> I think the guidelines should have some kind of "deprecated" guidelines.  </s>
<s> In order to help authors to fix their old pages, or to help authors who will never bother writing stylesheets for non-visual media.  </s>
<s> (only a minority is writing those for screen) Many authors can't afford being "perfect" and one should find a way to help them (see Chris Hasser: Censorship by laziness) The deprecated guidlines in question include the following: Many authors use HTML art (a cousin of ASCII art) to do decoration to their pages (I know it's bad). the question is how to make it "invisible" to non-visual browsers.  </s>
<s> In images, writing alt=" " seems to work (for Lynx at least) Should HR title=" " do the job for a HR used to underline a heading?  </s>
<s> The answer depends on how non visual browsers present HR, when it has a title.  </s>
<s> Do they just present the title or do something in addition?  </s>
<s> Mentioning HR, should an IMG serving as real HR have the ALT as the guide lines propose for title.  </s>
<s> E.g., ALT="Footnotes" ?  </s>
<s> I think so, no? Flavell correctly deprecated ALT="-----------".  </s>
<s> I think that HTML art is going to increase, since the comercial community is worried about bandwidth, and ways to reduce the use of images.  </s>
<s> People are hesitent with stylesheets due to slow and buggy implementation, as well as the need for the author to understand complicated concepts like inheretence and cascading order.  </s>
<s> I saw in Web Review an article proposing to use HTML art by making some drawings with tables.  </s>
<s> The idea is to make a grid and paint the different cells with different colors.  </s>
<s> overall this method could be speech friendly.  </s>
<s> It is evidently Lynx friendly (up to a possible strange space).  </s>
<s> The question is what a non-visual browser will do with a table whose cells have only nbsp in them?  </s>
<s> Will it make some "noises" (speech browser)?  </s>
<s> e.g. [TABLE] as Lynx writes [IMAGE] for an image without an ALT attribute?  </s>
<s> ( I know I can hide the table with a stylesheet, and make it important to be on the safe side, but 99% will never write a stylesheet for the non-visual media, at least in the near future.) Nir Dagan dagan@upf.es  </s>
<s> Since the way in which ALT content is defined, and therefore interpreted by both browser developers and content providers is, IMO, crucial to the effective rendering of information in a meaningful cross-platform manner.  </s>
<s> I have reservations as to whether the discussion of the use of ALT content should be restricted to a forum which appears to be devoted to the concerns of "Accessibility", which is bound to be seen as of minority concern.  </s>
<s> However, AFIACS this forum appears to be the only one addressing the problem - or should this be discussed in w3c-wai-gl, -ui, or -au instead?  </s>
<s> (In fact, how can one hope to come up with a concensus if the three interested groups are discussing the issues independently of each other?) I am keen to have the usage of ALT properly defined in an unambiguous way, at the earliest possible juncture, in order that browser developers and content providers may both work towards a common goal.  </s>
<s> The present situation is that content providers ("Web Authors") have to constantly struggle to markup inline content such that it still makes sense when "viewed" in a non-graphical environment.  </s>
<s> Recently, this situation became *worse*, instead of better, due to the implementation by some browsers of ALT text as popup tooltips in a graphical environment.  </s>
<s> I would argue that this functionality is totally incorrect.  </s>
<s> Consider, for instance, the common usage of such constructs as: When rendered by a browser that displays ALT text as tooltips, the user interface is spoilt.  </s>
<s> In this example, it can be argued that it is a simple matter to alter the markup such that it reads However, AIUI there are user agents which require the use of a space, not a null string, in order to render sensible content.  </s>
<s> I have written a page which deals with this matter in some more detail, and gives examples to illustrate my concerns: In article Pine.OSF.3.96.980205192149.10146C-100000@a5.ph.gla.ac.uk , "Alan J. Flavell" flavell@a5.ph.gla.ac.uk writes [much useful commentary snipped]  </s>
<s> I am in total agreement with Alan here.  </s>
<s> Where the IMG is unavailable to the user agent (for whatever reason), rendering "XYZ logo" in its place as recommended in this example is IMO worse than useless.  </s>
<s> Of what use is this information to a blind user?  </s>
<s> A sighted user would be better served by the presentation of simply "XYZ".  </s>
<s> The example that Alan cites here hides another can of worms in the context of tooltips.  </s>
<s> Consider the following, where the markup has been employed in the manner which I feel is appropriate (ALT as a _replacement_ for the missing image, TITLE as _supplementary information_ for the element): Unless there are clear guidelines as to how tooltips are to interpret such markup, the possibilities for future confusion and poor backward compatibility are endless :( A short while ago, on www-html: In article 01ISU2RGUNG200877V@SCI.WFBR.EDU , Foteos Macrides MACRIDES@SCI.WFBR.EDU writes [discussion snippage]  </s>
<s> So what you want is: IMG SRC="foo.blah"  </s>
<s> ALT="alternative_string" TITLE="tooltip_string" and broader implementation and understanding of this provision in HTML 4.0.  </s>
