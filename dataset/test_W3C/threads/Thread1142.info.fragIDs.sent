<s> Hi, I am very new to tidy and have just been testing tidy on our web site.  </s>
<s> I have it working just fine with files using the test command "./tidy -clean --word-2000 yes wordhtml.htm"  </s>
<s> Now what I really want to do, is provide tidy with a string of html (from posting an html form) instead of "wordhtml.htm".  </s>
<s> I was going to do this with the PHP extension http://pecl.php.net/package/tidy but my hosting provider won't install it.  </s>
<s> So I've been trying to do this from the command line, but I can't figure out how to do this.  </s>
<s> Thanks for any help... Jo  </s>
<s> Just curious - - a while back, I attempted to create a config file so that Tidy would recognized ASP.Net Server controls and not break everytime it saw one - - I was never successful - -  </s>
<s> Was any more effort put into this area of Tidy?  </s>

<s> takes a different approach to use Tidy in ASP.NET and will clean the output of web controls rather than their source which sounds more reasonable to me.  </s>
