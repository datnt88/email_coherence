<s> Hello, Trying to catch up with the emails exchanged during the past 2 months, I'm attempting to capture the 2 emerging solutions that I have identified (*not* saying that these are the only 2, nor that the requirements phase is ended):  </s>
<s> 1. RDF in XHTML using a mix of schemas technologies, mainly proposed and developed by Masayasu [1]; this solution involves putting real RDF inside the XHTML Markup; the XHTML Markup could be validated using a schema validator  </s>
<s> 2. RDF expressed in XHTML, where the RDF content would be extractable from an XHTML document using a well-defined process (such as XSLT); this solution has been championned by Dan Connolly [2]  </s>
<s> It is still a bit unclear to me if solution-1 does indeed require that entities are expressible in XML Schema (as asserted in [3]).  </s>
<s> I would be interested to hear if this is a fair summary of the current situation, esp.  </s>
<s> from Mimama and DanC.  </s>

<s> Right, the issue there was that I don't know what sort of doctype/namespace these documents would have.  </s>
<s> I don't think we could sneak it under any of the existing ones.  </s>
<s> Mimasa mentioned that folks were considering how to do modularization with non-DTDs, but I that's nascent work.  </s>
<s> The issue here is whether we could ask RDF applications to support an "input transform" mechanism, with XSLT as an obvious option?  </s>

<s> Do you have any new input on the various topics related to XHTML in RDF Task Force, namely about: - the conformance/validity model of XHTML2 (based on DTD/schemas/other?) - the possibility of having XHTML2 schemas flexible enough to allow inclusion of RDF while maintaining a validation model - the interferences of XHTML entities with such a possible model Thanks, Dom 1. 3. http://www.w3.org/2003/03/rdf-in-xml#rdfwg-htmlwg Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/ERCIM  </s>
