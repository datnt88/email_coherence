<s> Just reread this more carefully from Leonard: In most conventional thesauri, "related" relationships are treated as  </s>
<s> symmetric, even though more precise specification would recognise that  </s>
<s> many of them are directional, e.g. activity/agent, process/product, cause/effect and so on.  </s>
<s> If such a conventional thesaurus is encoded in SKOS format, should such  </s>
<s> relationships be shown as "skos:relatedSymmetric", that being the way they are treated, or should they be given the more general coding "skos:related", leaving the way open to refine the nature of the relationship in future?  </s>
<s> Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  </s>

<s> If we define skos:related as being symmetric, can we define subProperties as being inverse, or otherwise not entirely symetric?  </s>
<s> If we can do this at the same level (I think these are both in OWL, but I am not familiar enough with the specifications to know the answer to my question above) then I think it is the best solution.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, in the interest of not making the tricky (but often interesting) things impossible, I suggest we define relatedSymmetric as a subProperty of related, and make that a symmetric relation.  </s>
<s> (Alternatively we could define related as being symmetric, and a subProperty of rdfs:seeAlso, and non-symmetric relations as subProperties of seeAlso or  </s>
<s> of some relatedAsymmmetric property.  </s>
<s> The two proposals are just alternate labels for the same concepts, as far as I can tell).  </s>
