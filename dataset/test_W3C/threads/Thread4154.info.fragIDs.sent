<s> A question about path expressions:  </s>
<s> "/" is a legal expression  </s>
<s> "/ + 5" also seems to be legal so, "(/) * 5" is probably legal "(/) div 5" likewise what about "/ * 5" or "/ div 5"  </s>
<s> Do we require spaces?  </s>
<s> Or parentheses?  </s>
<s> Or does an xpath parser need to look ahead to distinguish these cases?  </s>
<s> (My vote is for parentheses).  </s>

<s> My understanding is that we require parentheses, but I'm not sure this is  </s>

<s> The examples above are actually all legal in XPath 1.0,  </s>
<s> which has a known bug in that it doesn't describe how to disambiguate these  </s>
<s> cases.  </s>
<s> Fortunately none of the above examples is likely to appear often in  </s>
<s> real code.  </s>
<s> In XPath 2.0, though, it becomes more likely: for example "if (/ is $n)" needs to be written as "if ((/) is $n)", or perhaps as "if (/. is  </s>
<s> $n)".  </s>
<s> Or you can always write root(.)!  </s>

<s> I have an action item (ACTION-Gaith-6) to clarify this in the documents  </s>
<s> for the next pub, though it should be theoretically unambiguous from the lexical state tables.  </s>
<s> "/" does not recognize operators (i.e. symbols recognized in the OPERATOR state) immediately following it.  </s>

<s> (In fact, I suggested in another thread that the lexical state tables be removed from the document, in order to force the grammar to be complete and consistent by itself.)  </s>

<s> Yes, I agree completely, I did not mean to infer otherwise.  </s>
<s> This has been discussed by the WG several times now.  </s>
<s> So far, we've opted to keep it, and keep it normative -- implementors have found it useful, and no matter how detailed we are in the prose, the tables do clearly disambiguate the grammar in a declarative fashion.  </s>
