<s> I noticed that closure rule rdf2 in will generate an infinite number of triples from any triple with an xml literal as its object.  </s>
<s> I was wondering if there was a reason to prefer the form of the closure rule given over one of the form: sss1 ppp1 xml1 sss2 ppp2 xml2 sss1 ppp1 _:x sss2 ppp2 _:x where xml1 and xml2 denote the same XML literal value.  </s>

<s> Is that really the case?  </s>
<s> I still have not got a clear picture of what the XMLliteral value is supposed to be or how it relates to the lexical form, but my understanding was that the lex2value mapping was a pretty simple normalization process, so that the set of lexical forms which map to the same 'value' would be reasonably small.  </s>
<s> Im not sure if that would be sufficient to find all entailments, but I'll think about it.  </s>
<s> BTW  there is an obvious way to limit se1 and se2 to keep those closures finite, which I suspect you already noticed, when I read you earlier message more carefully: do not apply them to bnodes.  </s>
<s> Duh.  </s>

<s> In the lexical space and the value space XMLLiterals are simply (isomorhpic to?) strings.  </s>
<s> i.e. identity and equality are the same.  </s>
<s> However, in RDF/XML documents Brian is correct, you can have arbitrarty  </s>
<s> whitespace in certain places - but it gets squashed before you get to the lexical space.  </s>

<s> The best thing in any case is to phrase the rule in terms of replacing XML literal strings by their canonical versions.  </s>
<s> This kills even the dead birds with one stone and is fine for checking closures.  </s>
<s> New editor's draft will have this modification.  </s>
