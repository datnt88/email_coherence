<s> Regarding check #7: I do wonder if it is better to separate this out a little.  </s>
<s> All anchors need text in one form or another.  </s>
<s> It doesn't matter if the text is in alt or straight text, just so long as it exists.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a check: Anchor text can't be empty.  </s>
<s> This would cover a href="#content" /a as well as missing alt text in anchors.  </s>
<s> Once this is covered, all you need to worry about with images is the validity and then the common "bad alt" checks.  </s>
<s> If a testing tool finds: It should flag two errors: 1) anchor text empty (definite error)  </s>
<s> 2) missing alt text (possible error) I'd like the missing alt text to be a positive error, but am not sure how that will work.  </s>
<s> AWK This should be ok:  </s>

<s> This should be ok: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd" a href="somewhere" img src="rex.jpg"  </s>
<s> alt=""/ img src="rex.jpg"  </s>
<s> alt="Rex"/ /a This should be ok (there are better examples, but you get the point here): !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd" a href="somewhere" img src="rex.jpg"  </s>

<s> hi all, I have a few questions about the anchor tag that arose from reading Chris' post.  </s>
<s> Why is an empty anchor tag considered an error?  </s>
<s> Is it because it is syntactically incorrect, or is it because some user agents do not use them correctly?  </s>
<s> Please include authoritative documentation in answering these questions, if possible.  </s>
<s> Thanks Shane Anderson Programmer Analyst Web Accessibility in Mind (WebAIM.org)  </s>
<s> To clarify, this should be an empty anchor that contains an href attribute.  </s>
<s> a href="http://www.boston.com"  </s>
<s> /a is valid, and in some cases will be understandable to a screen reader user (as much so as a href="http://www.boston.com"  </s>
<s> http://www.boston.com  </s>
<s> /a is).  </s>
<s> However, this won't be understandable for many URIs, such as what you see on a database generated site, nor will they be accessible to sighted users, or easy to locate for keyboard users.  </s>
<s> AWK  </s>
<s> This check was in response to the WCAG 2 HTML technique 9.2 "Use text equivalents for images which are used as links."  </s>
<s> [1] The technique deals with images and (I think) is meant to solve the problem that occurs when the author uses an image alone (no text) as the anchor.  </s>
<s> If you can't see the image then you won't have any information about the link destination.  </s>
<s> The WCAG 2 HTML techs currently don't say anything about link text.  </s>
<s> The WCAG 1 requirement for not using meaningless link text (e.g. "click here") is missing in the WCAG 2. So it appears that empty link text would be OK!? Michael - Can you remind us what's happening the technique for link text?  </s>

<s> if possible.  </s>
<s> When an IMG is used as an anchor, you've got to have a text equivalent.  </s>
<s> But what's the best way to implement the text equivalent?  </s>
<s> Within the anchor: Alt text: Title on anchor: Title on IMG: Using all 4: a title="cats" href="cats.html"  </s>
<s> img src="cat.jpg"  </s>
<s> alt="cats" title="cats" / cats /a I tried this on Jaws 4.5 and it read the text fine no matter where it was.  </s>
<s> When the text was on all 4 it only read the text twice.  </s>
<s> I propose that there must be at least one place for the text.  </s>
<s> Doesn't matter where and it can be on multiple places.  </s>
<s> Yes, it may be read more than once if it occurs multiple times but it gives more flexability.  </s>
