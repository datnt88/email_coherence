<s> Hello I am new to the listserv and designed/maintain a website for a group that does research on aging with disabilities.  </s>
<s> So, the audience is very diverse, many professors as well as advocates who may use assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> I've run my site through numerous validators but always get some things that seem very odd.  </s>
<s> For example, on the Lift validator it says I have an audio element when I don't.  </s>
<s> Or things that say I need long descriptions, for relatively simple images.  </s>
<s> Most of the red flags are section 508 warnings.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have any advice on how I should get my page validated?  </s>
<s> A-Prompt seems more reasonable, because I can check things out and then say that they are fixed.  </s>
<s> The site is here  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for your responses and any resources you can suggest.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Sheila Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!  </s>

<s> Hello Sheila - welcome to the WAI IG mailing list.  </s>
<s> First of all I think we need to get a few concepts out of the way, namely that of "Validation".  </s>
<s> Typically that word refer to checking the HTML code for syntax errors, which is a straightforward matter for http://validator.w3.org/ - as you are probably aware, making sure documents are syntactically correct is a WCAG checkpoint though sadly a priority 2. What you seem to be looking for is a way to validate the *accessibility* of a website.  </s>
<s> This is a far harder task.  </s>
<s> There are no automated processes which can test for all aspects of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Of the ones that are available, "Bobby" may the most used.  </s>
<s> It seems to still have a few errors.  </s>
<s> My favourite is a tool called siteSifter, but it is strictly commercial.  </s>
<s> The one I would recommend you look into is called Site Valet, and can be found at http://valet.webthing.com/  </s>
<s> Good luck!  </s>

<s> Hi Shiela, I agree with Tina that there are no tools that can do the whole job for you.  </s>
<s> If you are serious about wanting to keep accessibility as good as possible, I would suggest that you become as familiar as possible with W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG - reference, although there are others), and then look for tools that you find helpful.  </s>
<s> Having worked on WCAG since the first W3C draft I rely on having a lot of it in memory, and on using the checklist as a reminder when I am verifying my work.  </s>
<s> In my experience the best tools are ones which allow you to monitor a whole site in development, and most of them are commercial.  </s>
<s> Of the free tools available I have found the Wave and el TAW (in Spanish) suit my personal preferences and working style.  </s>
<s> I would prefer tools that integrate with my authoring environment better, but I have a weird authoring process so have to think a bit harder.  </s>
<s> There are a number of tools that integrate with commercial web authoring software - in any event my advice is to, look for something that suits you, and interpret its results in light of your own knowledge and what you learn.  </s>
<s> There is a list of tools for evaluation and repair, both commercial and free, that is more or less maintained by W3C, at so often for changes.  </s>
<s> This is a field with fairly significant development happening, so your choice today may not be the one you would make in a year, or would have made a year ago.  </s>
