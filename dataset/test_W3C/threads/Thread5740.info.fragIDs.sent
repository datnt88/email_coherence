<s> Hello all, When translating OWL Guide, I stumbled on what is likely a typo: 5.1.3.  </s>
<s> Complement [OWL DL] In paragraph after first example, this sentence: The class of NonConsumableThing includes as its members all individuals that do not belong to the extension of ConsumableThing.  </s>
<s> This set includes all *Wines*, Regions, etc. [...]  </s>
<s> It should read: "This set includes all *Winerys*, Regions, etc."  </s>
<s> hih, JJS.  </s>
<s> thanks for your reading of the guide and your email.  </s>
<s> you are right, wines should not be listed.  </s>
<s> (although we should say wineries instead of winerys)  </s>

<s> Deborah, Indeed :-) However, I would like to point out a somehow related issue, that is the use of plural forms when dealing with property or element names of the language, or even with arbitrary class names.  </s>
<s> For example, consider the following sentence found in first paragraph of section 4 of OWL Overview http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#s4 : Furthermore, OWL DL requires that properties are either ObjectProperties or DatatypeProperties: DatatypeProperties are relations between instances of classes and RDF literals and XML Schema datatypes, while ObjectProperties are relations between instances of two classes.  </s>
<s> A native English speaker will probably take "ObjectProperties" (or "DatatypeProperties"), meaning obviously "several occurrences of properties of type DatatypeProperty".  </s>
<s> But other natural language may have different plural forms and rules, or conventions (at least in Western languages).  </s>
<s> When translating, one would normally take into account these differences and "adapt" the original wording as to match the target language conventions.  </s>
<s> Generally, in order to obviate any ambiguity, it ends up in the sentence being more explicit.  </s>
<s> So, for example, the sentence above would become something like: "Futhermore, OWL DL requires that properties are either of type ObjectProperty or DatatypeProperty: properties of type DatatypeProperty are relations ..." The same applies to arbitrary class names.  </s>
<s> In either case, a problem lies in the fact that the plural forms of these class names often don't match those in definitions.  </s>
<s> For example, there are "Wines" in the text , but there is owl:Class rdf:ID='Wine' in the definition.  </s>
<s> And, due to markup, both terms appear in the same monospaced font, adding to the confusion.  </s>
<s> Though this topic is probably better suited in w3c-translators, it may also be of interest here.  </s>
<s> hih, JJS  </s>
