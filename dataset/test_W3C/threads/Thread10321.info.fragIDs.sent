<s> As I recall, the "Exclusive XML Canonicalization" is an *octet* sequence, not a character sequence, and as such is not eligible to be a lexical form.  </s>

<s> But they've just said the canonical form is the UTF-8 encoding.  </s>
<s> I'd like to believe this works, but maybe some belt-and-braces would help us to to be sure, such as: The string used as the lexical form of the XML Literal is the Canonical XML obtained by applying Exclusive XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]), with comments and with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList, to the literal text l, i.e. the entire element content of this property element.  </s>
<s> That is, it is a Unicode string whose UTF-8 encoding is the Canonical XML form of the literal.  </s>

<s> Couldn't we get away with the current text and a pedant's note in brackets ... e.g. .... current text ... (Strictly, it is a Unicode string whose UTF-8 encoding is the Canonical XML form described).  </s>
