<s> One of the item on our list is I added the messages from the thread Chris Lilley, Dave Raggett and myself had internally to W3C. Please read and comment.  </s>
<s> Clearly it would be best to build on the solution that has already been developed in CSS 2. I share the concern expressed in Daniel's mailing list thread, that authors might try to convey significant information in the image which is to be used as a list bullet.  </s>
<s> A means of associating a textual label or description with the image, for use in non-graphical media, would therefore seem to be warranted.  </s>
<s> This is another example of a situation in which a metadata approach based on HTTP would offer the best  </s>
<s> solution.  </s>
<s> However, there is a strong tendency toward reliance on markup as the means by which to convey the textual alternative to a graphical resource.  </s>
<s> Indeed, given the ALT attribute, the design of OBJECT and the LONGDESC proposal, there is hardly any need for a metadata approach, except in two situations: (1) frames; and (2) the list image bullet in CSS.  </s>
<s> It would seem reasonable to suppose that HTML authors, who would be responsible for taking advantage of ALT and OBJECT, might not be willing to make the extra effort of preparing metadata so as to provide textual substitutes for certain images, merely for the sake of the anomalous circumstances in which the HTML markup and CSS do not offer a solution.  </s>
<s> I have no objection to pursuing the metadata strategy, thereby making available two alternative methods of associating text with an image.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, it appears inconsistent to rely on markup for most purposes but to insist on the implementation of a metadata scheme in a limited range of circumstances in which HTML and CSS 2 currently fail to give scope for associating text with a graphical resource.  </s>
<s> CSS1 uses the property list-style-image to set the image URL.  </s>
<s> A simple fix would be to allow this property to take a descriptive string following the URL, e.g. list-style-image: url(warning.gif)  </s>
<s> warning where the text "warning" takes the role of alt text for the list bullet image.  </s>
<s> A general trend in CSS1 was to provide separate properties corresponding to each part of a compound property, e.g. border-left-width versus border.  </s>
<s> It would make sense to also provide several properties related to the list bullet image, e.g. width, height, alt text and alignment.  </s>
<s> For instance: list-style-image: url(warning.gif)  </s>
<s> list-style-image-text: warning list-style-image-width: 16 list-style-image-height: 16 I believe that these could be added without difficulty to CSS2, provided we insist.  </s>
<s> I don't care much about the exact names of the properties which we can leave the CSS&amp;FP group to decide.  </s>

<s> I discussed this issue with Hakon Lie yesterday and we concluded a few interested things.  </s>
<s> First, it seems like a bad idea to add semantics information like ALT text to a piece of style sheet.  </s>
<s> The reason is that it's possible, likely in fact, that a particular  </s>
<s> style sheet be dropped in favor of another one by the browser, so any valuable information would be lost.  </s>
<s> Second, the real place for content is the markup, and in the case of  </s>
<s> image bullet where a description is needed, the following design is probably better: and have a list-style-type set to 'none' so the bullet is removed and the image is used (with all its attributes).  </s>

<s> DP: This is the critical point.  </s>
<s> ALT text is content.  </s>
<s> We may add a few adjectives to 'content', but content it is, therefore it should be part of the document.  </s>
<s> Regards, DaveP  </s>
<s> I would agree with Hakon.  </s>
<s> Style sheets should be used to help out in the case of more generic bullets like redball.gif  </s>
<s> --given that one of the hoped for results of deploying CSS is that html pages will take less time to download because authors no longer need to embed gifs for obtaining stylized bullets, the style sheet would also be the right place for mapping a generic set of gifs to a generic set of semantic attributes, e.g. bullet.  </s>
<s> But where a bullet is more specific e.g. *WARNING* the style sheet is the wrong place to stick that information in.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Pawson, David said:  </s>
<s> Styles need to be able to apply images that the HTML didn't know about.  </s>
<s> Maybe the text alternative to an image invoked in a stylesheet is in an alternative stylesheet -- i.e. one designed for the character-grid medium.  </s>
<s> I believe that the clean way to style this is that if you want the bullet to be "New!" or "Reduced!" emblazoned on an eye-catching splash of color, that the list item should have CLASS="...,new" and the style should select new-in-splash.jpg as the bullet image.  </s>
<s> Whether or not the style language needs the capablility to provide an ALT string at this point is a function of the overall style control logic which is defined by the stylesheet language.  </s>
<s> If the style selection automatically falls back to "find a style in another sheet that fits when you can't implement this style" then the textual bullet styling in another stylesheet will suffice.  </s>
<s> If the stylesheet language says you have to stick to one sheet, then it will want to offer alternatives locally.  </s>
<s> DD The reason is that it's possible, likely in fact, that a particular  </s>
<s> DD Second, the real place for content is the markup,  </s>
<s> You can't say categorically that ALT text is content.  </s>
<s> Only if there was articulable information in the selection of the icon is there content in the ALT.  </s>
<s> The ALT may be content-free, too.  </s>
<s> And various degrees of significance in between.  </s>
<s> I believe it is better to try to express the canonical "content" in the classes used to categorize [the list items] and let the bullet realization used in any medium, for which the ALT serves today as the realization in character-grid, speech, and Braille, be an expression of that content.  </s>
<s> -- Al Gilman PS: There is still another issue dealing with list items.  </s>
<s> It is desirable to force the sensitive graphic region for a list item to enclose both bullet and text.  </s>
<s> Can this be done by nesting LI inside A? Or do we need to be able to wrap items in a container which unifies control sensitivity over its contents as an atomic unit?  </s>
<s> [forces content to contain only one sensitive item; forces User interface to accept stimulus targeted to any of the blocked content as equivalent].  </s>
<s> to follow up on what T. V. Raman said:  </s>
<s> I believe that RDF is also pitching itself as a capability for solving the "generic" case.  </s>
<s> If the red ball is a captive slave of the stylesheet then the stylesheet is a fine place to put its generic text alternative, but if the same red ball is used more widely and independently of the particular stylesheet, we want to look further up the supply chain for where text alternatives can be introduced and propagated through the system.  </s>
<s> ClipArt libraries of images for use a bullets should contain ALT text nominees up front.  </s>
<s> Agree. CLASSify the item appropriately.  </s>
<s> -- Al PS: note that in the draft workplan I asked that we create a generic information model of content expressible as text and associated with an image and then look at all the ways the image enters the system and see if we need to be able to explicitly alter the text-item associations at that point or not.  </s>
<s> The discussion above suggests that we need to be able to set some of these things in the clip art library, in the style, and in the document.  </s>
<s> Not necessarily one opportunity per attribute, either.  </s>
<s> Sorry-- RDF has little if nothing to do with this problem/issue.  </s>

<s> Please compare and contrast - what RDF has to do with - this problem/issue as you see it.  </s>
<s> -- Al  </s>
<s> Upon reflection, it is plainly evident that the image itself, together with ALT text, should be found within the document rather than as part of a style sheet.  </s>
<s> If an audio or braille-based user agent is formatting the document, then it will only apply styles which are explicitly labeled as pertaining, respectively, to the AURAL and BRAILLE media types.  </s>
<s> Thus, the author's SCREEN (or perhaps PRINT) style sheet, in which the image corresponding to the list bullet is referred to, will under such circumstances be ignored completely by the user agent.  </s>
<s> Consequently, if the image is intended to convey any semantically significant content, then it will need to be included in the HTML document itself, in the manner that Daniel has suggested.  </s>
