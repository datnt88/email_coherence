<s> Don't recall if this has been mentioned here.  </s>
<s> Brainbench (www.brainbench.com) has a test on accessible web design techniques, which is free to take.  </s>
<s> It's pretty hard -- I know, cuz I helped work on it -- but it's got a pretty wide scope as well and is about as comprehensive as a general test of this type could be.  </s>
<s> Note: I can't speak for the accessibility of the Brainbench testing system itself, that's something that's beyond my ability to control.  </s>
<s> Also, I don't get anything if you go use this, so I'm not just noting this for my own self-promotion!  </s>

<s> where is it located I went to the site but couldn't find it???  </s>
<s> There is a search box for tests -- type in 'accessibility' and it's one of the options.  </s>
<s> That's the easiest way I've found for it.  </s>
<s> --Kynn PS: Again don't blame me for anything at Brainbench's site except maybe a few questions on this one test.  </s>
