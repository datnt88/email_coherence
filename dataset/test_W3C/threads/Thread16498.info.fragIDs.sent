<s> Hi, Has anyone checked out WeMedia's talking browser?  </s>

<s> Hi, I liked it.  </s>
<s> Control is easy, it's graphical you can easily change the  </s>

<s> It seems friendly enough for kids.  </s>

<s> Hope to take a look at it later tonight, but of course, comments from people in the "target audience" (of which I'm not) are most appreciated.  </s>
<s> In other words, if this is a browser for people with specific disabilities (limited vision or learning disabilities) I'd like to hear if it is meeting their needs -- whether or not _I_ like it is less useful to all of us.  </s>

<s> The basic "read the whole page" function can be useful, although it doesn't allow the user to navigate/control reading like a full screen reader or Home Page Reader (which are addmittely much more expensive...)

<s> I doubt that the WeMedia talking browser would be very useful for individuals with reading disabilities.  </s>
<s> There is way too much chatter and it lacks the supports that are critical to individuals with reading disabilities.  </s>
<s> Of significance, it is important for sighted users of talking browsers to read along with the spoken text.  </s>
<s> This is made possible by means of synchronized highlighting while the text is spoken.  </s>
<s> The WeMedia talking browser provides no support in this critical area.  </s>
<s> Being able to set the various reading and highlight combinations depending on individual need is also important.  </s>
<s> Also, if speech is interrupted, it seems that it cannot begin speaking where you left off.  </s>
<s> It always begins at the top of the document and reads everything.  </s>
<s> Lack of reading controls is a fatal flaw for a tool like this.  </s>
<s> You can even Tab through all of the links on a Web page, a function of the underlying MS Internet Explorer component, but this is completely disconnected from the behavior of the speech engine.  </s>
<s> Switching from Text View to the Normal View does provide those with reading disabilities with the graphics and other information that can enhance comprehension.  </s>
<s> This is useful.  </s>
<s> I suspect that WeMedia must have developed the talking browser for individuals who are blind although I am not aware of many individuals who would prefer it to a screen reader for any purpose.  </s>
<s> Perhaps libraries that are not able to offer screen readers could offer bare-bones TTS support with a tool like this - after someone lauches the application.  </s>
<s> Given the list of Channels that are provided, I suspect this may be intended as a shopping tool.  </s>
