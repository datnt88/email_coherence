<s> Then I have got some e-mails with the question "What about Danish private companies and the W3C standards?".  </s>
<s> I have now made a minor survey about this issue.  </s>
<s> I have made a test on the 250 largest Danish companies home pages.  </s>
<s> The picture is 62 % is missing the DOCTYPE-Declaration 25 % have problems with encoding Only one company did follow the W3C standard 100 %.  </s>
<s> This gives 0.4 % of all the 250 tested home pages  </s>

<s> Another interesting document I think if we publish a method and tools/templates to create such a survey, It might be possible to encourage people to do the same in their own country.  </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure  </s>
<s> for example the interop group in France would be happy to run such a survey.  </s>
<s> It might also help us to identify where the efforts are needed and it will attract the press on such results.  </s>
<s> * Is there a small group of volunteers on this mailing list to start such a guide?  </s>
<s> The thread we already had on the list will make it easier to write.  </s>
