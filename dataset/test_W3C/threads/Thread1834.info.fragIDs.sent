<s> Hi , A VCR is created (when a resourceis put under version control) along with a VR and a VHistory.  </s>
<s> VR and VH cannot be created independently (checkout and checkin only).  </s>
<s> Also a VCR will point to atmost one VR using DAV:checked-in property.  </s>
<s> Now there would be seperate VH and VR for two seperate VCR's .  </s>
<s> Could there be anyway in which two vcr's point to the same VR in a given VH ?  </s>
<s> If so , how ?  </s>
<s> eg:  </s>
<s> VH1VH2 VCR1 -- | V1 | | V1 | -- VCR2 VH3 (VCR3's VR history)  </s>
<s> V1 | -- VCR3  </s>
<s> VCR1 -- | V2 | --- VCR2 warm regards, Vikram  </s>
