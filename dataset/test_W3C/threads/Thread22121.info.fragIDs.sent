<s> We've created it to serve our repository but it might easily be skipped  </s>

<s> discussion purposes.  </s>
<s> - XPath queries should support the context supported by Xpath (the context node,  </s>
<s> a set of variable bindings, a set of namespace declarations) Method names etc should of course be changed and a clear module (something like org.w3c.dom.xpath) should be created.  </s>

<s> Yep, that's what I meant.  </s>

<s> Actually what I meant here is that the example is to start the discussion, I'm in favor of a language independent setup.  </s>

<s> We use a standard where our interfaces have a suffix If, which obviously is different from the w3c convention.  </s>

<s> (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-wg/2000Apr/0060.html, for those with Member access).  </s>
<s> Though the announcement does state it as a list for "investigating a W3C-DOM-based API for XPath", I think the above opens the door for exploration into a XPath API that addresses more than just DOM users.  </s>
<s> In the XSLT WG, in our explorations for a standard extensions interface, there has been some talk of some minimal interfaces for Nodes, lists, and trees, that do not use the DOM interfaces.  </s>
<s> While I'm not necessarily advocating this approach, it is a thought that an XPath API could exist that doesn't take DOM nodes as arguments, which would open the door to using XPath with other tree structures besides the DOM (since the DOM has become so hard and expensive to implement).  </s>
<s> I'm not trying to start trouble, only stating that we should be open to various possibilities.  </s>
<s> Certainly, one would hope that an XPath API for DOM or otherwise, should be compatible with XSLT extensions.  </s>
<s> Personally, I would hope this become a requirement for this work.  </s>

<s> That said, it would be nice if we could come up with an XPath query module for the DOM in time for Level 3.

<s> Be it in a database, in memory in dom, or written on carbon paper with a blunt knife.  </s>

<s> If I'm talking small, fast, perhaps an in-memory document is OK.  </s>
<s> If I'm talking huge, then a db would be 'best'.  </s>
