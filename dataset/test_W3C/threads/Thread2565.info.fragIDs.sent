<s> Thanks to Graham Klyne helping sort out the status of the various drafts and helping organize some of the work around it.  </s>
<s> A goal is to move content-negotiation from out of the context of being entirely HTTP-centric, and focus some of the work around that also require content 'negotiation' in its broader sense: protocol elements that describe the capabilities, characteristics and preferences of recipients, that describe the representation of entities and alternatives that a sender might send, and extensions that label additional characteristics of content that are not captured by the MIME media type.  </s>
<s> In order to ensure broad review, I am planning to ask for a BOF at the Washington IETF to see if there is reason to create a new 'content negotiation' working group on this topic, or if the current drafts can proceed to RFC without such a group.  </s>
<s> Here's a status update and proposed direction for the various drafts: draft-ietf-http-alternates-00.txt  </s>
<s> The Alternates Header Field Koen Holtman, TUE Andrew Mutz, Hewlett-Packard September 15, 1997 Target: Experimental RFC One question is whether "Alternates" might be recast as a shorthand for an existing structure, multipart/alternative, where all or all-but-one of the parts is expressed as a message/external-body; that is, map this into existing MIME semantics.  </s>
<s> (Web clients don't actually do  </s>
<s> multipart/alternative, so this doesn't really help much for the HTTP model, but it might work better for other MIME processors.) Ted Hardie &amp; Andy Mutz have been working offline on this.  </s>
<s> There is some question as to the appropriateness of the {} braces syntax, and it may yet do with a note (in pushing this forward as Experimental) that the syntax might change before this actually moves to standards track.  </s>
<s> I believe Andy's working on a new draft with Ted's help.  </s>
<s> QUESTION: Are there any objections to proceeding with this draft as an Experimental RFC?  </s>
<s> Scenarios for the Delivery of Negotiated Content using HTTP Edward Hardie, NASA NIC July 18, 1997 Target: Informational RFC Status: Drafted, comments received on HTTP list, revised Action: Will be extended to talk about other scenarios Graham Klyne is working on this one with Ted.  </s>
<s> Please review this document when the next version comes out.  </s>
<s> Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP Koen Holtman, TUE Andrew Mutz, Hewlett-Packard September 15, 1997 Target: Experimental RFC Status: Drafted, many comments received on HTTP list, revised Action: Should the Alternates header description just reference the Alternates RFC?  </s>
<s> We should be clear about the nature of the 'Experimental' status, for both Alternates and TCN in a preface.  </s>
<s> QUESTION: Are there any objections to proceeding with this draft as an Experimental RFC?  </s>
<s> HTTP Remote Variant Selection Algorithm -- RVSA/1.0 Koen Holtman, TUE Andrew Mutz, Hewlett-Packard July 28, 1997 Target: Experimental RFC Status: Drafted, comments received on HTTP list, revised Action: Reflect changes in negotation content features drafts?  </s>
<s> QUESTION: Are there any objections to proceeding with this draft as an Experimental RFC?  </s>
<s> Feature Tag Scenarios Koen Holtman, TUE July 28, 1997 Status: Drafted, comments received on HTTP list, revised Target: Informational RFC update this to include additional (non-HTTP) scenarios.  </s>
<s> Please review this draft when the next version is available.  </s>
<s> Feature Tag Registration Procedures Koen Holtman, TUE Andrew Mutz, Hewlett-Packard July 28, 1997 Target: BCP (covering just registration) Status: Drafted, comments received on HTTP list, revised.  </s>
<s> Action: This document includes both the 'registration procedure' and also the definition of some initial feature tags.  </s>
<s> These should be separated.  </s>
<s> Ted Hardie is working on this.  </s>
<s> Content Features For negotiation [based on work in draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-02.txt ] Target: Standard RFC Action: this document will include the initial feature definitions (color, size, resolution, etc.) and establish the concept of content features.  </s>
<s> It will absorb the features defined in draft-mutz-http-attributes-02.txt ("User Agent Display Attributes").  </s>
<s> Capabilities Exchange over SMTP Dan Wing Neil Joffe, Cisco Systems, Inc. August 26, 1997 Target: Standard RFC Status: This document describes a way of using content negotiation in SMTP delivery, in the case of direct connection of sender to recipient.  </s>
<s> Larry Masinter:  </s>
<s> ???  </s>
<s> The above document does not define any initial feature tags, so there is no need to work on separating them.  </s>
<s> Or am I missing something obvious here?  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> I think that was a misinterpretation of something I didn't state very clearly when I pulled together the document summary information.  </s>
<s> What my summary meant was not specific initial feature tags, but the description of the feature tag structure (name space and data types, etc.).  </s>
<s> This would include some of the material in sections 2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.8 of your original draft.  </s>
