<s> Which means that while I don't think it would be GREAT, because it is a nasty hack to cover the problems of bad clients, it wouldn't upset me either.  </s>
<s> It would be GREAT if mail clients were more helpful - the "Mail" program (mail.app) that is built into OS X is the best I have seen in this regard, and it isn't all that great.  </s>
