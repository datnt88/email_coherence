<s> 1. In the list of functions in the configuration help, it gives a function for a new file, but not a new style sheet or file from a template.  </s>
<s> Are there function names for those?  </s>
<s> (Is there somewhere in the source where all those names are listed, or I can easily find them?)  </s>
<s> 2. The configuration file gives the functions FrSpellCheck and EnSpellCheck, and I thought it should just be SpellCheck - am I confused or is the file out of date?  </s>
<s> 2.1 seems cool... 3. Is there a way of setting different key bindings for browser mode and editor mode?  </s>
<s> Is it difficult to make it read the key-bindings again (perhaps from a different file) on a command, or is this too complex to do except at startup?  </s>

<s> True.  </s>
<s> We forgot to update the list of functions in Configure.html.  </s>
<s> I updated the server version http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Configure.html New function names are "NewTemplate" and "NewCss".  </s>
<s> Right the file is out of date.  </s>
<s> The name is just "SpellCheck"  </s>
<s> It's not so easy to have that.  </s>
