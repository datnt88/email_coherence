<s> Hi Peter I am responding to some of your comment in particular: Major comment: The RDF graph is syntax.  </s>
<s> As such it makes no sense to define a notion of equality over literals, which are pieces of syntax.  </s>
<s> Peter, why do you say it makes no sense?  </s>
<s> It makes perfect sense to me.  </s>
<s> If syntax is character strings, then equality is defined by string equality; if it is some other kind of structure, then equality is defined by other means.  </s>
<s> But it is still meaningful.  </s>
<s> It is just as  </s>
<s> if one wanted to defined equality in C by defining it over pieces of a C program.  </s>
<s> Similarly, it makes no sense to define equality of nodes or triples.  </s>
<s> Again, it makes sense.  </s>
<s> It may be irrelevant or beside the point, but it is not incoherent.  </s>
<s> The new version continues to define equality over literals.  </s>
<s> I believe this is helpful and do not intend to change it, but am open to further discussion.  </s>
<s> The uses that the WG has found for such notions are: + in the test cases Without a defined notion of equality between literals, we would not have a defined notion of equality between graphs, which is necessary for the test cases.  </s>
<s> First, the new test cases working draft (of 20021112) does not even contain the string 'equal', so I don't see how a notion of equality helps in the test cases.  </s>
<s> Second, I note that the test cases working draft does, however, talk about graph isomorphism.  </s>
<s> I maintain that this notion is a *much* better notion for use here, particularly as it cannot be abused by developers and users to give cover to illegal uses of syntactic (un-)similarity as semantic (un-)similarity.  </s>
<s> Ah, that would be an incorrect reading.  </s>
<s> But the solution is to put in guard prose to warn users not to misinterpret.  </s>
<s> + in the semantics.  </s>
<s> Without clarity about the nature of the syntactic objects that the semantics are defined over, it seems difficult to know what the semantics may be about.  </s>
<s> The semantics is defined on syntactic structures sure, so it needs to know what these syntactic structures are.  </s>
<s> However, there is generally no need to know whether two syntactic structures are identical - instead all that is needed is the mapping from syntactic structures to semantic meaning.  </s>
<s> You have to get the notion of syntactic identity clear first before it even makes sense to talk about mappings.  </s>
<s> You essentially made this point yourself when you argued for talking in terms of isomorphism.  </s>
<s> Exact syntactic identity is often quite a complex matter to state these days, what with distinctions like glyphs versus characters and the impossibility of canonical character orderings in some Unicode layers and so on.  </s>
<s> Your example of a C program is uncompelling because it is usually taken as unproblematic what the underlying syntactic objects are.  </s>
<s> All programming languages have to decide whether they are case sensitive or not, which is the sort of level at which I perceive the literal equality rules.  </s>
<s> Not so, programming languages have to provide a mapping from their syntax to their semantics (however this is couched).  </s>
<s> First they have to say what their syntax actually *is*.  </s>
<s> If, for example, a programming language had case-insensitive *strings*, then the only notion of string equality it would support should be this case-insensitive one - any notion of comparing the surface syntax of strings would be meaningless for this language.  </s>
<s> Similarly, RDF should not define a notion of equality (which has strong semantic connotations  </s>
<s> Its just an English word.  </s>
<s> You are making a fuss about a matter of writing style.  </s>
<s> ) over its syntactic structures, particularly if this notion is not the same as semantic identity.  </s>
<s> If RDF needs some notion of identity for its syntactic structures, then this notion should be referred to by some other word, such as isomorphism.  </s>
<s> For me, 'isomorphism' has unfortunate connotations.  </s>
<s> I realise it is mathematically accurate; but if we took that seriously and tried to conduct this discussion in strict mathematical terms, it would rapidly become impossibly unmanageable.  </s>
<s> Ive tried it.  </s>
<s> For example, syntactic categories like 'identifier' very quickly become equivalence classes under isomorphisms.  </s>
<s> But what kind of entities are the members of those equivalence classes?  </s>
<s> They are not the members of the original classes.  </s>
<s> One has to ascend (descend?) into category-theoretic language in order to keep ones head straight.  </s>
<s> If we start telling our audience that in order to understand what an RDF graph is they have first to read Birkhoff &amp; Mclain, forget it.  </s>
