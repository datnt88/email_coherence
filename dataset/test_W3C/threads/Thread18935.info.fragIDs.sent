<s> Dear Editor, May I make a suggestion concerning the page-conformance descriptions, linked to by pages of A, AA, and AAA conformance?  </s>
<s> Readers of a conforming page will see the image link and wonder what it means.  </s>
<s> Yet, in the linked-to page, there is no brief layman's description of, e.g., "conformance level Triple-A of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0."  </s>
<s> You might, for example, have a paragraph along the lines of: "This standard is an attempt to ensure that Web pages are usable by those with disabilities, user-interface restrictions, or who are using unusual browsers.  </s>
<s> Level Triple-A is the most stringent form of the standard."  </s>
<s> One might call this an "informal summary" of the standard's purpose.  </s>
<s> Specification-speak is fine for those who are so inclined (I made my way through the spec for Algol68, after all), but it's neither inviting nor accessible to the casual reader.  </s>
<s> In fact, I would respectfully assert that the conformance specification is (unavoidably) hard for those with limited knowledge of English to understand; hence, pages like http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1AAA-Conformance are, themselves, not in compliance with Guideline 14.1, for they refer only to a complex document, offering no brief, easily-understood summary of what conformance means.  </s>

<s> This sounds like a good idea.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your suggestions!  </s>
<s> I'm on the road at the moment, but at the first opportunity will review the text in question.  </s>

<s> Done.  </s>
<s> For each of the conformance pages, I added the following miniature description: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 explain how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Conformance to these Guidelines will help make the Web more accessible to users with disabilities and will benefit all users.  </s>
