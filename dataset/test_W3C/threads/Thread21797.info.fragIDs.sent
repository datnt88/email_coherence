<s> Graham, I'm completely in a hurry but I think it is better to think of bnodes in a premis as of univars with the scope of the rule (taking care of renaming their labels).  </s>
<s> That follows from the internal ~P V C. This is actually a God's given as a resolution based backward chainer needs such rule scoped univars.  </s>
<s> For facts, skolem constants take over and it's just for bnodes in conclusions that skolems function terms are needed (function of the rule scoped univars).  </s>
<s> For a query it's the same story as for a premis.  </s>

<s> 2003-06-17 Subject: Existentials in backward chaining 02:49 PM Jos,  </s>
<s> Guido,  </s>
<s> I'm thinking about implementing a backward chaining component for my Haskell RDF toolkit, and have noticed a potential problem with existentials (bnodes).  </s>
<s> I'm intrigued how you avoid this problem.  </s>
<s> Here's my test case: Suppose we have a simple rule: ?f  </s>
<s> ex:son ?s1 .  </s>
<s> ?f ex:son ?s2 .  </s>
<s> = ?s1  </s>
<s> ex:brother ?s2 .  </s>
<s> To backward chain this requires introducing an existential: to show ex:s1 ex:brother ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> one has to show: _:f ex:son ex:s1 .  </s>
<s> _:f ex:son ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> for some _:f.  </s>
<s> Then: _:s1 ex:sister ex:d1 .  </s>
<s> _:s1 ex:brother ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> if _:f ex:son _:s1 .  </s>
<s> _:f ex:son ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> and _:s1 ex:sister _:d .  </s>
<s> but if the original goal is: _:s1 ex:sister _:f .  </s>
<s> _:s1 ex:brother ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> one might decide this is true if: _:f ex:son _:s1 .  </s>
<s> _:f ex:son ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> and _:s1 ex:sister _:f .  </s>
<s> which is problematic because if we do a simple union of the graphs we get: _:f ex:son _:s1 .  </s>
<s> _:f ex:son ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> _:s1 ex:sister _:f .  </s>
<s> or if we do a full merge (with bnode renaming): _:f1 ex:son _:s11 .  </s>
<s> _:f1 ex:son ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> _:s12 ex:sister _:f2 .  </s>
<s> neither of which are the answer we seek.  </s>
<s> What we really want to capture is: _:f1 ex:son _:s1 .  </s>
<s> _:f1 ex:son ex:s2 .  </s>
<s> _:s1 ex:sister _:f .  </s>
<s> The problem arises when the bnode introduced by backward chaining clashes with a bnode in some other part of the graph with which the antecedent will subsequently be combined.  </s>
<s> I have a plan to tackle this, but it feels a bit complicated and wondered if you have an easy strategy top avoid the problem.  </s>

<s> Hallo, I agree with Jos.  </s>
<s> I add that for a query the scope is the whole query in my system i.e. this can be more than one triple.  </s>

<s> DSL - Now only $29.95 per month!  </s>
<s> I must confess I didn't fully understand Jos' response.  </s>
<s> I certainly agree the scope of a query variable is the whole query.  </s>
<s> But does the scope ever extend beyond the query; e.g. when combining results of several queries (or proof-steps?) to continue the back-chaining process?  </s>
<s> At this stage, I think I should stop asking questions and start reading some more background material.  </s>
