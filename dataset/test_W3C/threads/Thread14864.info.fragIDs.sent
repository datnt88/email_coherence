<s> Thursday, 23 August, 20:00 UTC, 4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6 AM Australia Eastern, on +1-617-252-1038: The purpose of the meeting is to establish a process for working systematically through our list of open issues: There are several issues identified as having proposed resolutions and it might be easiest to start with those.  </s>
<s> The available options for addressing open issues include: 1. Working through the document from start to finish, addressing issues as we proceed.  </s>
<s> 2. Addressing particularly complex or contentious issues first, and then examining more detailed questions of wording and individual checkpoints.  </s>
<s> 3. A mixture of the above (in each meeting, discussing some complex issues and also disposing of a few less difficult ones).  </s>
<s> Some of the issues are already documented in the draft itself as notes for reviewers.  </s>
<s> Apart from determining how best to deal with the open issues, we should also begin the process of actually addressing them.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Something that worked well in the AU working group was to first put up issues that had a proposed resolution for instant consensus.  </s>
<s> If anyone objected to the resolution it went back on the table for the agenda, but that way we got rid of a number of issues quite fast, and could concentrate on what was more difficult.  </s>

<s> Thursday, 27 September at 20:00 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6 AM Eastern Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: The purpose of the meeting is to consider and, if appropriate, confirm the consensus items which emerged from last week and the face to face meeting, and to discuss more of the "big issues" (listed below) which were not examined at last week's meeting.  </s>
<s> These issues are: 6. Implementation (Should difficulty in implementation affect priority.) 9. Access for absolutely all?  </s>
<s> - If not, how to draw line (one suggestion was "BEST EFFORT") 10. Guidelines for all sites vs. special sites 12. Accessibility vs. usability 13.  </s>
<s> Conformance - why do it?  </s>
<s> How to test?  </s>
<s> 14.  </s>
<s> Author and user needs conflict 15.  </s>

<s> Regrets. Very brief thoughts on agenda items below.  </s>
<s> 6. Implementation (Should difficulty in implementation affect priority.) CMN: No 9. Access for absolutely all?  </s>
<s> - If not, how to draw line (one suggestion was "BEST EFFORT") CMN: If we have no techniques or success criteria then we have no checkpoint, and therefore we have not worked out how to solve problem XYZ.  </s>
<s> So we'll work on it.  </s>
<s> 10. Guidelines for all sites vs. special sites CMN: We are having enough trouble doing general guidelines and working out what is required.  </s>
<s> When we get there we should think about what are the next required steps.  </s>
<s> 12. Accessibility vs. usability CMN: If we have some kind of concept that says "thisis is essential, this is is imprtant, this is helpful" then we need not worry about whether it is accessibility or usability, just about the impact for users with disabilities.  </s>
<s> 13.  </s>
<s> Conformance - why do it?  </s>
<s> How to test?  </s>
<s> To be a W3C specification it is imortant to know if what has been done is what is specified.  </s>
<s> We should be able to provide success criteria that can be tested for each of the requirements for conformance.  </s>
<s> 14.  </s>
<s> Author and user needs conflict cmn: We describe what need to be done for users to get access to content.  </s>
<s> We shouldn't describe things that are helpful as necessary, or specify a method when we mean a problem.  </s>
<s> 15.  </s>
<s> User and user needs conflict CMN: If these arise we need to work out how to solve them.  </s>
<s> Until then, this is a red herring.  </s>
