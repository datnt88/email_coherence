<s> Chris Lilley, Brian Stell and others have been discussing the rash of irate, "get me off this list" mesages the listserv has received, lately.  </s>
<s> Well, folks: YOU CAN'T UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS LIST!  </s>
<s> I've tried for 2 months to get off this list, I've followed the rules, I've tried variations of the theme, looking for some hidden code--all to no avail.  </s>
<s> So, the last resort of those who have tried everything else is to post to the list they want to be rid of.  </s>
<s> It's irony, but it's a fact.  </s>
<s> PLEASE GET ME OFF THIS LIST@!%$#$^% Rob Wood HyperGold Web Services  </s>
<s> Well, that explains a lot!  </s>
<s> I've been trying for awhile too, and I can't seem to get off.  </s>
<s> Please! Take me off this list!  </s>
<s> And *fix* your subscribe/unsubscribe automated email list!!  </s>

<s> Please remain calm.  </s>
<s> Our automated list manager works very well.  </s>
<s> Sometimes there are problems due to: - you being subscribed under another name/address -- this was the case for the first among the two recent messages.  </s>
<s> - you being subscribed to a mail exploder in the company you work for -- this, I believe, was the case for the second person.  </s>
<s> Please talk to your sysadm about this problem -- there is nothing we can do Regards, -h&amp;kon H ?  </s>

<s> Well, after receiving a message that informed me of this, I responded with an unsubscribe e-mail with my unaliased e-mail address, and today received an automated response informing me that your software could not find my name on your list.  </s>
<s> I am very calm.  </s>
<s> I simply want off this list.  </s>

<s> "It is possible that you are on another mailing list that is sending you the www-font messages.  </s>
<s> If you're on an internal mailing list where you work, for instance, and someone subscribed that list to the www-font list, you may be getting it indirectly, in which case unsubscribing yourself will not get you off the list."  </s>
<s> Thanks for the helpful info, but I just received a message saying that I have been removed from the list.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> Because I posted my difficulties to the list.  </s>
<s> Sorry I had to burden you all with my problems, but as you can see, it worked.  </s>
