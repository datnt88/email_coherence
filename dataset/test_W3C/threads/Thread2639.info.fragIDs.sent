<s> I've been looking at use of parameters on path segments of URIs, as discussed in RFC2396 (section 3.3).  </s>
<s> As I understand it, the original reason that parameters were used, and therefore the semicolon was a reserved character, is pre-HTTP/1.1 range  </s>
<s> specification.  </s>
<s> I'm not clear on their current use, and was a bit surprised  </s>
<s> to see 2396 say that each path segment could have its own parameters, so that you could get: and so forth.  </s>
<s> If anyone could clear up the history here, I'd be grateful.  </s>
<s> With that in mind, a more HTTP-specific question: How should an origin server treat a request that includes parameters?  </s>
<s> Some trival testing suggests that current practice is to treat them as part of the path, so that an error is returned.  </s>
<s> Would it be better to have them ignore parameters that aren't understood?  </s>
<s> I suspect the answer depends on the purpose and uses of parameters, but I'm interested to get some views on this.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Mark Nottingham, Melbourne Australia  </s>
<s> Any confusion here results from equating 'URL path' to 'file path'; it need not be.  </s>
<s> Something in the server is responsible for interpreting a path - doing so as a file path is just one possibility.  </s>
<s> Exactly so.  </s>

<s> Actually, no, they were introduced in RFC 1808 long before the range hack.  </s>
<s> Before that, I'd say they were most influenced by the deisre to support versioning a la VMS.  </s>
<s> Think of it as an issue of precedence.  </s>
<s> In almost all URL parsers, the slash characters have precedence over any other character during routine parsing of components.  </s>
<s> The result is that the path is separated into path segments before anything looks at the semicolons.  </s>
<s> That is entirely dependent on the nature of the resource.  </s>
<s> A server can interpret its own namespace however it wants.  </s>
