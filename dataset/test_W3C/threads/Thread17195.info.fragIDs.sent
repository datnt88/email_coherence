<s> Hi All Before I started producing Accessible material, I developed a kiosk system, the user interface of which is a touch screen displaying a server-generated web page on a Mozilla browser.  </s>
<s> I need to re-engineer this system and would like to incorporate  </s>
<s> accessibility features where possible.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate any comments on my ideas: 1) All code to be valid XHTML with CSS formatting.  </s>
<s> 2) Menu bar - available in "normal" and "huge" icon sizes and positionable on either side of screen to cater for "handedness"; this would allow the scrolling of pages (the Dark Demon of touch screens?) by existing in a transparent layer above the displayed text.  </s>
<s> 3) Additional visitor preferences of: * Show pictures y/n * Change text size * Change language (subject to availability of translations) * Change colour schemes [black &amp; white, black &amp; gold] 4) Optional use of four physical buttons for those who find the touch screen hard to use.  </s>

<s> If anyone can suggest a working (preferably free, since this is a not-for-profit project) TTS system for Linux that's accessible through Perl and only requires a standard sound card - there's a pint of beer waiting here for you ;-)  </s>
<s> Finally, does anyone know whether it is possible to make a JavaScript mouse event emulate the tab key?  </s>

<s> If you have Mozilla embedded you could use CSS absolute positioning, and just change the style sheet to change the size...  </s>

<s> might be a good place to look for more information...  </s>
<s> will work if you keep an array of links and where you were at - for a click on anything that doesn't already have an associated onclick action.  </s>
<s> If you have a particular button to do this it should be where the onclick attribute is... (a better javascripter than I am might be more helpful here... :) cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> There are issues around touchscreens that I've yet to understand.  </s>
<s> for instance how to change focus....  </s>
<s> timing is one route ie tap for redirection, hold for tab, this way sighted users notice nothing unusual, unless they hold.  </s>
<s> but this is not a standard, so might need to be learnt.... double click may also be possible.  </s>
<s> bearing in mind that not everyone has the same idea of tap, hold or dble.  </s>
<s> alternatively: a tab button on the screen seems a reasonable possibility, who is this for?  </s>
<s> a blind person might need guidance as to where the tab key was, assuming no keyboard is provided.  </s>
<s> thanks Jonathan  </s>
<s> There is classic work at Trace.  </s>
<s> I can't tell if you are aware of this as yet.  </s>
<s> For your work, you have the luxury of adding functionality in the client.  </s>
<s> So in a sense you should be looking at software or kiosk  </s>
<s> accessibility resources, not Web Content guides.  </s>
<s> The latter are for stuff that has to play in a user-selected common denominator of WebTop Client.  </s>
<s> An example: the fundamental blind/touch mode in the EZ package of strategies is a single linear menu running up and down the left-hand margin of the touchscreen, such that if you rest your finger against the  </s>
<s> mechanical frame around the display surface you are touching the menu entries.  </s>
<s> It does rely on a small mechanical button array for things like confirm and for users with reach limitations.  </s>
<s> What is new since that work was done is that there are actually cell phones that work like this with a one-dimensional touchbar for selection.  </s>
<s> The point is that nowadays you will want to consider using one of the Device Independence single-authoring tool environments to develop your content and mode the html at the server, not entirely adapt it at the client.  </s>
<s> Plus you will have the access modes supported with browser wrinkles in the software in the kiosk.  </s>
<s> Best of luck.  </s>

<s> yes the screen was walloped and still failed to click.... few would be able to navigate, if the screen size of a link was less than 1/4 screen size.  </s>
