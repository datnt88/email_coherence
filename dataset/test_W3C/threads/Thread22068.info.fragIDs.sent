<s> Mary, Every time I try to spend time on the DOM test suite I hit the problem that  </s>
<s> the test suite build is failing for some kind of zip file.  </s>
<s> After fixing this in the build.xml  </s>
<s> by omitting these sub specs I start building a test which I then try to generate and build using the suite.  </s>
<s> The problem with that is that it takes way too long before you can debug your tests if you use the suite to generate and build it.  </s>
<s> Did you use a shortcut to generate, build and debug a simple java test ?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, jeroen X-Hive Corporation Jeroen van Rotterdam, CEO e-mail: jeroen@x-hive.com  </s>
<s> Jeroen Not sure if this is what you are looking for but I have attached some files that I use to run a single test outside the testsuite.  </s>
<s> The file trni.java is a test for traversal/range.  </s>
<s> The file getXMLDocument.java  </s>
<s> loads the file and testResults.java  </s>
<s> checks the results.  </s>

<s> Jeroen, It can be a little frustrating getting it running at first, particularly if you are trying to work in short spurts.  </s>
<s> After your framework is built, actual test generation and running should be straight-forward using the ant tasks.  </s>
<s> What problem are you having -- is it taking too long or are you getting errors?  </s>
<s> At one point, to try to figure out what was wrong, I would hand enter the transformation commands for a single test, rather than regenerating all tests.  </s>
<s> At the time, I think I created a simple script that accepted a filename and just built that particular test.  </s>
<s> I no longer have it, but could probably re-create it.  </s>
<s> Are you trying to build level 3 tests?  </s>
<s> We haven't done anything with level 3, so you might be running into problems that no one else has encountered.  </s>
<s> Could you forward a test that you are working with, or point me in the right direction, and I'll see what I can come up with.  </s>
<s> It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have an ant task that allowed you to work with just one test at a time.  </s>
