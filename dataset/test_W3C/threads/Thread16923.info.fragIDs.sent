<s> Hi Randal:  </s>
<s> What browser are you using?  </s>
<s> Are you using assistive technology like a screen reader such as Jaws?  </s>
<s> Is there a page up we can test to give you feedback?  </s>
<s> Steve  </s>
<s> IE 6 Win.  </s>
<s> I just needed to press the space bar:) Randal  </s>
<s> and commented later that the browser was IE 6 Win and that he "just needed to press the space bar:)".  </s>
<s> Some related notes: Both checkboxes and radio buttons require non-intuitive actions when used with keyboard only, which on the other hand is often needed, not only by blind people and on systems without a mouse but also by people with a motoric disability - it's difficult to hit a small box or circle with the mouse.  </s>
<s> When you have tabbed to a checkbox, the space bar indeed toggles the checkbox setting (on IE).  </s>
<s> But when you have tabbed to a radio button, the situation is quite different.  </s>
<s> You need to use arrow keys to move to another radio button in the same group, and the movement sets the button.  </s>
<s> One might expect to move with a tab from one radio button to the next field in the form (such as another radio button), just as you can move out of a checkbox, but tabbing actually takes one past the entire group of radio buttons.  </s>
<s> Besides, it seems to me that if none of the radio buttons in a group is initially selected (by virtue of a CHECKED attribute), then the group cannot be reached by tabbing at all!  </s>
<s> One more reason to always include an ininially selected (default) alternative in a set of radio buttons; for other reasons see I'm afraid browsers typically have relatively poor documentation of their usage, especially as regards to things like using keyboard only for filling out a form.  </s>
