<s> RE: [Bugtracking] Scope of domconftest  </s>
<s> From: Dimitris Dimitriadis [mailto:dimitris.dimitriadis@improve.se] Sent: Thursday, June 28, 2001 2:11 PM Subject: [Bugtracking] Scope of domconftest In order to speed up the process, I propose the following (much in line with what was previously proposed): 1. Submissions of tests are done using the www-dom-ts-sumbission@w3.org mailing list  </s>
<s> OK. Would you expect big contributions (like the initial NIST load) to be provided as a .zip or .tar.gz file with many test entries.  </s>
<s> [dd] True, this is a problem.  </s>
<s> 2. The tests are checked for correctness, validity and so forth, as they will be viewable on the W3C CVS.  </s>
<s> Control is done by the DOM TS moderators (as per the DOM TS process doc)  </s>
<s> Basically, I think that a test should be committed to the CVS as soon as it passes the initial sanity check.  </s>
<s> Committing a test to the CVS doesn't imply endorsement that the test is a "good" test just that it doesn't break the build and people can run it to make value judgements.  </s>
<s> [dd] True.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the existence of a test in a browsable CVS may entail the risk of people looking at the wrong code and using it before it is ready.  </s>
<s> The inclusion of a test into a suite definition would signify an acceptance of the test as a "good" test.  </s>
<s> [dd] Yes (as per the Process Document).  </s>
<s> 3. Tests that are not ready to form part of a suite and need work, are checked into the SF CVS and we work on them in the domconftest project  </s>
<s> I think it would be rare that more than one person would be try to collaborate on improving one test.  </s>
<s> If the W3C CVS is the test repository, having a secondary repository is distracting.  </s>
<s> [dd] given the degree to which we've debated issues at this list, I don't agree on your first sentence :) Second, yes it is distractign and we should solve this which is why we're discussing it.  </s>
<s> What do others think?  </s>
<s> If someone wants to improve or fix a test, they can checkout the W3C CVS, work on their local copy, and email the diff make to the submissions list and then Dimitris can update the W3C CVS with the patch.  </s>
<s> (Assuming Dimitris is the only one with commit access to the W3C CVS).  </s>
<s> [dd] Currently yes, but given Philippe's latest mail not necessarily.  </s>
<s> If the SourceForge CVS is used or the W3C CVS can be opened up a bit, then Dimitris doesn't have to be involved in every modification and I think the initial development would go much faster.  </s>
<s> [dd] Good point, we've had bottlenecks already.  </s>
<s> Can we subscribe to the submissions list?  </s>
<s> [dd] I think for the present Philippe and I are the only people on it.  </s>
<s> 4. Once finalized, the test goes back to the W3C machinery, where it joins the rest of the tests and makes up a test suite.  </s>
<s> 5. Documentation, compression, generation of code and so forth can be done in either case and in tierh place, we just need to take a decision.  </s>
<s> The Ant build file should file should automate the process, so anyone can recreate the entire distribution by checking out the source from the CVS.  </s>
<s> (If I've forgotten something, please add to the list) I think we should spend as little time as possible on this matter to start working.  </s>
<s> I realise we need to decide on where development will take place, but I also point out that SF was primarily thought of as a bug tracking system.  </s>
<s> Mwe should spend some postings on this topic to reach a conclusion?  </s>
<s> /Dimitris  </s>
<s> This is not a reasonable argument.  </s>
<s> Anyone pulling files from a CVS server is aware that the files may not be in a releasable state.  </s>
<s> If they want something with any expectation that it be useful, they need to locate a packaged release that isn't called "alpha" or "beta".  </s>
<s> But can just anyone subscribe?  </s>
<s> -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations  </s>
<s> Yes, even if it wasn't really obvious in the copy of the creation request: AutoSubscribe: yes -- www-dom-ts@w3.org from June 2001: www-dom-ts-submission (Was: x Thu, 05 Jul 2001 20:36:26 GMT See also http://www.w3.org/Mail/Request Philippe  </s>
<s> .zip or .tar.gz will be acceptable.  </s>
<s> You don't even need to be subscribe to the list to get them: Hum, we already have a spam in the mailing list.  </s>
<s> I'm probably going to switch to moderator mode...  </s>
<s> 3. Tests that are not ready to form part of a suite and need work, are checked into the SF CVS and we work on them in the domconftest project  </s>
<s> IMHO, tests should be put in the CVS repository.  </s>
<s> The CVS repository is not intended to provide the official test suite.  </s>
<s> Using CVS tags, it should be possible to extract only "good" tests.  </s>
<s> Read access is public so anyone can checkout and work on their local copy.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
