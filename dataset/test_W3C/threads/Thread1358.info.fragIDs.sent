<s> Attending: Peter(Merant), Boris(IBM), Geoff(Rational) Agenda: Discuss the changes proposed at the Minneapolis IETF - split Variant into separate spec (no objections so far) No objections in con-call.  </s>
<s> - merge Fork-Control into Checkout (no objections so far) No objections in con-call.  </s>
<s> - define four "feature-sets" or "option-sets" (defined in earlier message) Ok with con-call participants.  </s>
<s> - defer label header, but keep LABEL method Example of reason why you don't want human meaningful strings in a header: The Label value needs to be matched against values stored on the server.  </s>
<s> For some languages, the encoding is not enough to decide whether or not there is a match ... you need something like a language attribute.  </s>
<s> With labels in XML, that's no problem ... you add the language information as an optional element or attribute.  </s>
<s> With a header, there is no good way to provide this info.  </s>
<s> Consensus of con-call: Label header can be removed.  </s>
<s> - defer UPDATE method We spent some time discussing the motivation for this.  </s>
<s> The consensus of the con-call was that there was sufficient support for it in the working group to keep it in the protocol.  </s>
<s> - should version-controlled configurations always be in the checked-out state?  </s>
<s> One more topic was raised, which was a proposal that a version-controlled configuration should always be in the checked-out state.  </s>
<s> In particular, it would be initialized to be in the checked-out state, and that DAV:keep-checked-out is implicitly applied whenever it is checked in.  </s>
<s> The motivation for this proposal is that being "checked in" means that the state of the resource should be the same as that of the DAV:checked-in version of the resource, and that it must first be checked out before this state can be changed.  </s>
<s> But it is always possible to change the state of a version-controlled configuration,  </s>
<s> therefore it is inconsistent to ever have a version-controlled configuration in the DAV:checked-in state.  </s>
<s> The consensus of the con-call was that this change should be made.  </s>
<s> Does anyone object?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> "always possible" ?? How is that?  </s>
<s> This proposal seems predicated on a VCC being mutable, but I don't understand why that would be so.  </s>
<s> I seem them as quite immutable.  </s>

<s> A version-controlled configuration is always associated with a baseline-controlled collection (and is used to capture the state of the configuration rooted at that baseline-controlled collection).  </s>
<s> Since you can always check-out/modify/check-in the members of the baseline-controlled collection, this effectively lets you modify that membership of that baseline-controlled collection, unconstrained by the current state of the associated version-controlled configuration.  </s>
<s> In contrast a "baseline", like any other version, is always immutable.  </s>

<s> In the above description, you're modifying the baseline-controlled collection (BCC).  </s>
<s> You aren't modifying the VCC.  </s>
<s> I still see no point in putting the VCC in a permanently-checked-out state.  </s>
<s> If you're concerned about consistency between the BCC and the baseline referred to by the checked-in VCC, then the answer is to make the BCC readonly.  </s>
<s> Not to say the VCC is always checked out.  </s>
<s> Checking out the VCC would then allow the BCC to be modified.  </s>
<s> I have no opinion on whether a server can always (force) a VCC to remain checked out.  </s>
<s> But the spec should not mandate that situation.  </s>
<s> [ in Subversion, the VCC cannot be checked out and the BCC is readonly; you must use working resources to create a new baseline, all of which is then merged into the BCC and VCC ] Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> I was talking about this with somebody yesterday.  </s>
<s> I don't see the argument at all.  </s>
<s> Please give an example where a Label needs a language to resolve properly.  </s>
<s> As I see it, we compare the (character) encoded string against those on the server.  </s>
<s> "le" and "le" are exactly the same whether the language is French or English.  </s>
<s> By suggesting that there is some language component in there, you are then stating that the comparison function on the server must account for language.  </s>
<s> That just doesn't seem right.  </s>
<s> The logical mechanism is to convert the Label: header value into Unicode and compare that to all the labels stored on the server (which are also stored as Unicode).  </s>
<s> Unless/until somebody can come up with an example of a string that is encoded the same, but interpreted differently based on language, *and* argue the expectation that the server should treat that string/language pair differently... then I might agree to dropping the Label header.  </s>
<s> But until then, let's keep the Label header.  </s>
<s> Tossing it means we must replace our PROPFINDs with some silly new report and an extra round trip.  </s>
<s> Where is the benefit!?! Finally... even if you can show a similarly-encoded string which needs to also account for the language, then the Label header can simply look like: Label: my-label; language="en-us" If we want to be anal about it: But the whole language thing seems like a red herring.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> Take the word 'schon' in German, which can also be spelled 'schoen'.  </s>
<s> There is a convention that specifies that umlauts can be replaced by a following "e" and still be the same word.  </s>
<s> It is not the case that binary comparisons can be done even for equality for natural language strings.  </s>
<s> However, your point is still valid--I thought the reasons to get rid of the Label header were: * make label just a property and remove an option, simplifying the client testing problem * shorten the spec * nobody at the working group cared that much about the header * avoid the language pain in the a** with respect to internationalizing the header The language issue isn't sufficient by itself.  </s>
