<s> From:Kelly Ford [SMTP:kford@teleport.com] I hope folks will consider writing the people who run The Gap and letting them know what you think of their "strategy" to not address accessibility.  </s>
<s> [DJW:] That would just penalise them for honesty, when most commercial sites are probably the same.  </s>
<s> I'll make it ieasy to contact the gap.  </s>
<s> I wonder what their "strategy is?  </s>

<s> I have been away for a few days so this comment is late in coming.  </s>
<s> I have also had to go out and replace my waste bin as I reshaped my last one whilst kicking it round the room in frustration at some peoples' surprise over the attitude of Gap. "You can't tell where you don't show.......You can't lead where you won't go." All forms of advertising no matter the medium, are targeted.  </s>
<s> Gap have obviously decided that disabled people in general do not buy their products, so why cater to their needs?  </s>
<s> Now whilst you can argue the accuracy (or integrity) of this decision.  </s>
<s> There is no point at the moment screaming "foul play" then sitting back and doing nothing about it.  </s>
<s> Disabled people in the U.K. currently spend ?33 billion a year.  </s>
<s> (source Radar, I have no figures for the States) It is also true to say much of this money is government funded.  </s>
<s> But one hell of a lot isn't.  </s>
<s> And all of it is spent somewhere.  </s>
<s> Ten-20 realized this from the word go, the problem being ten-20 is funded by me......alone(and always will be), so development is slow.  </s>
<s> If any change is to be brought about regarding accessibility, then we need to show, not tell.  </s>
<s> Commercial decisions are based on facts, figures and educated guesstimates.  </s>
<s> We need to prove to commercial minds that disabled people are worth going that extra few bucks to accommodate.  </s>
<s> The only way is to prove it.  </s>
<s> Give them a working model.  </s>
<s> Once that is done, we may all get trampled in the rush to conform.  </s>
<s> What is more that is exactly what ten-20 intends to do.  </s>
