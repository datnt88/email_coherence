<s> The "Web", with a capital "W" is a common abbreviation for, "World  </s>
<s> Wide Web".  </s>
<s> It is a theoretical information space in which all resources (Web Resources) are identified by URIs, and can be referred  </s>
<s> to as such.  </s>
<s> On a day-to-day basis, the word "Web" is often used as a  </s>
<s> synonym for HTTP space, the space of information covered by all URIs beginning with "http://".  </s>
<s> That's my definition... Tim Berners-Lee defines it as:- World Wide Web (three words; also known as WWW) The set of all information accessible using computers and networking, each unit of information identified by a URI.  </s>
<s> ]]] - http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/glossary  </s>
<s> But note that according to the URI specification, a resource doesn't just have to be a network entity (which isn't really implied by TimBL's definition, but could be mistaken as such):- Resource A resource can be anything that has identity.  </s>
<s> Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other resources.  </s>
<s> Not all resources are network "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be considered resources.  </s>
<s> The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that mapping at any particular instance in time.  </s>
<s> Thus, a resource can remain constant even when its content---the entities to which it currently corresponds---changes over time, provided that the conceptual mapping is not changed in the process.  </s>
<s> ]]] - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt  </s>
<s> There are endless philisophical debates over what URIs, URI-Refs, resources (in URI/RDF) exactly constitute, but thankfully that doesn't stop the Web from working :-)  </s>

<s> [Semantic Web]  </s>
<s> The Semantic Web is a conceptual information space in which the resources identified by URIs can be processed by machines.  </s>
<s> It operates  </s>
<s> on the principles of "partial understanding" and "inference" (being able to infer new knowledge of terms from data that you already understand), and hence evolution and transformation.  </s>
<s> On an  </s>
<s> implementation basis, information is mostly represented as a set of triples (subject, predicate, object - similar to "noun verb object" in  </s>
<s> natural language), that allows machines to connect terms to one another.  </s>
<s> The relationships between the subjects and objects is often what gives the data its "meaning", and allows for the bootstrapping process to occur - for example "Zip in William's system is equivalent to Zip in Aaron's system, which is kinda like Postal Code in Sean's system".  </s>
<s> Because the URIs are being used to represent the resources, systems can grow on a globally decentralized basis, similar to hypertext documentation systems on the early WWW.  </s>

<s> Yep, I agree with that.  </s>
<s> Still, I think that a lot of people see "HTTP" (an perhaps FTP) as being all that the Web really has to offer... and it's the sense of "Web" that I felt WCAG using.  </s>
<s> Not essential to the definition though so yes, go with the former.  </s>

<s> I am not quite in agreement because you can do "content negotiation" while seeking a single resource.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it would seem that  </s>
<s> content is what you get back as the manifestation of a resource.  </s>
<s> I would also say that content does not include the HTTP entity header, for example.  </s>
<s> This is one reason why UAAG 1.0 equates content with the document object.  </s>

<s> This from Tim Berners-Lee [1]:  </s>
<s> "My definition of the Web is a universe of network-accessible  </s>
<s> information, and I break the "full potential" into two by looking at it first as a means of human-to-human communication, and then  </s>
<s> as a space in which software agents can, though access to a vast amount of everything which is society, science and its problems, become tools to work with us." [1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Architecture.html  </s>
<s> Tim has said that the Web is first and foremost "defined" by URIs.  </s>
<s> HTML is just another format.  </s>
<s> HTTP is just another protocol.  </s>
<s> From Web Characterization [2]: "In this context we use them to describe the information space known as the Web." [2] http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCA-terms/  </s>
<s> So, in my mind, the Web is an information space.  </s>
<s> The resources in this space are identified by URIs.  </s>
