<s> In general, government sites have to meet a higher standard of access than private sites; I am no expert, but the overall standard for private sites would be accessibility that is readily achievable.  </s>
<s> Given the nature of markup languages, it makes some sense that the standard of "readily achieveable" will be pretty high for web sites.  </s>

<s> Time will tell-but my guess is that the expectations from a legal perspective will be fairly high for sites.  </s>

<s> Kynn: "Where do rights come from, and who makes the decision, "this is a right"?"  </s>
<s> WL:: The "slogan" is without any "a" but includes it by implication so that the idea of accessibility being "the right thing" as well as being "a right" is included.  </s>
<s> The idea of "rights", at least in the U.S. is drilled into most of us  </s>
<s> humans about when we are infected with the insidious virus called "language" and in general these are taken, guarded, and maintained through the force of arms, i.e. we wage revolutions to secure them and have armed forces of various kinds to assure their application - which seems weird since one of them is to be free of such means!  </s>
<s> Anyway, there are rights given by Nature (Gaia, God, etc.) that account for our continuing through life: oxygen, water, sunlight and its products, etc.  </s>
<s> There are rights by language as in "Bill of Rights", Civil Rights, Common Law Rights, and customs.  </s>
<s> Some come from adjudication and others from power ("possession is nine points...").  </s>
<s> The main one we deal with in our context, the right to an accessible World Wide Web is less tenuous than a web but, in certain places, "guaranteed" by such  </s>
<s> legislative language as found in Title II of the ADA and parts of the  </s>
<s> Telecommunications Act.  </s>
<s> The "guarantee" is about like the one given at weddings since a lot more "parting" happens before it is done by death than it is done by decree.  </s>
<s> The "right to access" is a lot more "intuitive" than the idea that a circle with a slash across it means "no" to whatever the symbol contained in the circle means (which is also a bit less than "intuitive" in the case of arrows, etc.).  </s>
<s> I mean by that that since we are all in this together, all members of one another, and almost by definition cannot allow sociopathy to prevail, it's clear that "everything, everyone connected" means what Tim Berners-Lee et al say it means.  </s>
<s> If you speak Spanish at the poker table during a hand in most public games you are asked to stop; if you publish inaccessible materials on the Web you will be ultimately stopped - our task is to clarify "inaccessible" so that the offenders will know they are "speaking Spanish".  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>

<s> This thread has a number of errors in the discussion concerning the nature of the civil right protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  </s>
<s> Having returned from vacation, I would like to clarify the legal requirements, if I may.  </s>
<s> First, the ADA is not a protected right limited to Americans only.  </s>
<s> Although it is a US law and has within the title "Americans," the ADA (Interpretive Guidance Section 1630.1(a)) protects all qualified individuals with disabilities, regardless of their citizenship status or nationality.  </s>
<s> Enforcement is applied equally to all American businesses and entities whether or not they are operating in the US or abroad.  </s>
<s> Second, the legal standard as it applies to the internet per the USDOJ policy ruling is "effective communication" and not "readily achievable."  </s>
<s> Effective communication is a higher burden equally applicable to both business and government.  </s>
<s> The ADA standard for communications is very different from the removal of physical barriers.  </s>
<s> Effective communication under the ADA is provided through "auxiliary aids and services."  </s>
<s> An individual's request for accessible web design must be honored unless the entity can demonstrate another equally or more effective means of communication or that the request would cause a fundamental alteration or undue burden.  </s>
<s> This response is to provide legal information only and not advice.  </s>
<s> A brief summary of my law lecture at Santa Clara University School of Law Telecommunications and Technology Law class can be found at Sometimes it is forgotten that the purpose of the ADA is to prevent discrimination against people with disabilities in their access to goods, programs, services, activities or facilities.  </s>
<s> Ignorance of barriers to effective communication is no defense to the violation of this civil right.  </s>
<s> At one time people using wheelchairs were not entering buildings, not because they did not want to be there, but because there was not an accessible entrance or path of travel within the building.  </s>
<s> Effective communication requires accessible web site design that includes an accessible entrance and navigation capability.  </s>
<s> Without this civil right, the marketplace would determine consumer needs and the voice of people with disabilities would not be heard.  </s>
<s> The efforts of the WAI and other entities to enable the industry to address the removal of barriers to effective communication is certainly welcome by all of us in the disability community.  </s>
