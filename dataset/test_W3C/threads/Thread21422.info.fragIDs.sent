<s> Hi Brant, there was a bunch of client code written by Pierre Quiennec and Romain Roure last year that you could look at.  </s>
<s> It's W3C license - I'll hunt down a reference.  </s>
<s> (It's classes to put into tools - then it was integrated into an accessibility tool).  </s>

<s> the annotea client itself is in fr.essi.utils  </s>
<s> some of the stuff is for the work that it was doing - to deal with EARL processing in the tool - and some of the stuff is directly annotea functions.  </s>
<s> Cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> Interesting :) I've started looking at J2ME (MIDP 1.0 specifically) now I have a phone (Sony Ericcsson's P800) that let's me code in Java for it.  </s>
<s> Haven't got very far yet, but a few notes on it are at http://rdfweb.org/topic/FoafMobile (hmm that's mostly Symbian stuff so far).  </s>
<s> It is a wiki page (feel free to edit, in other words), and has brief section on "XML and RDF parsing on J2ME, Symbian etc" including pointers to:  </s>
<s> One goal I expect we share is finding an RDF parser that runs in a J2ME/MIDP environment.  </s>
<s> Most Java RDF parsers themselves use a separate XML parser, so I'm currently stuck at the subgoal of finding a SAX2 Java parser that works in MIDP.  </s>
<s> My best bet re RDF parser is the Rio parser shipping with Sesame, although Jena's ARP may be a possibility too.  </s>
<s> I'm curious why you've chosen J2ME rather than generic Java (J2SE I guess).  </s>
<s> Do you have mobile, geo-coding etc apps in mind?  </s>
<s> An interesting research / scoping question is to find out where the utility of Annotea-style Annotations end, and other RDF approaches should be used instead.  </s>
<s> For example, considering Restaurant reviews, you could use Annotea vocab to annotate the homepage of a restaurant.  </s>
<s> Or you could use plain RDF/XML to just describe the restaurant itself.  </s>
<s> See datasources on this front, if it's an app area that fits your goals.  </s>
<s> Or modeling styles, 'doc centric' vs 'world centric' (Annotea being largely the former I think).  </s>
<s> Hope this helps!  </s>
<s> Do keep www-annotation posted on your progress, cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> Yes, finding an RDF parser is good.  </s>
<s> So far Jena is the one I've found.  </s>
<s> I'll look at Sesame.  </s>
<s> Outside of Mozilla Help, I don't have development experience with RDF and networking and that stuff is already done in Mozilla.  </s>
<s> The primary reason for trying this in J2ME is that our instructor wants that as a "should" level goal.  </s>
<s> We can use J2SE, but it has to be pretty unique.  </s>
<s> That is, not just a networked Tic-tac-toe game.  </s>
<s> The reason we chose trying to make an Annotea client was that it might be something someone might want to do on the go, involved networking (a requirement), was not a game (a strong suggestion), hadn't been done before (in our brief research), had open source implementations for ideas, and was widely interactive.  </s>
<s> Additionally, it had a server system already created which removes that burden.  </s>

<s> We did manage a working J2SE version for annotations; however, time constratints prevented us from making a J2ME version.  </s>
<s> A J2ME version would essentially require us to rewrite the Annotea library and its dependencies to work with J2ME themselves.  </s>
