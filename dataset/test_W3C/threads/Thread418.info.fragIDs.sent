<s> Hi, I just started using your tidy tool to clean up some of the horrible HTML code that my WISYWIG editor spits out, and it really is a godsend.  </s>
<s> I have noticed something though - and I am not 100% sure if this is a bug, because I don't know how intelligent the parser is, but I have noticed that tidy does not remove redundant font specifications.  </s>
<s> The attached HTML file will illustrate what I mean.  </s>
<s> There are a bunch of fonts set one after the other (meaning that only the innermost one will actually have any effect) but the outer/redundant ones are not removed.  </s>
<s> Regards, Alfonso.  </s>

<s> Heh, I think we've been through this discussion once before ;).  </s>
<s> When I brought this issue up earlier, the general consensus was that Dave didn't have any solid algorithms for removing redundant font tags.  </s>
<s> So, after thinking this over, I volunteer to help perhaps write some pseudo code algorithms to deal with redundant font tags.  </s>

<s> tidy cleans up the document structure only, multiple redundant font tags are not a structural issue as such, and merging attributes is be somewhat tricky.  </s>
<s> If you use the -clean option, all font tags will be replaced by CSS, though you will still see multiple span tags then.  </s>

<s> Yes, Tidy isn't as smart as it could be on this.  </s>
<s> I will look at your examples and see if there is anything I could do to improve Tidy's capabilities in this regards.  </s>
