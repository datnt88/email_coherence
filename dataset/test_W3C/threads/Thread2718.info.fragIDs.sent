<s> I was looking at the header of GET request sent by Mozilla.  </s>
<s> I came across this header field "keep-alive: 300".  </s>
<s> This field is not present in the GET request sent by netscape 4.7 and IE 5.0 .  </s>
<s> One more doubt, If this field is particular to Mozilla browser, as my observation suggests, then How the server is supposed to understand this field ?  </s>

<s> No, it's not that.  </s>
<s> The pre-HTTP/1.1 persistent connection mechanism uses, Connection: Keep-Alive on the request side, and on the response side, Connection: Keep-Alive and you might also see the Apache extension, Keep-Alive: max=???; timeout=??? Mozilla is the only client I've come across which uses a Keep-Alive: header on the request side.  </s>
<s> Presumably it's a hint to the server that the client will close the connection after the specified number of seconds.  </s>
<s> I'm not entirely sure what the value of this hint is supposed to be tho'.  </s>
<s> It might be useful if the default value were less than 2*MSL, in which case it would help a busy server to decide whether leave the client to close or take the time wait hit itself.  </s>
<s> But the default seems to be 300 secs.  </s>
