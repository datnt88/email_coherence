<s> Section 2.4 of the XML-lang draft has text that says that &amp; and must be represented using the strings "&amp;amp;" and "" (sic wrt missing sentence ending punctuation) Section 4.2 discusses entity declarations in such a fashion that it does not rule out the possibility of declarations such as: I would think a user wishing to embed a " " character into this XML document would be much better served by using &amp;lessthan;, but per section 2.4, they *must* use  instead.  </s>
<s> I know we talked in the WG about whether these predeclared entity refs could be redeclared or not, but I can't find any such words in the draft spec (and I can't find any reference to a final decision on this point).  </s>
<s> What seems missing from the spec are some words that either say you cannot redefine the five special entities or words in 2.4 that say you can use different refs to get  and &amp;.  </s>
<s> Personally, I'd prefer to be able to redeclare the predeclared entities, but I could live with not being able to do this is that's the decision that's been made.  </s>
<s> Then we need to say something like "the pre-declaration of those 5 entities effectively occur before any of the markup declarations are processed so that any attempted explicit declaration of them would be superceded by the pre-declaration and would therefore have no effect."  </s>
<s> What was the decision on this and am I right that the spec needs clarification in this area?  </s>
<s> Paul Grosso's question about the five predeclared character entities suddenly brought into focus something that has been bothering me since November but hadn't until that moment come to the front of consciousness.  </s>
<s> Back in November, we were just about to include nearly 200 predefined character entities to bring XML into alignment with HTML 4.0 when Anders Berglund pointed out that the entity names for Greek scientific characters were hopelessly mixed up with the names for the other Greek characters, and we cut back to the five that are needed to escape just those characters that have uses in markup.  </s>
<s> We rationalized this by saying that all the other characters could be referred to numerically if necessary, and that in a Unicode context any scheme that conferred special status on the couple of hundred characters that Europeans happened to find especially useful was suspect anyway.  </s>
<s> What I now realize is that the same logic applies to the remaining five as well.  </s>
<s> Assuming for a moment the most likely syntax for hex character references, we will have no less than three different ways of referring to the five syntactically meaningful characters in the absence of any user definitions: QUOTATION MARK  &amp;#34; &amp;#x22; AMPERSAND &amp;amp; &amp;#38; &amp;#x26; APOSTROPHE &amp;apos; &amp;#39; &amp;#x27; LESS-THAN SIGN  &amp;#60; &amp;#x3c; GREATER-THAN SIGN  &amp;#62; &amp;#x3e; We don't need three different ways to do this.  </s>
<s> I propose that we eliminate all problems relating to the predefined character entities by simply not having any.  </s>
<s> Here are the possible counterarguments that I can think of.  </s>
<s> Objection 1: People are used to using &amp;lt, &amp;gt, etc.  </s>
<s> Response: a.  </s>
<s> They are also used to using all the other ones predefined in HTML but not predefined in XML. b.  </s>
<s> They are used to using them without trailing semicolons under some  </s>
<s> circumstances; we don't allow that.  </s>
<s> Objection 2: The names quot, amp, apos, lt, and gt are significantly shorter than the corresponding numeric forms.  </s>
<s> Oops, no they're not.  </s>
<s> Forget that one.  </s>
<s> Objection 3: The names quot, amp, apos, lt, and gt are significantly easier to remember than the corresponding numeric forms.  </s>
<s> Response: Easier for people whose native language is other than English, i.e., most of humanity?  </s>
<s> I don't think so.  </s>
<s> In return for not predefining character entities we get the following benefits: 1. Language neutrality.  </s>
<s> 2. Cleaner specification.  </s>
<s> 3. Zero incursion into the user's name space for character entities.  </s>
<s> 4. Elimination of nitty objections to the names apos and quot (which we haven't talked about much but are out there).  </s>
<s> 5. Elimination of all other issues relating to predefined character entities (such as the one that Paul raised).  </s>

<s> For those who know HTML, or almost any SGML DTD, they are.  </s>
<s> Besides, it is a false dichtomy: those more comfortable with numbers can use numbers.  </s>
<s> Overrated.  </s>
<s> What's the Japanese for " !ELEMENT" and why did we choose not to allow it?  </s>
<s> Why not redefine that to a number also?  </s>
<s> !23 gi (#43)+  </s>
<s> I heard this argument for the reason why OS/2 formatted floppies would report "SYSTEM ERROR: 32341" if they weren't bootable: if it isn't going to be a meaningful error message for everyone, it shouldn't be meaningful for anyone.  </s>
<s> I don't buy it.  </s>
<s> A little, but not, in my opinion worth the cost.  </s>
<s> Who wants to override  and ?  </s>
<s> I think that anyone who does so is making a mistake, whether they are English speaking or not.  </s>
<s> It's like using "IF" as a variable name in languages that allow it: no matter what your native language you are just asking for confusions with the keyword IF and the convention that "IF" means "conditional" no matter what your native language is.  </s>
<s> Many programming languages invented by non-English speakers use the conventional keywords -- they are magic strings -- like "car" and "cdr" in Lisp.  </s>
<s> They were meaningful to a particular set of people at a particular time and it doesn't make sense to change them now.  </s>
<s> Calling them numbers would not have helped.  </s>
<s> I'm not as tied to those names as to , &amp;amp; and to a lesser extent  </s>
<s> For the usability cost for those familiar with HTML and other DTDs, I would rather just solve the issues.  </s>

<s> The number of people who are familiar with *anything* now is insignificant compared to the number of people who will be working with these languages five years from now.  </s>
<s> Apples and oranges.  </s>
<s> " !ELEMENT" occurs n times per DTD; &amp;amp; occurs m times per instance.  </s>
<s> Remember that XML is designed primarily for delivery; the typical delivery scenario is one in which there is no DTD at all.  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> If current trends continue, the majority of them will be English speakers, though not necessarily native English speakers.  </s>
<s> That isn't an argument for language bigotry, but for suggesting that it *may* still be more intuitive to most page authors five years from now than (seemingly random) numbers.  </s>
<s> Anyhow, five years from now is a LONG TIME.  </s>
<s> What do we know about five years from now: do they still edit XML text by hand?  </s>
<s> Do they still use a few, standard DTDs, written in English?  </s>
<s> Do people write their own DTDs in their own languages but continue to use the  and  conventions because they are so universal?  </s>
<s> Did Unicode actually take off?  </s>
<s> Are programmers the only people who see "raw" XML code?  </s>
<s> Okay then, what do ?XML ?  </s>
<s> "version" CDATA DOCTYPE RMD mean if I'm not an English speaker?  </s>
<s> Why are these funny double-tick mark ("") characters special?  </s>
<s> How do I know that they start and end a string?  </s>
<s> Once again, I'm not advocating that anyone be forced to use , but that it be made easy for the majority of us now, and potentially in 5 years, who are either familiar with the convention or are English speakers (native or not).  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> If people should not be asked to pay ISO for an expensive standard, they surely should not have to buy a Unicode book to look up these numbers -- this to whoever suggested "simply flipping to the page of the Unicode book" to decipher the number.  </s>
