<s> I was looking over XSD again.  </s>
<s> It seems to me as though the recommendation to use XSD within RDF raises more questions than we have currently been considering.  </s>
<s> IMO, it may knock us off target (and probably should).  </s>
<s> I have begun working on what I think would be a set of answers ... See: or maybe (the supposedly equal) (I have a stylesheet issue - in the tables red text may only come out in purple with a strikethrough, whereas the green text comes out in purple without the strikethrough).  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Excellent summary, Jeremy.  </s>
<s> And this definitely touches on my concerns about the basis being used for certain entailment tests involving relations between datatypes -- as to where those relationships are defined and whether those relationships sync with the RDF definition for rdfs:Datatype.  </s>
<s> My impression is that while there is evidently a problem with equality in XML Schema  </s>
<s> simple datatypes, it is not per se a problem with RDF Datatyping.  </s>
<s> I.e., it should be sufficient to (a) note the problems in XML Schema and (b) submit  </s>
<s> suggestions to the XML Schema WG, but I don't see how this impacts the current RDF datatyping model.  </s>
<s> If XML Schema says that xsd:float and xsd:decimal have disjunct value spaces, we may wish to disagree and consider that a bug, but that doesn't affect how those datatypes are modeled in RDF.  </s>
<s> It simply means that the assertion xsd:decimal rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal .  </s>
<s> (and/or visa versa) is (possibly) in conflict with the XML Schema spec.  </s>
<s> So what.  </s>
<s> That's not RDF's problem and RDF is not creating the problem.  </s>
<s> If the XML Schema spec says "1.0"^^xsd:decimal != "1.0"^^xsd.float  </s>
<s> (and my understanding is that it does say this) then applications should respect that if they are using those datatypes.  </s>
<s> If the XML Schema datatype relations are either broken or ill defined, then fix them.  </s>
<s> The RDF datatyping model is then providing a benefit to the XML community by shining a light on the problem.  </s>
<s> Eh?  </s>
<s> Patrick [Patrick Stickler, Nokia/Finland, (+358 40) 801 9690, patrick.stickler@nokia.com]  </s>
<s> yes. Sorta.  </s>
<s> I'll take your word for it there is a problem with XML Schema  </s>
<s> datatypes, but I'd rather we focussed our attention and efforts on the RDF issues we have.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Oh I hope that's a type.  </s>
<s> If Schema doesn't agree to that we are in trouble.  </s>
<s> Did you mean something like xsd:integer rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal .  </s>
<s> YES.  </s>
<s> I think this is a good approach.  </s>
<s> I think I find myself agreeing strongly with Patrick here.  </s>
<s> We need to balance two things: o getting finished o making sure we don't ignore signs of serious problems My interpretation of where we are at is: o We have a datatyping model for RDF o There are some subtlties of specific schema datatypes that we have not yet worked out but they do not call the general model into question.  </s>
<s> As Patrick, says whether xsd:float is a subclass of xsd:double is a matter for the xsd guys to define.  </s>
<s> o I'm sympathetic to us having worked this stuff out in some detail for xsd datatypes to check that there are no hidden gotchas, but I think that may take some time and need us to work with xml schema folks.  </s>
<s> o I suggest: - we use non controversial examples of schema datatypes in our test cases - stay away from the stuff that tests understanding of schema datatypes more than rdf  </s>
<s> - we propose through the coordination group the writing of note jointly by folks from rdfcore and xml schema datatypes which defines the RDF schema for XML Schema datatypes.  </s>
<s> - that we write that note after last call and before proposed rec Comments?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> As I explained earlier, I disagree with shying away from contraversial issues that are relevant to our design, i.e. keeping them out of the test suite.  </s>
<s> If we're shy about these issues, let's get them out of our design; c.f. rdfs:format  </s>

<s> This has nothing to do with our design, but with ambiguity in  </s>

<s> I read them as saying that the  </s>
<s> following assertions are not licensed:  </s>
<s> xsd:decimal rdfs:subClassOf xsd:float .  </s>
<s> xsd:float rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal .  </s>
<s> i.e. "10.0"^^xsd:float != "10.0"^^xsd:decimal and if we're going to have test cases for the above, they should be negative entailment tests, since IMO XML Schema doesn't license the datatype entailment IF thing:A some:Property "10.0"^^xsd:float .  </s>
<s> thing:B some:Property "10.0"^^xsd:decimal .  </s>
<s> THEN thing:A some:Property _:x .  </s>
<s> thing:B some:Property _:x .  </s>
<s> It is NOT the duty of the RDF Core WG to resolve the above ambiguity or fix XML Schema datatypes so that applications can fairly consider that "10.0"^^xsd:float == "10.0"^^xsd:decimal, even if it is relevant to the RDF community.  </s>
<s> This seems more like an issue for the SW Coord.  </s>
<s> Group or the TAG to resolve.  </s>
<s> It is IMO enough if we simply say somewhere "here be dragons".  </s>
<s> Surely you're not proposing we throw out the typed literals and go only with lexical constraints?! Again, this has nothing to do with the RDF design.  </s>
<s> In fact, the present datatyping solution provided by RDF is helping the XML community by shining a light on these problemmatic issues and "encouraging" the XML Schema folks to fix them.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> This isn't true, because 0.1 does NOT occur in the xsd:float value space.  </s>
<s> (it's 2^-1 .  </s>
<s> 5^-1)  </s>
<s> This is true if floats and decimal value spaces are just sets of numbers, as Jeremy described.  </s>

<s> I think you are missing the critical point here.  </s>
<s> And that is that the XML Schema specs say that *NEITHER* of the above are true.  </s>
<s> Whether one might argue that the latter is true or not is completely beside the point insofar as the RDF Core WG is concerned.  </s>
<s> We do  </s>

<s> We have provided a datatyping solution  </s>

<s> Such usage can and should respect that there is no defined intersection of values between xsd:float and xsd:decimal.  </s>
<s> If folks want to ensure that xsd:float rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal . is true in the XML Schema specs, then that should happen in/with the XML Schema WG.  </s>

<s> DanC claimed that they did, at the last telecon - remember "WHERE are the WORDS?!" :-)  </s>

<s> Well, I would say that there are no words whatsoever defining any subtype relation between xsd:float and xsd:decimal -- and so the question then is "where are the words" that define such a relation.  </s>
<s> The reality is that neither can be a subtype of the other because both have values in their value spaces which don't occur in the others.  </s>
<s> Whether or not their value spaces intersect, is still an open question.  </s>
<s> I think that anyone with half a clue would presume that they do in fact intersect -- and that if the specs suggest they don't that they should be fixed -- but the ambiguity is there.  </s>
<s> I fully agree, and we should do that, and move on.  </s>
<s> And when moving on, avoid the controversial areas of XML Schema datatypes by using examples where there is clear derivation defined by the XML Schema spec.  </s>
