<s> 10.1 - Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user.  </s>
<s> Priority 2  </s>
<s> Given that user agents now DO ALLOW users to turn off spawned windows (eg Opera 7) is this checkpoint met when a new window is spawned  </s>
<s> provided that the user is informed (eg as a TITLE="This link opens in a new window" attr in the A tag and information placed to the right of the link on screen)?  </s>
<s> REASON we are aiming for AA compliance and together with PDF content with no text alternative (checkpoint 1.1), 10.1 is the only other barrier.  </s>
<s> I've been through the w3.org accessibility mail list and the question of accessible PDFs is not answered with any clear authority.  </s>
<s> The following site http://hnb.dhs.vic.gov.au/ds/disabilitysite.nsf/pages/aboutsite#awd  </s>
<s> claims AAA conformance having PDFs with no text alternative - is the "qualification" provided in the above link valid (written by a member of the WAI Accessibility Guidelines working group)?  </s>
<s> If we were to ape their information provided and functionality could we likewise make the same claim to conformance to 1.1?  </s>

<s> If you decide (and there is no decision yet from the working group, so you have to decide for yourself or ask someone to decide for you) that user agents do allow this, then you can open pop-up windows without informing the user.  </s>
<s> In my opinion you should not do it without informing the user anyway.  </s>
<s> I prefer the information to be visible, for reasons I argued already this week on this list.  </s>
<s> Which mailing list did you go through?  </s>
<s> W3C maintains a lot of them.  </s>
<s> With all due respect to Gian (or whoever wrote the text that is on that site), I think the interpretation you refer to is wrong.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints don't over-ride each other, they are atomic requirements.  </s>
<s> If one is not met, then the content cannot sensibly claim to be in conformance with WCAG triple-A (since that is defined as meeting every checkpoint).  </s>
<s> For example the fact that DHS chooses to use a product which apparently does not allow them to meet a checkpoint means they cannot meet the checkpoint, not that they can claim they do because it is someone else's fault.  </s>
<s> (This isn't an accessibility question, its a basic logic question).  </s>
<s> For PDF, if the thing can be transformed to HTML of the required accessibility level using an automatic translation, and you provide a link to that service, then it clearly meets the requirements.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't then the assessment is a whole separate piece of work.  </s>
<s> (Of course if it can be transformed and you have done that to test its accessibility, why not also make the HTML version available - PDF is great for printing, but dreadful for online use in many people's opinions).  </s>

<s> * (eg Opera 7) is this checkpoint met when a new window is spawned This is not currently true, as conditions are not supposed to be satisfied by the presence of one minority browser with the feature.  </s>
<s> However, if Internet Explorer were to have had this feature for a few years, this might be sufficient without any warnings.  </s>
<s> There is no requirement in HTML that TITLE should be presented in a way that is useful in this context, and this would be a misuse of title, even if it were.  </s>
<s> TITLE is not "present as tooltip".  </s>
<s> Note that the implication of browsers that allow spawned windows to be disabled is that you must design on the basis that the feature will be disabled.  </s>
<s> I'm not quite sure how Mozilla handles this with scripted popups, but my guess is, even allowing for the issues to do with scripting, that any popup blocked this way will be a dead link, as one use of this feature is to tame Geocities hosted sites.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, as I read the clause, warnings are only a let out if the target window already exists, not if you create a new window for one.  </s>
