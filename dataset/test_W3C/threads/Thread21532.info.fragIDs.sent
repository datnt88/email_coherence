<s> Hello Henrik (and others if you wish to help): Can you help me find a (first name, last name) name - made up, of course - which has all the "peculiar" characters of the Scandanavian languages, both Danish and Swedish, and if need be, Norwegian.  </s>
<s> You know the sort of things I mean: the ones with o's crossed out, circles above letters, ...the whole works.  </s>
<s> It need not be something you'd want to name your children, just hypothetical.  </s>
<s> I am making the SOAP Primer more international in flavour - that was one of the last call comments - hence the desire to change the name "John Q. Public" to something that exercises the Unicode!  </s>
<s> Thanks Nilo  </s>

<s> S?rensen Of course this requires no more than latin-1.  </s>

<s> Thanks, Henrik.  </s>
<s> Shortly after sending you the email, the same though DID occur to me - I am a bit slow, I'm afraid - and I came up with ?ke  </s>
<s> J?gvan ?yvind which covers Iceland, as well.  </s>
<s> It has the greater likelihood of not being anyone's real name, methinks.  </s>
