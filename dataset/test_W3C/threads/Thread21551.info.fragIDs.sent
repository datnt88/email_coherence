<s> On the issue of issue 221 on PIs [1], I started writing up the four possible solutions that have been brought up in the editors' discussion to date.  </s>
<s> The list was a result of discussion with Noah and Gudge and generally an output of the various email threads.  </s>
<s> However, looking through the discussion threads, the WG resolution agreed upon the following resolution [2] on Sep 4 which happened as a result of a call for clarification of the initial resolution coming out of the f2f: Except in the special case of intermediaries (see below), envelopes transmitted by SOAP senders MUST NOT contain PIs.  </s>
<s> Receivers (including intermediaries) receiving an envelope with a PI SHOULD fault with a Sender fault.  </s>
<s> However, in the case where performance considerations make it impractical for an intermediary to detect PIs in a message to be relayed, such intermediaries MAY leave the PIs unchanged in the relayed message.  </s>
<s> Given that nobody has raised WG objections to this resolution, I am at a loss as to why we as editors don't just incorporate the resolution.  </s>
<s> At this point in time, if either of us can't live with the resolution then we should raise an objection at the WG level but this would be outside the scope of our editorial role.  </s>
<s> Any reason not just to use the text above?  </s>

<s> I prefer the following that Noah and I discussed in one of the email threads.  </s>
<s> It preserves the resolution semantices but uses the same terminology as the rest of the spec (e.g. SOAP receiver instead of Receiver, PIII instead of PIs) and reads better IMHO:  </s>
<s> "SOAP messages sent by initial SOAP senders MUST NOT contain processing instruction information items.  </s>
<s> SOAP intermediaries MUST NOT insert processing instruction information items in SOAP messages they relay.  </s>
<s> SOAP receivers receiving a SOAP message containing a processing instruction information item SHOULD generate a SOAP fault with the Value of Code set to "env:Sender".  </s>
<s> However, in the case where performance considerations make it impractical for an intermediary to detect processing instruction information items in a message to be relayed, such intermediaries MAY leave the processing instruction information items unchanged in the relayed message."  </s>

<s> From an editorial POW, I am fine with this reformulation and if we all think this is within the realm of editorial discretion then we should just do it.  </s>

<s> Fine with me.  </s>
<s> It was always my my understanding that the following was offered for exactly the purpose to which we're about to apply it: I.e. as the editors' embodiment of the F2F decision.  </s>
<s> So, I'm happy to proceed with this.  </s>
<s> I think the earlier concerns may have come from Jean-Jacques and/or Gudge.  </s>
<s> If they're OK, I'd say we send a note to the WG indicating something along the lines of: "We editors were asked to implement the F2F decision on 221.  </s>
<s> For some time we had trouble getting concensus among the editors and accordingly picked up a to do to offer alternatives to the WG.  </s>
<s> The editors have no in fact reached concensus on the following text.  </s>
<s> Accordingly, since the only reason for consulting the WG was to get their assistance in gaining concensus.  </s>
<s> we are checking in this text and closing the issue in our list.  </s>
<s> If this is not acceptable, please alert us ASAP (and of course, we can always revert the text if necessary.)  </s>
<s> That way we can just do it and move on, I think.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
