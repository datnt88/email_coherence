<s> First I must say that we greatly appreciate Tidy and, as best as I can enforce it, we use it to clean up the pages of MathSciNet from the Math Society.  </s>
<s> I hesitate to call this a bug but Tidy is doing bad by some bad html from Frontpage 4.0.  </s>
<s> Tidy throws away a name-anchor when it is represented as:  </s>
<s> P A NAME="clipboard" H3 Clipboard /H3 /A P "  </s>
<s> That becomes " H3 Clipboard /H3 ".  </s>
<s> I'm running as new a version as I could easily find.  </s>
<s> For completeness I'm including a) how it runs, b) the test input file and c) the output file.  </s>

<s> appears to be HTML 4.01 Transitional 3 warnings/errors were found!  </s>
<s> b) A fragment of htmp created by Frontpage..... lots more stuff deleted.... c) output file A fragment of htmp created by Frontpage.....  </s>

<s> Hm, Tidy 7th July 1999: This is what you want and what is the right thing to do.  </s>
<s> Seems, that there were some changes for inline/blocklevel wrapping.  </s>

<s> It's a bug alright!  </s>
<s> P A NAME="clipboard" H3 Clipboard /H3 /A P "  </s>
<s> I have fixed this and the result is now: when tidying to XHTML.  </s>
<s> The br's are produced as a consequence of finding the two empty P 's. n.b. P can't contain h3 .  </s>
<s> The fix will be included in the next release of Tidy.  </s>
<s> Many thanks for reporting this bug.  </s>
