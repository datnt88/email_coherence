<s> The regular WCAG meetings will resume next week.  </s>
<s> I guess this is because of Thanksgiving?  </s>
<s> The US is the only country who celebrates Thanksgiving, as far as I know.  </s>
<s> Does this mean that if the US has a holiday, the meeting is cancelled by default?  </s>
<s> How many countries have to celebrate a holiday before a meeting is cancelled?  </s>
<s> Or is it because the conference bridge is located in the US?  </s>
<s> Since this is an international newsgroup I would appreciate it if meetings that are cancelled because of holidays somewhere in the world would be announced a bit earlier.  </s>
<s> If I hadn't had to cancel, I would not have known there was no meeting tonight and would have called in for nothing and wondered what was happening.  </s>
<s> For you Americans out there: Enjoy the holiday!  </s>

<s> Hi Yvette, It is not at all unusual for the meeting to be cancelled right after a face-to-face, especially when some members are still traveling back home.  </s>
<s> Also, I think you will find that the working group would cancel the call for any holiday or event that caused a large portion of the working group to not be present.  </s>
<s> This one was cancelled because of the percentage of regular members who would not be able to attend.  </s>
