<s> As of this fall, we hope to have it integrated with the AMIS project (new  </s>

<s> DA is no longer "supported" by MS though - You could currently build an interface to a WMP player that could control speed - I've done one with audio.  </s>

<s> There will soon be a third addition in the hardware player category (Telex).  </s>
<s> These are all solid consumer products that have been implemented internationally.  </s>
<s> It might be worth noting that speed control is a feature of SMIL playback capabilities, as the DAISY format uses SMIL to represent synchronzed multimedia types.  </s>
