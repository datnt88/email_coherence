<s> Chaps, After discussion with Deborah I have uploaded another version of Martin's comments.  </s>
<s> Let's try to publish this on Thursday.  </s>
<s> Please send in any other comments asap, then we'll have a final discussion during the meeting tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Cheers, RI Richard Ishida W3C contact info: http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/ W3C Internationalization FAQs RSS feed: http://www.w3.org/International/questions.rss  </s>
<s> still limping without a disk... so hard to write- here are a few comments.  </s>
<s> It is very good, mostly editorial nits. 1) Can Question be more succint?  </s>
<s> I dont think "removing" is needed it is implied.  </s>
<s> Perhaps change: When I'm using a UTF-8 encoding, why does an extra line appear at the top of my web page in some user agents, and how do I remove it?  </s>
<s> to Why do utf-8 encoded pages show extra lines at the top?  </s>
<s> 2) Suggested changes to answer section, para by para- a) Perhaps Change- This may be caused by the presence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file that the user agent doesn't recognize.  </s>
<s> Note that a number of more recent browsers, such as the latest Windows-based versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla (Netscape) and Opera, do not exhibit this behaviour.  </s>
<s> to: Some user agents do not (yet) treat the UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file properly.  </s>
<s> Many of the more recent browsers, such as the latest Windows-based versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla (Netscape) and Opera, do process the UTF-8 signature correctly.  </s>
<s> (should we say "windows-based"?  </s>
<s> for Mozilla and Opera it is probably true for other platforms.) b) For the next para, perhaps after "manually" add "with an editor".  </s>
<s> In second sentence perhaps change "can remove" to "automate removal of": To remove the extra line or spaces that appear in the browser, remove the bytes that represent the UTF-8 signature.  </s>
<s> You can remove them manually or with a script.  </s>
<s> One of the benefits of using a script is that you can remove the signature from multiple files.  </s>
<s> c) For next para, I would change "cause of extra line..." to "UTF-8 signature".  </s>
<s> Also, we should include the other way to remove bom- An editor that is bom-aware might have an option to save without the bom.  </s>
<s> So you might not need to edit it, just open and save correctly.  </s>
<s> You may not be able to see the cause of the extra line or space in your editor, if it handles the UTF-8 signature correctly.  </s>
<s> An editor which does not handle the UTF-8 signature correctly displays the bytes that compose that signature according to its own character encoding setting.  </s>
<s> With the Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1) character encoding, the signature displays as extraneous characters ???.  </s>
<s> With a binary editor capable of displaying the hexadecimal byte values in the file, the UTF-8 signature displays as EF BB BF. d) next para is fine, but I would move "thoroughly" after "signature.  </s>
<s> Also instead of "but that" use "but note that only", and add to the end something like ", so look specifically for some of these chars to check."  </s>
<s> You should check thoroughly the result of removing the signature, bearing in mind that pages with a high proportion of Latin characters may look correct superficially but that characters outside the ASCII range (U+0000 to U+007F) may be incorrectly encoded.  </s>
<s> If there is no evidence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file, then your problem lies elsewhere.  </s>
<s> e) For the following para- how do we mean "include"?  </s>
<s> Also, if embedded in the middle of the file it is likely going to display as something other than blank lines, no?  </s>
<s> Note that if you include text from a separate file that has a UTF-8 signature at the top you may find blank lines appearing within the page, rather than just at the top.  </s>

<s> Also textpad doesn't always add BOM.  </s>
<s> There is a configuration option which specifies whether to add or not add the bom.  </s>
<s> You can turn it off.  </s>
<s> On Tue, 25 Nov 2003 17:49:19 -0000  </s>
<s> Just a few more comments: In the question: "a UTF-8 encoding": How many UTF-8 encodings are there?  </s>
<s> "You should check thoroughly the result of removing the signature"...: This seems to be a general issue about checking whether UTF-8 is really UTF-8, not really related to the BOM.  </s>
<s> Better say so.  </s>
<s> "If there is no evidence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file, then your problem lies elsewhere.":  </s>
<s> Is that something that appears frequently?  </s>
<s> If not, maybe leave this out.  </s>
<s> If yes, better give some other possible causes.  </s>
<s> I guess we could leave this out.  </s>
<s> The background mentions things such as 'BOM'.  </s>
<s> This is okay.  </s>
<s> But I'm affraid there are quite a few readers who know this thing as 'BOM', so it would help to add "('BOM')" after "UTF-8 signature" in the first paragraph of the answer.  </s>
<s> "Each character in the file is represented by 2 to 4 bytes of data": changing '2 to 4' to '2 or 4' will be more precise.  </s>
<s> 3 bytes isn't an option of UTF-16 or UTF-32.  </s>
<s> I think we were talking about taking Helios Textpad out (because it's UTF-8/i18n support is currently marginal).  </s>
<s> Or was this in another context?  </s>
<s> "Microsoft documentation about the Byte Order" - "Microsoft documentation about the Byte Order Mark" Why is there a link to Apache Content Negotiation?  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
