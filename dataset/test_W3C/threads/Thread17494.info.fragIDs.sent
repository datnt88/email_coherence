<s> YES! That is what I meant by adding more skip links.  </s>
<s> If the floated section is small enough to view the rest of the main article, hidden links are fine.  </s>
<s> But, if you are going to jump to a section off the current display, but still on the same page, visible links would be encouraged so that those with graphical browsers but no mouse could easily jump to the section not currently displayed.  </s>
<s> -Steve Nick Kew said:  </s>
<s> Alternatively, you could have kept the main story together and made the "standards" and "commerce" stories occur after the main story in the HTML but use CSS to position them.  </s>
<s> This would avoid the need for the skip link and header navigation would work well.  </s>
<s> AWK  </s>
<s> What you don't want to do though is write generic links if you have multiple stories on the same page that could be come repetitious so you need a mechanism that puts the title of the story that is being continued in the body of the link such as continue with bush sells out america instead of continue story.  </s>

<s> Yes Andrew, I forgot to mention that about CSS and linearization.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> But watch out for your tab indexing when using CSS positioning.  </s>
<s> Just check that it doesnt get rendered in a way that is not obvious.  </s>
<s> Andrew Kirkpatrick said:  </s>
<s> Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's not really an option for insets.  </s>
<s> CSS float relies on the floated content appearing before what floats around it, while fixed or absolute positioning precludes the main story flowing around any kind of inset, and suffers from rather a lot of buggy implementations.  </s>

<s> Not satisfied with "this should work, in theory"?  </s>
<s> Yes, there are lots of buggy CSS implementations.  </s>

<s> Ha! I'm happy to say that my parents didn't name me after a programming language.  </s>

<s> AWK  </s>
<s> It strikes me that Nick uncovered an excellent example of where HTML/CSS theory conflicts with good accessibility for non-visual UAs.  </s>
<s> Using float is a key principle of CSS, but as mentioned it relies totally on intermixing the two content streams in a manner that is inconsistent with separating presentation and structure.  </s>
<s> Thinking back to my design for print days, there was no need to insert a sub-story into the main story flow in Quark or PageMaker in order to create the text-wrapped display that float replicates.  </s>
<s> The two stories remained whole and separate regardless of how they were streamed onto the page.  </s>
<s> Both PageMaker and Quark support text-flowing models that allow the story to be displayed in discontiguous blocks on the page while remaining part of complete threads internally.  </s>
<s> The issue raised originally is real, and absolute or relative CSS positioning cannot replicate the design function of floats.  </s>
<s> This is why CSS has floats :)  </s>
<s> The solution would need to be implementing the same sort of sophisticated box and story handling models in CSS that print designers enjoy in DTP  </s>
<s> applications.  </s>
<s> Physical positioning is only part of the story, something I had overlooked until Nick's post.  </s>
<s> In CSS, we should be able to define display boxes and link them to story threads in the HTML source.  </s>
<s> The browser would be responsible for dynamically flowing the story into its boxes depending on local settings like window size and font properties.  </s>
<s> Maybe in CSS8?  </s>
<s> :) Thought provoking stuff.  </s>
<s> The bottom line is you either compromise the design or the HTML structure if you want to do this kind of DTP-style layout in todays browsers.  </s>
<s> Take care Ian Anderson zStudio  </s>
<s> PDF, since long before tagged PDF, has had the ability to represent this sort of structure, even if I've never been aware of it being used in anger.  </s>
<s> Each contigous chunk is called a bead and and the whole article a thread.  </s>
<s> I don't know how well the reader handles this as I've never found such a document.  </s>
<s> Whilst there are moves towards intrinsic multi-column layout, there are a couple of problems that CSS has that DTP doesn't have: - it has incremental rendering with minimal backtracking as a desirable design aim (even if most web pages use auto table layout, that frustrates this); - it doesn't have the human layout designer there to tweak things to work well, which is necessary to avoid completely empty columns, etc. if a radically different font size is used.  </s>
<s> I more and more think that the tagged PDF model is a better model for what most designers want to do and they way they seem to think; you create a hard page description in presentational form, then annotate it with the structure, rather than creating the structure and annotating it with soft layout rules.  </s>
<s> Of course, with tagged PDF, if you are not in the primary audience, that can appreciate the graphic design, you are at the mercy of the tagger.  </s>
