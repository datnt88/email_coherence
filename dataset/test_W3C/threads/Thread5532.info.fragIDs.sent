<s> ...Please review the format (headings) at www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg and reply to this list: __ NOT APPROVE, because of the following objections): The headings are almost there and my objections are minor, but would like to have them addressed before approving: 1.  </s>
<s> I think "Announcements &amp; Meetings" should be split into two h2 level headings.  </s>
<s> Announcements and meetings are both important enough to be on a higher level, and I think it would make the content clearer.  </s>
<s> It would also avoid the grammatically incorrect use of the ampersand.  </s>
<s> 2. If we have a possible "Related Pages" h2 , then shouldn't the possible "Page Contents" also be an h2 ?  </s>
<s> 3. The title of the working group is the only h1 .  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> Why isn't it just a title (with an appropriate CSS class for the title)?  </s>
<s> I understand headers to be divisions in the content, not the title of the content.  </s>
<s> That's what headers/headers/subheads are in newspapers.  </s>
<s> Is it done differently on the Web?  </s>

<s> approve/disapprove.  </s>
<s> Depending on what other WSTF member comment, maybe it would be best to discuss the working group pages at our next WTSF meeting rather than being in such a hurry.  </s>
<s> I think we could discuss tweaks such as link text - ex. "Minutes from previous meetings are available" could be just "Minutes from previous meetings" or "Previous meeting minutes".  </s>
<s> Beyond objections: I like the "Additional Information" header and that it is the last header.  </s>
<s> This provides flexibility for each of the WGs while still having consistency throughout the WG pages.  </s>

<s> of this week This Thursday is a deadline for materials for W3C Advisory Committe review.  </s>
<s> We are updating the format of the current working group pages to be more consistent.  </s>
<s> We can still change them later with redesign.  </s>

<s> It would also avoid the grammatically incorrect use of the ampersand.  </s>
<s> Blossom, Could you explain?  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that the ampersand (&amp;) would be an acceptable abbreviation for the word "and" in WAI site navigation, which needs to be short, simple, and not formal.  </s>

<s> Re ampersand usage: 1.  </s>
<s> From The Associated Press Stylebook (2002): Use the ampersand when it is part of a company's formal name: Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.  </s>
<s> The ampersand should not otherwise be used in place of "and." 2. For a more flexible approach, see: The ampersand (&amp;) is an often over-used abbreviation for the word "and."  </s>
<s> Its use should be limited to a few situations.  </s>
<s> Use an ampersand: - in certain company names; e.g. Smith &amp; Jones Consulting; - if space is very limited; e.g. in a table with a lot of text; - when artistic considerations dictate; e.g. a logo; and - in some academic references; e.g. (Grant &amp; Smith, 1998).  </s>
<s> Do not use an ampersand in general writing simply to abbreviate the word and.  </s>
<s> For example, we write: "We need to reorder toner cartridges and paper," not: "We need to reorder toner cartridges &amp; paper."  </s>
<s> The usage suggested below (acceptable abbreviation for the word "and" in WAI site navigation) may fit under the limited space reasoning, but I think it should be a last resort (and not for less formal tone).  </s>
<s> Ideally we should find a better solution.  </s>
