<s> Michelle and Jimmie, Empty ALT attributes allow screen readers and text-only browsers to ignore the images rather than reading out (or showing) the images' filenames.  </s>

<s> Firstly all HTML attributes are one of three types: 1.  </s>
<s> Those which have a default value (e.g. the default colspan value is 1, so there is no need to type td colspan="1" ) 2. Those for which the value can be guessed from context and browser defaults if it is absent, and 3. Those for which there is no reasonable way for the browser to guess the correct value, and which must therefore always be given, such as the src and alt attributes of the img element.  </s>
<s> As such leaving out alt attributes isn't just bad from the point of view of accessibility, it isn't correct HTML.  </s>
<s> As far as accessibility goes I've just said that HTML requires the attribute because there is no good way of guessing it's value.  </s>
<s> When a browser *does* come across such an image it has two choices, it can either assume alt="" which could lead to an important (if badly marked-up) part of the document being ignored, or it can render it as something like [image], the filename, or a similar way of indicating the image's presence.  </s>
<s> The latter is what many non-graphical browsers opt for.  </s>
<s> It has advantages in that it quickly identifies errors, and a page full of [image][image][image] is less confusing for the user than a blank page, as at least they can tell what went wrong.  </s>
