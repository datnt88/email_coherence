<s> I'm posting the actual spreadsheets on my website if you want the gritty details - url forthcoming.  </s>
<s> If you have any questions or suggestions for further analysis please contact me.  </s>

<s> Presenting the Case for Acc.  </s>
<s> And why Web Acc.  </s>
<s> Are maybe the same thing; or Presenting the Case and Alternative Browsing are subsets of Why Web Acc.  </s>
<s> Alternative Browsing is specific, also parallel to How People Use the Web Standards Harmonization should be either on Home Page or Guidelines and Techniques.  </s>
<s> More technical; need to know technologies; then can think about standards.  </s>
<s> Facilitator comments: "Card Sorting was very thorough - he placed almost all the cards deliberated over the ones he wasn't sure about and then checked all his piles re-categorizing a few cards."  </s>
