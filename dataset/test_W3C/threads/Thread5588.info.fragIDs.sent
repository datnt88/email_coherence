<s> Hello, I took an action item to draft templates for meetings.  </s>
<s> I came up with three: 1. Planning meeting template - to help organize information for an event.  </s>
<s> [1] 2. Topic-specific event template - basically an "agenda" for an event.  </s>
<s> [2] 3. Topic-specific proceedings template - a means to gather information after an event.  </s>
<s> [3] These are labelled "topic-specific" because we had talked about two different types of events: 1. "around the world" which would be a general discussion about a variety of current research 2. "topic-specific" which focuses on a specific research topic (e.g., our first event is a topic-specific event focusing on collaboration).  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>

<s> Happy New Year to all RDIG members!  </s>
<s> The planning teleconference that had be scheduled for January 15, has been postponed for a week.  </s>
<s> Details and agenda will be posted in advance of the call.  </s>
<s> You are encouraged to send any comments and ideas to the list that just can't wait until next week!  </s>
<s> regards, Mark Hakkinen Chair - RDIG  </s>
<s> These look good.  </s>
<s> Where do you see we get the discussion items?  </s>
<s> Some probably come from the presenters or the participants during the events so I guess these are more like suggestions?  </s>
<s> Or did you have some other idea?  </s>
