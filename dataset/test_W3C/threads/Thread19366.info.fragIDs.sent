<s> XHTML is case sensitive because XML is case sensitive.  </s>
<s> There are a few restrictions added by making HTML available in XML, but the reason is to make it much easier to process.  </s>
<s> Although there will be some backwards compatibility problems for a little while, most software can already produce lower case, and fixing compatibility to XHTML will also solve a number of other bad practices common in HTML.  </s>
<s> being able to style elements in the source view is pretty helpful - colour is a common appraoch, another is to use bold text for code elements.  </s>
