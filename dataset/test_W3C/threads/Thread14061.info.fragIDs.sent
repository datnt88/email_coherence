<s> A - Introduction "The notion of equivalence which we use allows and requires us to understand that some equivalents are better replacements than others.  </s>
<s> This applies to both textual and non-text equivalents.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we need to make the point more clearly in our definitions."  </s>
<s> Of course the last-minute change to the definition of equivalent partially addresses this issue since it implies that the suitability of an equivalent may depend on the disability and the state of available technology: "In the context of this document, the equivalent must fulfill essentially the same function for the person with a disability (at least insofar as is feasible, given the nature of the disability and the state of technology), as the primary content does for the person without any disability." (Definition of "equivalent", 5 May 1999 WCAG document).  </s>
<s> B - Candidate Equivalent Versus Validated Equivalent Yet it also may be worthwhile to note somewhere (not necessarily in the WCAG document) that for the sake of simplicity, the document does not distinguish between candidate equivalents and validated equivalents.  </s>
<s> I attempted to address this issue in a note in my revision of the 24 March 1999 WCAG draft (http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm).  </s>
<s> Following is an excerpt.  </s>
<s> "Ignored Distinctions" "For simplicity, usage of "equivalent" sometimes ignores distinctions that are worthwhile keeping in mind."  </s>
<s> "Candidate Equivalents versus Validated Equivalents" "There is a distinction between what we might term "candidate equivalents" and "validated equivalents."  </s>
<s> "Basically, the issue, is: "At what point does a candidate equivalent become a validated (true or unqualified) equivalent?"  </s>
<s> For example, when text is placed in the "alt" attribute of the IMG element, it is perhaps formally _more_ correct to say that "The text serves as a _candidate_ text equivalent for the image" than to say "The text serves as the text equivalent for the image."  </s>
<s> The reason for this distinction is that, according to the formal definition of equivalent, one does not have an equivalent unless it is actually capable of being delivered in the requisite way(s) (in the case of text equivalents: synthesized speech, braille, visually-displayed text) and that it actually serves essentially the same communication purpose for the users.  </s>
<s> By this strict standard, one might argue, the text does not serve as a text equivalent until has been validated in some way with users.  </s>
<s> Thus, pursuing this line of reasoning, the Web content developer provides the text that serves as a _candidate text equivalent_ for the image.  </s>
<s> He should achieve a certain level of belief or obtain some amount of evidence that it will actually render properly in the requisite ways (synthesized speech, braille, or visually-displayed text) for the target users before he asserts it to be a validated, true, or unqualified "text equivalent".  </s>
<s> "The use of the phrase "may serve" in the sentence: "An audio clip of a person speaking a text aloud may serve as an auditory equivalent for written text" reflects the conditional nature of the functional adequacy that the audio clip will have when presented to actual users.  </s>
<s> "In common usage, it is expected that this an other distinctions will be often be ignored.  </s>
<s> (They are sometimes ignored in current guidlelines document.)  </s>
<s> For example, the term "text equivalent" is used instead of "candidate text equivalent" even though there may be little or no evidence that to validate it as a true (or unqualified) text equivalent."  </s>
<s> It seems to me that any conformance claim implies a claim that equivalents are either validated or validatable.  </s>
<s> It does not imply that any specific techniques (e.g., Appendix A - Validation) have actually been followed.  </s>
<s> Of course, use of the techniques may make the claim more easily defensible.  </s>

<s> I agree with the conclusion that a claim of conformance includes a claim that equivalents are valid.  </s>
<s> I think that in fact there is only ever a claim for this - there is no test by which it can be absolutely determined that a given "candidate equivalent" in Eric's terminology is in fact valid, just an assertion that it is sufficient.  </s>
<s> Charles McCN [snipped] It seems to me that any conformance claim implies a claim that equivalents are either validated or validatable.  </s>
