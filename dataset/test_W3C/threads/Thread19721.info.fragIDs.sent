<s> The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.1a Beta version of the Amaya editor/browser.  </s>
<s> This release includes the first Alpha public version for PC/Windows.  </s>
<s> You can find enclosed here below a more complete list of the new features of this version.  </s>
<s> This list is also available on-line at: The source code for the Amaya 1.1a Beta release release is available at: This release has also been precompiled for a number of Unix patforms.  </s>
<s> You can download the precompiled binary distribution by following the instructions given at: New features in Amaya 1.1a Extensions: * Anchors and ID attributes: + When Amaya parses a document it verifies that all MAPs have a different NAME value and changes them if not.  </s>
<s> The USEMAP attribute of the related IMG element is also updated.  </s>
<s> + The function "Create Target" generates automatically a NAME or a ID attribute according with the current selection.  </s>
<s> - If the DTD allows the insertion of an anchor as the parent of the current selection, Amaya inserts the anchor and takes the first included word of more than 3 characters as value of the NAME attribute.  </s>
<s> - If only one structured element is selected (DIV, H1, etc.), Amaya generates an ID attribute for this structured element.  </s>
<s> The ID value as the NAME value depends on the included text.  </s>
<s> Amaya checks that the new NAME or ID value is unique.  </s>
<s> If it's not the case it changes the value by adding a counter at the end of the word still it's not unique (example "value1" if "value" already exists).  </s>
<s> + When an anchor with a NAME attribute or an element with an ID attribute is pasted, Amaya checks that the new NAME or ID value is unique and changes its value if not.  </s>
<s> + Functions which create a MAP element generates automatically a NAME with the NAME value "map".  </s>
<s> Amaya checks that the new NAME value is unique.  </s>
<s> + When an IMG with a USEMAP attribute is pasted, Amaya remove this attribute.  </s>
<s> and when an IMG with a USEMAP attribute is deleted, Amaya does take care of the related MAP element.  </s>
<s> The document author has in charge to delete this MAP or relink it to another IMG element.  </s>
<s> * Links: + The functions "Create Link" or "Change Link" create an anchor if the DTD allows the insertion of an anchor as the parent of the current selection.  </s>
<s> Then the user can click on a target anchor or a target document or a structured element with an ID attribute.  </s>
<s> - If it's not a valid target, Amaya displays a form to insert the HREF value.  </s>
<s> - If the user click on a valid target, Amaya generates automatically the HREF value.  </s>
<s> In both cases, Amaya transforms the HREF value to make it relative to the document base (the BASE element value or the current document URL).  </s>
<s> + When an anchor with a HREF attribute is pasted, Amaya transforms the HREF value to make it relative to the document base.  </s>
<s> * Images: + The function "Create Image" creates the SRC value relatively to the document base (the BASE element value or the current document URL).  </s>
<s> Amaya also creates the ALT attribute and initializes its value with the image name.  </s>
<s> + When IMG is pasted, Amaya transforms the SRC value to make it relative to the document base.  </s>
<s> * Publishing: + Button "Copy Images" indicates that images have to be copied into: - the new document directory (on the remote server or locally), - the new image directory, if there is a specified image directory.  </s>
<s> + Button "Transform URLs" indicates that all URLs, SRCs are recomputed when saving the document.  </s>
<s> In both cases, Amaya generates relative URLs when it's possible.  </s>
<s> * Customization: Each user can define his personal file HTML.conf in his HOME directory.  </s>
<s> So each individual user can now customize size and position of Amaya windows.  </s>
<s> * Java: Upgraded to Kaffe-0.9.1 using the JDK 1.1.2 classes.  </s>
<s> The mechanism to access Java objects content has been cleaned up and should be ready for 64 bit targets.  </s>
<s> Java stubs are not distributed anymore, the Makefiles produced by autoconf build them on the fly to avoid conflict in case of changes in the HTML schemas.  </s>
<s> General improvements for the Java classes embedding access to the document C objects.  </s>
<s> * Math: This version of Amaya contains an embryonic MathML editor, that allows mathematical expressions to be embedded in HTML pages.  </s>
<s> It implements a subset of the MathML specification.  </s>
<s> This feature should be considered as a demonstration, as it is very imcomplete.  </s>
<s> More in next releases.  </s>
<s> * MS/Windows This is the first version of amaya that runs on Microsoft Windows (both Windows 95 and Windows/NT).  </s>
<s> Fixed bugs: * Spaces were not accepted in end tags.  </s>
<s> For instance, /STRONG  was considered invalid.  </s>
<s> It is accepted now.  </s>
<s> * Amaya refused to create an Image before an Image.  </s>
<s> Now it works.  </s>
<s> * Sometimes, active zones were not created.  </s>
<s> * Using Style forms, the text was displayed correctly, but the style attribute registered the previous style value instead of the new one.  </s>

<s> Under Windows 95, Amaya 1.1a runs very slowly with frequent pauses for several seconds during which it will not update the screen or respond to the mouse.  </s>
<s> It also does not load pages from the Web (no error message occurs, it just silently fails) although it does load files from the local hard drive.  </s>
<s> Under Linux 2.0.30 (RedHat 4.2), on trying to access a page from the Web, Amaya 1.1a either segfaults or exits with the message "Thot tool kit error: invalid parameter" repeated twice.  </s>
<s> The previous version (1.0b) worked fine.  </s>
