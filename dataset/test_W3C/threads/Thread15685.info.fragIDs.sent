<s> A friend wrote and thought I would share this with everyone...  </s>
<s> Seems to me that if the American Council of the Blind (acb.org) and the American Federation of the Blind (www.nfb.org) don't use the d link then neither should we.  </s>
<s> Granted they only have one gif but if it was important and /or necessary they would probably have used it.  </s>
<s> Any discussion?  </s>
<s> Maybe they're experts in the some fields, but not necessarily experts in designing accessible web pages?  </s>
<s> Maybe they don't _know_ that they can offer additional information to their blind users by using d-links or similar code?  </s>
<s> It's easier to believe that, than to believe they were presented with the option of including d-links and made a conscious decision against using them.  </s>
<s> Why not write and ask, though?  </s>

<s> American Council of the Blind (http://acb.org/)  </s>
<s> use D-links for important information.  </s>
<s> Obviously they don't consider their logo very important compared to the audio file they present.  </s>
<s> They feel that the words American Council for the Blind convey all that anybody is likely to care about.  </s>
<s> I agree with them.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, they really do care about the logo, but don't know how to add a D-Link.  </s>
<s> But it turns out that the ACB have their site produced by a web designer.  </s>
<s> And that web designer has a home page filled with broken images, and no d-links.  </s>
<s> Now who is responsible for letting the customer know how a website can and should be designed?  </s>
<s> Consider the following: I ask one mechanic to look after my car - tell me what needs doing, when, and when I eed to bring the car back so he can check it or do stuff to it.  </s>
<s> If he failed to fix the brakes, because I had not specifically said that I wanted working brakes in my car, what do I do?  </s>
<s> (Hint - think large court payouts) As a web designer, I would say that our own house is way out of order (actually in private I might suggest a figure for the proportion of incompetent sharks amongst us, but only if provoked) and that we should fix it ourselves.  </s>
<s> Which after all is why we are all on this list.  </s>
<s> The nfb give alt text: Image of NFB logo: security - equality - opportunity Same applies.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> further on this, there are some web savvy people who are blind who hit the site often and they've not seen fit to complain.  </s>
<s> or if they have, the complaint went to someone who may not have known what to do with it or if they did, there's a pollicy at work here and I hope so I don't see a problem with the site.  </s>
<s> now, if there was some that said "photo of the whitehouse", I might want a description.  </s>
