<s> Hi all, Does Amaya add any information (inside its request) about the current selected profile (Special\Preferences\Profiles)?  </s>
<s> If not, it will be very interessting to add that, for example using the "user agent" header field (ex: "User-Agent: amaya/7.1 libwww/5.3.1 Mini-browser").  </s>
<s> This will help adaptation-enabled servers to take into account the current profile of the user.  </s>
<s> Best regards Tayeb* Tayeb Lemlouma Opera project National Research Institute in Computer Science and Control (INRIA Rh?ne-Alpes, France )  </s>
<s> Actually I recall that somebody implemented CC/PP for Amaya, but can't find the references at the moment.  </s>
<s> Cheers Charles McCN  </s>

<s> Charles all what I have found is a mail posted by "kinuko yasuda" in Jully 2000 to www-lib@w3.org  </s>
<s> He says that he tries to implement a prototype of an application of libWWW for CC/PP, but no further information is given.  </s>
<s> Did you recall the same implementation?  </s>
