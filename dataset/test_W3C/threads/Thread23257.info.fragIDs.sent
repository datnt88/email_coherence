<s> I'd like to propose an additional normalization feature to remove processing instructions from the document.  </s>
<s> The syntax would be modeled after the comments feature and be roughly as follows: "processing-instructions" true [required] (default) Keep Processing instruction nodes in the document.  </s>
<s> false [required] Discard Processing instruction nodes in the Document.  </s>
<s> This could be useful in many cases where programmer know they aren't going to consider processing instructions.  </s>
<s> For example, SOAP explicitly forbids them.  </s>
<s> Imagine I have an existing document, parsed or built from some source I don't control and I want to copy its root element into a SOAP request or response.  </s>
<s> It would be convenient to throw away processing instructions in one normalizeDocument() call rather than having to walk the tree to get rid of them.  </s>

<s> If SOAP forbids them, then IMO, the proper action when you find them during normal SOAP processing is to raise an error, not remove them.  </s>
<s> Otherwise they may still occur in the exchange with people thinking they are being properly processed.  </s>
<s> It is not clear to me whether this non-infoset-inspired mode should be directly supported by DOM, but I think it could be supported by a custom parser option.  </s>
<s> There are a number of other legal XML constructs forbidden by SOAP that should raise an exception if received.  </s>
<s> I guess there might be a use case if you had an application that was putting them in (not parsing them in) or parsing them in from a non-SOAP source and you wanted it to work in SOAP.  </s>
<s> It is not clear to me whether the application in many cases does not need to examine the PIs as they are removed.  </s>
<s> Unlike CDATASections changing to text, or expansion of entity references, the logical information presented by a document is changed as a result of this operation.  </s>

<s> By the way, if a programmer wants to ignore processing instructions, another way to do this today (when it is not an issue of removing them) is to use the Treewalker API, which is part of the traversal API, and filter appropriately.  </s>
