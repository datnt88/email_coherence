<s> aloha, chaals!  </s>
<s> you are quite right in pointing out that any number would be arbitrarily chosen, but the fact remains that the LEGEND and FIELDSET elements _do_ increase accessibility -- and usability -- by breaking up forms into manageable chucks, and by properly identifying individual controls as belonging to a sub-set of fields... if one of our goals is ensuring interoperability, then FIELDSETs are indispensable... if i were using a mobile device to fill out a form, i personally would want to be able to turn on "verbose forms mode", where the LEGENDs are spoken in conjunction with the individual LABELs defined for individual form controls... this is how most screen-readers enunciate dialog boxes and property sheets (read field label if present before reading control label and announcing the state of the control, for example "checkbox checked" or "radio button not selected"), and how JFW operates in "Forms Mode" when MSIE 4x or 5x is running... FIELDSET, in this light, is analogous to the SUMMARY attribute defined for the TABLE element -- a mobile UA could offer the user a means of listing the number of tables contained in a document, and by using the information contained in the SUMMARY attribute, provide the mobile user with the choice of reviewing the contents of the TABLE or bypassing the TABLE... likewise, a mobile device should not only be capable of alerting the user that there are X number of forms are contained in the page; but could also use the semantic information contained in LEGENDs defined for FIELDSETs to give the user a richer summary of the size, scope, and nature of the form, before the user decides to move-to the form and fill it out... so, i'm holding fast to my stance that, while it is an arbitrary number, 10 is much too high a triggering threshold to do provide any real slash tangible benefit to the end user, whether he or she is using a pervasive device or a mainstream UA in conjunction with assistive technology just my 5 guilders' worth (hey, i've got to get rid of that damn dutch money somehow!) gregory  </s>
