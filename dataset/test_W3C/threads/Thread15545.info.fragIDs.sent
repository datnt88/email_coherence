<s> Hello, Yvette and I have been working on the statement about human testability.  </s>
<s> What we've come up with isn't so much a definition as a statement of what we think the group believes-- or is at least a statement that we would like to be able to make by the time WCAG 2.0 reaches Candidate Recommendation.  </s>
<s> This statement would appear in the Conformance section along with the explanation of how we sorted success criteria into the various levels.  </s>
<s> The Working Group believes that tests can show whether Web content passes or fails each success criterion.  </s>
<s> Tests can be done by computer programs or by people who understand these guidelines.  </s>
<s> We believe that different people who understand the guidelines will usually get the same or very similar results when they test the same success criterion.  </s>

<s> you mean "when they test the same content against the same success criteria"?  </s>
<s> Are you being deliberately vague about what "usually" and "very similar" mean?  </s>
<s> For an explanation of what the working group believes has been achieved this is probably sufficient.  </s>
<s> In practice we will have to arrive at a clearer understanding of the conditions under which "usually" and "very similar" are satisfied.  </s>
<s> That can probably await detailed discussions of success criteria, though, and perhaps doesn't have to be, indeed perhaps cannot be, solved now.  </s>
<s> In general I think the proposed wording is clear and expresses what is intended.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Jason.  </s>
<s> Yes, we mean "...  </s>
<s> When they test the same content against the same success criteria."  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> And yes, I at least (I won't speak for Yvette here) was being deliberately vague about "usually" and "very similar."  </s>
<s> But see Michael's response on this same point, calling for us to define a threshhold and use it to test this very statement (or whatever version of it we agree to).  </s>
