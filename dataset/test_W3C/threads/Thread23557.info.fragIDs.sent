<s> The problem I have in discussing DRM is that most people assume it is all about "locking up" content with encryption and  </s>

<s> It's a fair misconception, given the case  </s>

<s> However, the more enlightened are trying to move away from that and towards an enabling infrastructure, built from a mixture of legal, commercial, and technical tools, that will promote business and improve the consumers lot too.  </s>
<s> If that sounds too idealistic, then perhaps we should give up on digital commerce altogether.  </s>
<s> Personally, I think there is much positive work to do.  </s>

<s> Rigo, I thought that the role of a "consensus based organization" was to _form_ consensus.  </s>
<s> Not say that "there is no consensus" therefore we cannot do anything.  </s>
<s> I think that you will also be surprised about how much consensus there actually is out there on dealing with DRM.  </s>
<s> W3C even had a brief glimpse of such consensus at our DRM Workshop in Jan 2001.  </s>
<s> As David Parrott says, DRM won't go away, so you either do nothing and have no say in the architecture of DRM or you do something and make sure it works.  </s>

<s> JSE: I quite agree with Dave --- this must be about finding ways to work together to build an accessible, enabling, trustable infrastructure upon which to release and enjoy information.  </s>
<s> An infrastructure that embodies these values should NOT be thought of as one-sided; indeed, imagine an environment in which individuals enjoy the very same fine-grained policy enforcement capability that is usually only discussed in the DRM context.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, when people hear "trusted platform," they tend to only think of a particular, narrow application scenario, rather than considering the richness that a trustable infrastructure, characterized by the pervasive ability to create, transform and experience "data with rules," could provide.  </s>
<s> Indeed, these issues will *not* go away; they will only multiply.  </s>
<s> One step is to work purposefully towards standards int he hard areas; specifically, in DRM we need to actively search for the agreeable points of interaction between systems and solutions.  </s>
<s> These points of interaction ppint to where the standards will be found.  </s>
