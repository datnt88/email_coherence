<s> Greetings, The attached tiny xhtml 1.1 file (validated) shows what I believe to be three bugs - 1.  </s>
<s> The alignment of the float is wrong - the heading ('Culture') is well below the place where the object text ('Man') should be - instead of on its left - and the 'same' line!  </s>
<s> Note that if the alternative text is actually being 'displayed' it is well above the top of the window - an image actually shows the bottom dozen rows of pixels right at the top of the window.  </s>
<s> 2. The structure view reveals two spans inside an object instead of the single object element inside a span element.  </s>
<s> 3. The object element structure refers to an img element - which is just not there!  </s>

<s> Amaya doesn't support float, which explains the first problem.  </s>
<s> Lots of people would like it, but nobody has time to code it.  </s>
<s> Do you have a student who is intersted in a project?  </s>
<s> The other two are bugs I guess - the img bit is in fact longstanding - since version 1.3 I think.  </s>

<s> Hi, You're right this is a bug  </s>
<s> Unfortunately Amaya doesn't support float yet.  </s>
<s> You're right 2 and 3 are bugs.  </s>
<s> We'll have a look at them.  </s>
