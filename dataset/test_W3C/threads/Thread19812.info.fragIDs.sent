<s> Hallo, whenever I try to use http put to save a document (into a htaccess protected area) amaya exists with a broken pipe message.  </s>
<s> The authentication scheme used is "basic" amaya is version 1.2a.  </s>

<s> Hmmm... Works well at W3C using Jigsaw and Jigedit, which uses access control.  </s>
<s> What server (and version) are you using?  </s>
<s> Is it configured to support PUT? (Apache must be configured to use PUT; it doesn't work out of the box).  </s>
<s> Old servers (HTTP/1.0) will also fail in random ways, due to problems with the protocol, fixed in HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> You might also use Henrik Frystyk's command line tool and/or his GUI put tool to test if your server is working correctly.  </s>
<s> See: http://www.w3.org/Library/ - Jim Gettys  </s>
<s> I use Apache, which is configured to use http/put.  </s>
<s> Works well with netscape and works also if no authentication is required.  </s>
<s> BTW: there is another wierdness about the authentication: It comes up with the authentication dialog multiple times (appearently for every pic in the page, not sure about that number).  </s>
<s> It's an apache 1.1.3.  </s>
<s> Too old?  </s>
<s> Thanks for the pointer.  </s>
<s> I was looking for a command line http put tool for a long time.  </s>

<s> Known problem in in the version of libwww that Amaya 1.2a uses.  </s>
<s> You could rebuild against a more recent libwww.  </s>
<s> Yes; that is an HTTP/1.0 server.  </s>
<s> There is no guarantee that a PUT on an HTTP/1.0 server will ever work; it depends on exact details of the network connection and the client and server implementation.  </s>
<s> The protocol itself is broken, and so some servers and clients try to code around the problem.  </s>
<s> Netscape before Version 4 is completely broken with PUT.... (I presume you are using Netscape 4).  </s>
<s> There is no way to reliably do PUT with HTTP/1.0, though you can make it work "most" of the time, which is what Navigator 4 is doing...  </s>
<s> The protocol is fixed in HTTP/1.1 (Apache 1.2 or later; 1.3 just came out: I recommend you install this.  </s>
<s> Yes, send kudo's to Henrik... - Jim  </s>
