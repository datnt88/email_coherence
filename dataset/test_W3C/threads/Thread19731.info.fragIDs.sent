<s> Hi I noticed that in the directory thot\win95\bin there are a couple of files that you don't need to send out Amaya.exp Amaya.ilk Amaya.lib Amaya.pdb  </s>
<s> They're all MSVC build files.  </s>
<s> I'm sure removing them will make the 2.8 Meg of the distribution file a fair bit smaller ;-)  </s>
