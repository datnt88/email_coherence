<s> In my experience creating web sites for companies and organizations, I have found that most people are ignorant (by no fault of thier own) to the needs of many useres of the web.  </s>
<s> People picture it as a visual medium.  </s>
<s> I do believe however that the future will be brighter because of several factors.  </s>
<s> One is that creating accessible content is something that can be sold as a product, and that web design firms (like my employer) will begin to push.  </s>
<s> This isn't a purely selfless act, as it will add another product to the package, and more money to the price tag.  </s>
<s> It can also be an easy sell to clients, because who doesn't have a friend or loved one with some sort of disability.  </s>
<s> The other factor is that most large scale sites are template driven, especially those made by my company.  </s>
<s> The beauty there is that you can make several versions of the site by changing just one template page.  </s>
<s> So with one set of content, you can have versions of the site for slow modems, screen readers, large print, or printer-friendly pages.  </s>

<s> The idea that "retrofitting's a bitch" and its corollary "programmers are cheaper than lawyers" are beginning to take hold and I hope your firm has the good sense to in fact charge extra if accessibility concerns are not addressed as a defense against future complicity negligence lawsuits.  </s>

<s> We don't need a bunch of "separate but equal" Webs or Web pages.  </s>
<s> I hope we can reach agreement on the basic principles to achieve device independence - starting with the idea that a human user is a "device" in the sense we are speaking of.  </s>
