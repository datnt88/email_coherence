<s> Forgive me for entering this discussion so late, but I have been away from this list since mid-April.  </s>
<s> I read through the archive and was surprised by some of the discussions.  </s>
<s> For what it's worth, here're my two cents:  </s>
<s> As for Priority 3.3, I read it to say that you should use a stylesheet for  </s>
<s> layout vs. elements such as B, I, FONT, etc.  </s>
<s> As far as I'm concerned, as  </s>
<s> long as you avoid those elements, you've met this priority.  </s>
<s> If you want to  </s>
<s> make text red, use a stylesheet or the style attribute rather than the font  </s>
<s> tag.  </s>
<s> If you can live without the B, I, etc. tags, and you don't feel that  </s>
<s> you need a stylesheet, I don't see that Priority 3.3 requires one.  </s>
<s> What, a  </s>
<s> blank one, just for looks?  </s>
<s> Frankly, I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it could be better phrased, but why on earth would anyone want to require a stylesheet if a document doesn't need one?  </s>
<s> As for Priority 5.3, it is clear to me that tables may be used for layout in the interim (until stylesheets are better implemented) provided they still make sense when linearized.  </s>
<s> I read several times that you can't have a triple-A site if you use tables for formatting the page.  </s>
<s> I don't see it.  </s>
<s> Where does it say that in the Guidelines?  </s>
<s> Also, several comments seemed to imply that this was an either/or proposition (either tables or a stylesheet).  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> Stylesheets are very useful for controlling font size, color, style, weight, text-decoration, line length, etc. Tables are currently a necessary evil on most sites because stylesheet positioning is not well implemented yet.  </s>
<s> I use stylesheets for everything but positioning (and even for some types of positioning, like indentation) and a big, simple table for layout.  </s>
<s> It linearizes just fine.  </s>
<s> It's not ideal, but as far as I'm concerned, it meets the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> And it degrades gracefully when the stylesheet is not utilized.  </s>
<s> Finally, Priority 11.1 clearly covers the above situations.  </s>
<s> It says to use W3C technologies when they are "available and appropriate for a task."  </s>
<s> So if I'm designing an intranet site for Netscape 3 only, I'm certainly not going to waste my time with a stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Similarly, if I'm designing for the web, but stylesheet positioning is not implemented well enough to use, then it is neither "available" nor "appropriate for the task" yet.  </s>
<s> When it becomes so, I will upgrade my sites accordingly.  </s>
<s> I find it interesting that so much commentary has been devoted to the above (non?) issues while several (to me) more perplexing problems have gone unmentioned.  </s>
<s> I will bring those up in separate messages to permit individual threads.  </s>
<s> Charles Munat Munat, Inc. Seattle, Washington (formerly of Code Red Internet Solutions, Puerto Vallarta)  </s>
<s> As someone who claims that the use of tables to control layout is incompatible with stylesheets, I agree with Charles that it does not conflict in presentational control.  </s>
<s> But the use of tables for layout control is incompatible with the use of stylesheets for layout control, as recommended in the CSS specification.  </s>
<s> I also agree that it is possible to use the 11.1 checkpoint to argue that use of stylesheets for layout control is not currently an option.  </s>
<s> Pesonally I would therefore use less layout control.  </s>
