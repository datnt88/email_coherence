<s> Hi Tidy People-- Tidy doesn't like script tags inside a tr .  </s>
<s> It chooses to move it to before the table tag.  </s>
<s> The problem is that my script tag references an  </s>
<s> image defined above it using the javascript DOM, so that when it's moved to  </s>
<s> before the table, it gets an undefined object error when it executes.  </s>
<s> I can't find anything in the HTML spec that specifically prohibits the script tag from living within the tr (or any other tag).  </s>
<s> I believe my  </s>
<s> HTML is correct, and Tidy is providing an unnecessary clean up.  </s>
<s> Is this something you can (or would be willing to) fix, or is there some specification that says script tags can only be defined within the body tag?  </s>
<s> I am actually experiencing this problem with the Java version of Tidy, but  </s>
<s> Andy Q. does not want to deviate from your functionality.  </s>
<s> My HTML looks like this: document.processing.src  </s>
<s> = 'IMAGE2.gif';  </s>
<s> Tidy makes it look like this: document.processing.src  </s>
<s> = 'IMAGE2.gif';  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, --Susan susan_levine@peoplesoft.com  </s>
<s> This is indeed illegal.  </s>
<s> The simplest fix is to move the script into the table cell.  </s>
<s> You could also rewrite your script to avoid the processing error.  </s>
<s> Tidy isn't smart as a human and doesn't have enough common sense to "know" that this is a good thing to do.  </s>
<s> For instance, it doesn't understand hardly anything about JavaScript.  </s>
