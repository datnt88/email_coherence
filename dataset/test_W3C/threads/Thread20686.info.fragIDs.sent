<s> You are right, it is a bug.  </s>
<s> I have fixed it in the CVS version.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your report.  </s>

<s> I always find it incredible that such things are even discovered!  </s>
<s> I'm sure there's some very good reason for hitting "shift enter" at that point, but it somehow seemed like a strange thing to have learned.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> [DJW:] Whilst Amaya shouldn't crash in the way that you describe, this HTML is badly broken.  </s>
<s> DIR is deprecated, but even when used, its content model: [DJW:] does not allow text immediately after the start tag - only LI elements are allowed - and doesn't allow P anywhere within the content - all block level elements are forbidden.  </s>
<s> I'll assume the lack of the mandatory TITLE element was the result of simplifying for this article.  </s>
<s> Note the start tag on LI elements in required.  </s>

<s> [DJW:] PS I think the effect you are trying to achieve can only correctly be achieved using a CSS attribute of "list-style:none" on the list items (works for IE 5.01, NS 4.75 and Mozilla 0.9.2; fails for Amaya 4.2.1; Amaya 5 doesn't even display the home page, but I haven't time to diagnose now).  </s>
