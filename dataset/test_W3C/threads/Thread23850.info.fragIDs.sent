<s> Hello all, You may be interested in a program called ThumbsPlus.  </s>
<s> It displays thumbnails of virtually all graphical formats and can also quickly generate a table with all the charaters of a font.  </s>
<s> It can even be blown up to full screen so you can see all of the characters in a reasonable size.  </s>
<s> I do not have a web site address for the software, but the "about" section lists two e-mail addresses: cerious@vnet.net and 76352.142@compuserve.com  </s>
<s> I can't recall the price, but it was very reasonable considering the power and flexibility this little gem has.  </s>
<s> I would recommend you look into it.  </s>
<s> Please note that I have no relation to the manufacturer except as a satisfied customer.  </s>

<s> It can be downloaded from If you have Word you can run a macro (documented somewhere under available fonts') which will create a document containing samples of all your installed fonts.  </s>
