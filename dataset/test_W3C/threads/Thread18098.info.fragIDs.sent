<s> Aha, okay.  </s>
<s> So you are arguing that web designers have to account for people who need assistive technology, could benefit from assistive technology, may even have access to assistive technology (such as the screen magnifier in Windows), but who choose not to employ it?  </s>
<s> That's a very dangerous argument to propose, you realize...  </s>
<s> I argue that there are ways for those users who need larger text to get the larger text without requiring that web designers _remove_ their graphical text images.  </s>
<s> The implications of placing the burden on the web designer instead of on the user are that unreasonable expectations are asked of the designer, and she is unable to reasonably comply with those requirements.  </s>
<s> Thus, she ignores them.  </s>

<s> How much larger?  </s>
<s> Should there be a minimum font size equivalent (pixels, points, etc.) on graphical image text?  </s>
<s> --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> the point is that small as len says is not necessarily fully correctable with assistive technology and to force someone to use something to correct something that should not need correcting is a violation of good customer practice.  </s>

<s> It's not merely a question of people choosing to not emply assistive technology out of whim or stubborness.  </s>
<s> Assistive technology may not produce as good a solution as accessibility built into the web page, as I noted when I talked about problems with magnifiers.  </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong: magnfiers can be invaluable tools, and some people will need them no matter what is done with the web page.  </s>
<s> And people need them when the web page hasn't built in the accessibility.  </s>

<s> In WCAG terms this translates to whether we need a checkpoint to deal with a problem, and what priority should be given to the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> For the first, I think Len has identified a number of reasons why text is better than images.  </s>
<s> To complicate that a little, there is now a markup language called SVG, in which text (real text) can be presented using amazing font effects.  </s>
<s> These things will most likely, in the immediate future, be served as images, included in html documents with an img or object element.  </s>
<s> How do they fit into the requirement.  </s>
<s> There is an alternative - to use namespaces to combine several XML types.  </s>
<s> This approach is being taken by Amaya to include MathML, XHTML, and SVG (in the development version - release expected soon) in the one document, so it will be using an appropriate markup language to present the content, will have proper equivalent content, etc...  </s>
<s> As to priority: I guess it turns on what the difficulty presented is.  </s>
<s> There is an ongoing (and necessary in my opinion) discussion on how to define what we require of users, that is important input to this decision.  </s>

<s> It's "better" by some standards -- it's "better" for accessibility, certainly.  </s>
<s> No one is actually disputing that.  </s>
<s> (Indeed, Edapta's web morphing service explicitly replaces images with styled textual equivalents when edapting pages for many audiences, as well as providing the capacity to create variant-size button sets.)  </s>
<s> However, it is important to recognize that HTML + CSS is _not_ a workable general replacement for images as text.  </s>
<s> Most graphical  </s>
<s> web designers will _not_ accept styled text as a solution because of the following: (1) CSS is not widely implemented yet and excludes older browsers.  </s>
<s> (2) CSS support on Netscape (and to a lesser extent, IE) is seriously buggy and cannot be relied upon.  </s>
<s> (3) Graphical designers may have valid reasons for desiring a specific font that is not widely available (and thus styles are not acceptable).  </s>
<s> (4) There are a number of effects available in images which cannot be replicated by using styled text.  </s>
<s> As examples, consider drop shadows on text, or mouseover "glow auras".  </s>
<s> My personal philosophy regarding web accessibility is that "we" (the people who understand accessibility principles and in some cases write the guidelines) should _not_ be telling a web designer that she should "stop using that."  </s>
<s> Instead, we should tell her how to "make it accessible", whatever she's using.  </s>
<s> (Be it Flash, animated GIFs, Streaming Audio, etc.) It is "our" responsibility (as informed advocates for web accessibility) to provide the right answers, and we have a responsibility to not leave the web designer hanging -- it is not acceptable to say "don't use that thing which meets your needs, instead use this method which will not."  </s>
<s> I suggest therefore that instead of looking for ways to _forbid_ textual images, we should rather concentrate our energies on ways to make textual images more accessible.  </s>
<s> That may require user agent guidelines, it may require web content guidelines, but simply throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not sufficient.  </s>
<s> Let's be realistic here, folks -- we _cannot_ force most web designers to give up their textual images.  </s>
<s> If that is a requirement for double-A accessibility, then _web designers will not design double A sites_, period.  </s>
<s> If given a choice between the benefits of graphical text (and you are living in denial if you claim there there are not benefits from a design standpoint!) and accessibility, accessibility _will lose_.  </s>
<s> Bottom line: We should _not_ be forcing web designers to have to make that choice!  </s>
<s> _We_ should be out finding the way to "do it right" rather than trying to say "don't do it at all."  </s>

<s> This font treatment predates the Web, and is used in a variety of paper-based branding materials.  </s>
<s> Millions of dollars have been spent building this brand.  </s>
<s> The font in question is not installed on many systems, and is not likely to be for a variety of non-technical reasons.  </s>
<s> Part of the branding requirement is that the font appear in an anti-aliased form.  </s>
<s> As a result of all of this, there are headings created in gifs (with alt text) on some of this company's Web sites.  </s>
<s> The Web developers and designers would actually prefer not to do this, since it's a lot of extra work and makes automated creation of content difficult.  </s>

<s> So should that control be available to the user?  </s>
<s> The idea is that scalable visual objects could be added alongside text as a class of stuff that the user should be able to control the size of.  </s>
<s> Then we can haggle over the "minimum implementation" description.  </s>
<s> But the basic idea is that controlling the scaling of a scalable visual (where SVG is the clear W3C branded example) on an object basis independently from its containing viewport is feasible and valuable.  </s>
<s> Options of interest include: Rescale selected object.  </s>
<s> Make it a scroll region.  </s>
<s> Reflow around it at new size.  </s>
<s> Scale all scalable visuals containing text to meet minimum text size criterion.  </s>
