<s> Thanks Michael, yes there are ways to use stylesheets to avoid this problem.  </s>

<s> Additional guidelines are needed.  </s>
<s> The EM is not enough.  </s>
<s> BTW, another way to write the guideline is to require that layout features of style sheets be used only in ways that duplicate the semantics of tables used for layout... a situation in which this overlap problem can't arise.  </s>

<s> That's a good illustration of the point I was trying to make: that it isn't enough to use relative units, like EM.  </s>
<s> More is needed.  </s>
<s> One way to write the guidelines is to restrict use of CSS layout to those features that duplicate table layout... although this may well be too restrictive a use of CSS.  </s>

<s> Hi Len, Yes! Good point.  </s>
<s> I see that on many pages.  </s>
<s> On some pages with tables the text is under the image if a the user sets a large font.  </s>
<s> Most of font size and table witdh conflicts are the cause of problems low vision have with reading pages on the Internet.  </s>
<s> Maybe browser developers could introduce options like "Loading table column in new window" or "loading table cell in new window" or "Disable JavaScript if a page in a frame is loading in a new window"?  </s>
