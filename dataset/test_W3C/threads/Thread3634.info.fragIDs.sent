<s> I just posted Tex's FAQ, but despite Tex having prepared it in HTML it was rather painful to convert it to XHTML for publication.  </s>
<s> Could I ask  </s>
<s> that in future if you submit an FAQ in HTML you prepare it in XHTML from the start and ensure that it validates.  </s>
<s> (And I know I need to develop a style guide.) Cheers, RI Richard Ishida W3C contact info: http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/ See the W3C Internationalization FAQ page  </s>
<s> Sorry for any work I caused you.  </s>
<s> I had started from a template from one of the other published questions, which also didn't validate.  </s>
<s> You had indicated you didn't want the style changed significantly so I thought I was kind of stuck using it.  </s>
<s> (That was before I switched to the multi-question format.)  </s>
<s> However, I just valdiated the page I submitted and I am surprised at the duplicate ids in there.  </s>
<s> Usually I catch and fix that kind of stuff.  </s>
<s> Anyway, if we have a validating template to fill in, it shouldn't be a problem to keep it clean.  </s>
<s> Sorry about the extra work.  </s>
<s> Thanks for posting it.  </s>
<s> Have a good weekend!  </s>
