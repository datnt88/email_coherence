<s> Hi, in RFC3253, A.18 Checked-Out Version-Controlled Configuration the supported methods are defined as: - all version-controlled configuration methods.  </s>
<s> In this case it looks like, for example, CHECKIN method is not supported by a checked-out versin-controlled configuration.  </s>
<s> I think that what is missing here is: - all checked-out version controlled resource methods.  </s>
<s> Regards Sasha  </s>
<s> I agree, this is a bug.  </s>
<s> I'll start an errata page and post it on the delta-v website.  </s>
<s> Thanks Tim  </s>
<s> May I encourage everyone who has read the spec to contribute to the Delta-V FAQ.  </s>
<s> The aim is to capture the answers that you found counter-intuitive, required further explanation, or were simply not covered in the specification.  </s>
<s> The FAQ is at http://www.webdav.org/deltav/faq -- and anyone can contribute.  </s>
<s> Regards, Tim  </s>
