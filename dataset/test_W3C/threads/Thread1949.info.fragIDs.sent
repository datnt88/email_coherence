<s> interesting question.  </s>
<s> I had to look around a bit to find them.  </s>
<s> they are currently being maintained on what used to be the www.apps.ietf.org  </s>
<s> web server (back when I was an apps AD).  </s>
<s> most of the content of the web server has since been moved elsewhere, but we never made arrangements for the list to be archived at a different location.  </s>
<s> the list is still being maintained on cs.utk.edu, and the list maintains archives by appending to a local (NFS mounted) file based on the name of the list and the date.  </s>
<s> obviously we need to fix this.  </s>
<s> but for the next few days at least, you can find the archives (since Feb 1999 - is this when it started?) at http://wilma.cs.utk.edu/mail-archive/ the filenames are of the form {listname}.{year)-{month} be aware that these archives include spam and probably viruses, most of which were filtered out before the mail was sent to the list.  </s>
