<s> Hi Everyone, I have a questionnaire within which the questions can have 1 of 4 types of answers.  </s>
<s> Answers can be either textbox, dropdown list, radio buttons, or checkboxes.  </s>
<s> The problem lies within the multi-answer types (radio buttons and checkboxes), because I can't associate the question text with them.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, if I associate their respective answer text, then the singleton answer types (textbox and dropdown list) have no labels.  </s>
<s> From what I could find with my own research, the only solution to the problem is to use FIELDSET and LEGEND.  </s>
<s> The problem with this solution is that FIELDSET puts boxes around everything within the FIELDSET, and there is no way to turn off the border.  </s>
<s> So, for now, what I did was to  </s>
<s> conditionally associate the question text with the answer - when the answer is either a textbox or dropdown list.  </s>
<s> In cases where the answer is a set of radio buttons or checkboxes, I associate the answer text with its respective radio button or checkbox.  </s>
<s> If you can provide me with any other solutions, or input of any kind on this issue, it would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Scott  </s>
<s> I'm not 100% I followed exactly what your problem is, so please forgive me if I'm giving obvious answers...not trying to sound patronising, simply trying to cover all bases first...  </s>
<s> Boxes as in visual boxes ?  </s>
<s> Use CSS fieldset { border: none;  </s>
<s> Look at the source of the below test page...maybe that will shed a bit more light into the issue... Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford  </s>
<s> Re-reading your original question, it may be useful to add the following to my (fieldset-centric) reply: Fieldset should be used when you have multiple inputs relating to the same question (ideal example would be radio buttons or checkboxes).  </s>
<s> In the case of a single textbox or dropdown list, you wouldn't need to use a fieldset (unless it's to logically group multiple questions within a single topic area), so a normal label associtated with the textbox of select should suffice.  </s>
