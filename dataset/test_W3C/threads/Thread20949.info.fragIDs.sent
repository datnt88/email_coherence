<s> Hi I don't know if it is just a problem or a bug.  </s>
<s> Running amaya 8.5 (xp variant) on M$Windows2000.  </s>
<s> A document (forced to type  </s>
<s> html4 transitional) that ends in a table as the last element.  </s>
<s> How to create a new paragraph (or any other element) after the table?  </s>
<s> In the past, I expect repeated ctrl-return should finally get me there.  </s>
<s> However, it now just creates new paragraphs in the last cell.  </s>
<s> CBee  </s>
<s> Hello,  </s>
<s> To add something after a table, select the whole table (using F2 key on Windows) then press the Enter key.  </s>
<s> A new paragraph is created after the table.  </s>
<s> You can find more details in the Help Tables 'Working with Tables' section.  </s>
<s> Thanks Laurent Carcone  </s>
<s> This is a bit counter intuitive - I would expect this to replace the table  </s>
<s> with an empty paragraph, whereas I expect to be able to do it by going to the  </s>
<s> end of the table and repeating return enough.  </s>

<s> I don't think a user expects to lost the table when this table is selected and he hits the Enter key.  </s>

<s> We did that in previous versions of Amaya but it didn't allow one to keep an empty cell.  </s>
<s> The standard behavior of the Enter key is to generate a new element of the current selected element type.  </s>
<s> By example, if you select a H2 the Enter key generates a new H2 after.  </s>
<s> When a cell is selected the Enter key generates a new cell.  </s>
<s> There are two exceptions: it generates a paragraph when a pre or a table is selected.  </s>
<s> The shortcut Shift + Enter (XHTML Paragraph) will replace a selected H2 by a paragraph.  </s>

<s> This is standard behaviour in almost every application I use.  </s>
<s> I was surprised when it didn't happen, and I think other users would be too unless they don't ever use word processors.  </s>
<s> Hmm. Thinking about this a bit mre seems a good idea.  </s>
<s> I can see that this is not an intuitive user interface convention, but without having a better idea to propose I don't suppose that helps much :-) Cheers Chaals  </s>
