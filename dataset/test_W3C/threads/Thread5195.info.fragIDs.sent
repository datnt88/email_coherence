<s> Hi, im doing some experiments with DAML-S/OWL-S and i have some doubts:  </s>
<s> 1) Is there any java package with high level APIs for managing this services' ontologies or should i write it from scratch (using Jena or else) ?  </s>
<s> 2) I've read that DAML-S (OWL-S) and WSDL should have a bidirectional relationship (for grounding): -in DAML-S (OWL-S) Wsdlgrounding (wsdlOperation, wsdlMessagepart etc.) -in WSDL using daml-s-parameter (owl-s-parameter) Can you please explain me this choice ?  </s>
<s> Wont it be sufficient to have DAML-S pointing to WSDL docs ?  </s>
<s> In daml-s-wsdl.htm  </s>
<s> i found this sentence: 3) Is there any WSDL2OWLS site/service/package like WSDL2DAMLS ?  </s>

<s> There are several tools and APIs for managing (OWL) ontologies in general.  </s>

<s> There is an IBM ontology management system called SNOBASE.  </s>
<s> Details at: managing ontologies written in OWL.  </s>
<s> Also, in this SNOBASE package, there is a basic version of API for accessing DAML-S ontology model for Web Services.  </s>

<s> Thank you for pointing this out, I was just about the send this message about our API.  </s>
<s> We have a beta version of OWL-S API available at The API provides reading different versions of OWL-S (0.9, 1.0 as well as DAML-S 0.7) and generating the OWL-S output so you can use it as a version converter.  </s>
<s> Executing OWL-S services that has a WSDL grounding is provided in the API.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately documentation is not complete and not many examples exist in the package.  </s>
<s> However, javadocs (http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/api/docs/javadocs/)  </s>
<s> should help you get started and I'd be happy to answer questions.  </s>
