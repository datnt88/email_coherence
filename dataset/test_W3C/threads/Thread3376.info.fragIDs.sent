<s> Other than that everything seems to be there - Czech Republic is seperated from Slovakia, the various countries that used to make up Yugoslavia are more or less there (I don't know the current status of the Yugoslav federation which last I heard included Serbia and Montenegro), Monaco is squashed by the button for Nice, but that's OK, etc...  </s>
