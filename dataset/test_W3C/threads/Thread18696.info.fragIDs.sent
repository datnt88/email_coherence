<s> Hello, Eric Hansen and I just spent some time discussing content focus requirements in the 8 July 2002 UAAG 1.0 [1].  </s>
<s> I would like to propose the following clarifications, for the next draft.  </s>
<s> Please indicate whether you have any objections.  </s>
<s> Thank you, _ Ian  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20020708/ 1) Checkpoint 9.1 starts: "1.  </s>
<s> Provide at least one content focus for each viewport (including frames) where enabled elements are part of the rendered content."  </s>
<s> When a viewport includes no enabled elements (whether a particular piece of content doesn't include enabled elements or the format never allows interactivity), content focus requirements of the following checkpoints don't apply: 1.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 6.6, 7.1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 10.2, 10.6, 11.5.  </s>
<s> For instance, the content focus highlight requirements of checkpoint 10.2 don't apply when there is no content focus.  </s>
<s> I would like to add a normative exclusion to 9.1 that states this.  </s>
<s> Eric and I discussed whether a "ContentFocus" label would be useful, and we concluded it would not, as it would not provide useful information to someone reading a claim.  </s>
<s> It would only be used to tell someone that a user agent doesn't support interactivity at all for a format, which says more about the format than about the user agent.  </s>
<s> 2) Checkpoint 5.1 reads: "1.  </s>
<s> Allow configuration so that if a viewport opens without explicit user request, its content focus does not automatically become the current focus."  </s>
<s> Since a viewport may open that does not have a content focus, this checkpoint should read: "1.  </s>
<s> Allow configuration so that if a viewport opens without explicit user request, its content focus or user interface does not automatically become the current focus." 3) In checkpoint 11.5, provision 1, the term "focus" should be replaced by "content focus" for clarity.  </s>
<s> The other parts of the sentence make it clear that content focus is intended.  </s>
<s> 4) We recently removed the VisualText conformance label since we felt that any user agent that renders text visually has to satisfy checkpoints 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.  </s>
<s> For user agents that don't, they can invoke applicability.  </s>
<s> Eric and I propose to re-instate the VisualText label (for the above checkpoints) and treat it like the Selection label: * If the UA renders text content visually, the user agent must satisfy those checkpoints.  </s>
<s> This is a little more "transparent" than relying on UA developers to invoke applicability.  </s>
<s> * For audio/speech-only user agents, a developer can opt out of those checkpoints by reference to the label.  </s>
<s> This change does not affect conformance, but I agree with Eric that having an explicit label (required as soon as the UA renders visual text) is probably better than relying on the applicability clause.  </s>
<s> Also: - I will add a link from the definition of "content focus" to checkpoint 9.1.  </s>
<s> - Eric and I reviewed chapter 3 (Conformance) and have some ideas for simplifying it.  </s>
<s> These changes will appear in the next draft.  </s>

<s> Tom Gilder raised in wai-ig the fact that the above also needs to cover elements with CSS overflow property set to produce scrollbars - the element with the scrollbars needs to be able to recieve focus - Mozilla currently does not make these elements accessible, and IE requires the use of the proprietary tabindex extension as an author.  </s>
<s> I propose changing "including frames" to "including frames, and any element which can be scrolled" (or similar)  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> I suspect that what you are asking for is already covered: * You must be able to move the content focus to any  </s>
<s> enabled element.  </s>
<s> Whether you consider the scrolled element as part of the same or different viewport, checkpoint 9.1 as written covers what you're asking for.  </s>
<s> * If you are talking about operating the scrollbars themselves through the keyboard, that's covered by checkpoint 1.1.  </s>
<s> Does this sound correct?  </s>

<s> Yep, that seems to be, sorry for not checking in detail, it was just because it was fresh in my mind and seemed relevant to the checkpoint being discussed.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jim.  </s>
