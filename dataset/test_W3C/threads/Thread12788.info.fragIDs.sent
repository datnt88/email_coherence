<s> Hello from Germany!  </s>
<s> I'm doing the HWG Course 'Universal Accessibility' at the moment (Week Three Reading Assignment) so I have to deal with the WCAG.  </s>
<s> I downloaded the 'curric.zip'  </s>
<s> file twice - but neither copy of the file could be opened by Winzip 7 SR1: it says 'missing 10 bytes in file' !  </s>
<s> As the online costs in Germany are relativly expensive I would prefer to have the slide sets locally to read them over.  </s>
<s> Please try to fix the problem - or could you give me any advice how to access the downloaded 'curric.zip' with another tool to get at least the rest of the content?  </s>
<s> Thank you very much in advance!  </s>

<s> Hello Gerhard, Thank you for pointing out the problem.  </s>
<s> The previous version of curric.zip was indeed corrupted.  </s>
<s> I uploaded a new version of the archive, then downloaded and tested it, and it works.  </s>
<s> I apologize for any inconvenience the error may have caused you.  </s>
