<s> Subject: Netscape Bug or KeepAlive Feature ?  </s>
<s> I have been looking into the action of posting forms.  </s>
<s> POST / HTTP/1.0 Referer: http://************ Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Mozilla/2.0b6a (X11; I; OSF1 V3.2 alpha) Host: zorch.w3.org:5000 Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */* Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-length: 36 action=Submit&amp;text=This+is+some+data Now by my reconing the final CRLF is bogus.  </s>
<s> I would expect the next transaction to start.  </s>
<s> The HTTP/1.1 spec does not require a trailing CRLF and the entity is precisely 36 bytes:- action=Submit&amp;text=This+is+some+data 123456789012345678901234567890123456 This is worrying me, is there a plan to permit footers on keepalive transactions and the CRLF is simply an artifact of that.  </s>
<s> Or is there a "feature" here that people have been writing code ?  </s>
<s> I got the same result from Mosaic: POST / HTTP/1.0 Accept: */*, q=0.300 Accept: text/plain Accept: text/html User-Agent: Spyglass_Mosaic/2.10 OSF1V2.0 Spyglass/9 Accept-Language: en Connection: Keep-Alive Referer: http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/WIT/Specification/entry.html  </s>
<s> Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-length: 36 Extension: Security/Digest Extension: Payment/FirstVirtual text=This+is+some+data&amp;action=Submit  </s>
<s> Is this simply me misreading the 1.1 spec or have we got an issue here?  </s>
<s> It would be "upsetting" to discover that forms handling programs were dependent on a bogus trailing CRLF to teminate a www-form-urlencoded data item.  </s>
<s> Phill [Isn't it nice to be able to get some coding done with everyone at the IETF :-) ] ------- End of Forwarded Message  </s>
<s> Yes, existing form handlers were dependent on that trailing CRLF, and that's why it was added to Netscape.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if it would break anything if the content-length was just incremented by two.  </s>

<s> My vote would be to do this.  </s>
<s> We will have to resolve the problem one way or another to make keepalive work.  </s>
<s> After all the form encoding is a bit of a hack in any case.  </s>

<s> The extra CRLF is sent to fix bugs in cgi programs.  </s>
<s> The problem stems from the use of PERL to parse cgi input.  </s>
<s> If you use a getline function it will only return data at every CRLF boundary.  </s>
<s> If browsers don't send a final CRLF at the end of the post data, many cgi programs will never get the data since the post data does not normally contain a CRLF at the end.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we can do something to fix this for the 1.1 draft so that we can stop sending the extra CRLF.  </s>

<s> I think it would break binary files in weird ways.  </s>
<s> For instance transfering an executable would cause it to gain 2 bytes on every transfer.  </s>
<s> It would certainly break anything that contained a checksum.  </s>

<s> As I said to Ari, I don't really care about CRLF or not CRLF.  </s>
<s> We can add any number of bytes at the ent of the URI and it does not much bother me.  </s>
<s> What bothers me is that the content-length given is wrong.  </s>
<s> If we rewrite the www-uri-encoded-form spec to allow (sounds as if we need to require) trailing CRLF and give the size of the message as the complete chunk up to and including the CRLF.  </s>
<s> I know this sounds picky but that is what stards are about:-) Phill  </s>
<s> I wasn't suggesting this.  </s>
<s> I was suggesting that we change the spec for www-url-encoded-form.  </s>
<s> I would not want to change the way binary files are transmitted!  </s>
<s> The problem is that netscape is saying it is sending a content length of 36 bytes but actually transfering 38.  </s>
<s> This is a bug IMHO.  </s>
<s> Whenever a length of 36 is stated it should mean 36.  </s>
<s> If Netscape is sending a bogus CRLF after binary files then I would expect problems to arise in any case.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> Perl's getline (or STDIN , etc) uses both CRLF or EOF - when a server is receiving POST data, and it has received as many bytes as the content-length header says it should have received, doesn't the server close the stdin pipe to the CGI script?  </s>
<s> Or is it left up to the CGI script to start responding autonomously?  </s>

<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> By the way, I encountered this last Fall while working out the keep-alive support in WebSite 1.1.  </s>
<s> My solution was to accept blank lines prior to the start of the next HTTP request.  </s>
<s> My implementations also accept blank lines before the start of the next request.  </s>
<s> However lets be really clear.  </s>
<s> When you say Content length the data stream must be exactelly as follows: (Note: I am making each CR and LF explicit.  </s>
<s> Ignore line endings, they are just for convenience) POST / HTTP/1.1 Content-Length: X CR LF More-Headers: yyyy CR LF GET / HTTP/1.1 etc... NOTE: The GET is the second request.  </s>
<s> The following is non-compliant with every current proposal (Please fix this for HTTP 1.1 implementations!) POST / HTTP/1.1 Content-Length: X CR LF More-Headers: yyyy CR LF GET / HTTP/1.1 Alex Hopmann ResNova Software, Inc. hopmann@holonet.net  </s>
<s> Well, my client's staff and I have spend something between 40 and 200 person hours tracking down and resolving a problem in our server like product caused by these two bytes which we didn't realize existed.  </s>
<s> If only I'd been current on my e'mail ....  -:).  </s>
<s> The symptom was that our code running on Win/95's winsock would leave the two bytes hanging and close the connection.  </s>
<s> Since the winsock stack would know it had two unreceived bytes, it would apparently do a RST instead of FIN.  </s>
<s> This resulted in NETSCAPE complaining about the connection being reset by the peer.  </s>
<s> Interstingly, if we inserted a delay before the close, then apparently NETSCAPE would close first and never complain.  </s>
<s> I have no idea what stimulated the thought that it might be outstanding receive data which caused the problem we were seeing but we tried alomst everything else first.  </s>
<s> In summary, I'm not sure it would be practical to change the content length or remove the characters but their existance surely *MUST* be documented, and if perchance we have to make more edits on 1.0 we should add a comment there as well.  </s>
<s> My inclination is to document the content as being followed by optional trailers whose end is indicated by a NULL line.  </s>
<s> Current programs and CGIS keep working and new applications which might expect such trailers can work as well.  </s>
<s> perl code *CAN* be written to not require trailing CR/LF but it is more complex so new applications could be made to work.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> [tail* of woe deleted]  </s>
<s> This does not work because there are still a large number of clients which read until the close of connection.  </s>
<s> Footers can incorporate whitespace but text characters would appear en-screen.  </s>
<s> I would like to see footers on all messages but I think that this is only currently practical with chunked :-( Perhaps we simply define messages as having optional CRLF sequences for the time being.  </s>
