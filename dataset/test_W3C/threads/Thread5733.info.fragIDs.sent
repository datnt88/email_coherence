<s> There seems to be a hole in the coverage of OWL.  </s>
<s> More specifically, given classes 'A', 'B', and 'C', a property 'has', and the "reality" that A has B and optionally has C, and that B is distinct from C, it does not seem possible to model this situation in OWL.  </s>
<s> Some considerations: Renaming 'has' to 'has-an-A' and 'has-a-B' appears to be a non-starter.  </s>
<s> The property has already been named in the "reality" that is being modelled.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I am translating from an E-R model, or from UML.  </s>
<s> Where is the information about this gratuitous renaming going to go?  </s>
<s> Perhaps I don't own the namespace of the property.  </s>
<s> If the example seems contrived, look at the WSA, where there appear to be cases just like this.  </s>

<s> Class(C) ObjectProperty(has domain(A) range(unionOf(B C))) which contradicts the fact that having C is optional.  </s>
<s> Jeff  </s>
<s> Jeff, by *not* mentioning A has someValuesFrom C at all is effectively saying that A optionally has C. The semantics is that everything is possible (i.e. it is optional that A has C, B could be equivalent to A, or to C... A could be a subclass of C etc etc ).  </s>
<s> Just like if you don't say B is distinct from C, then the semantics is that B could be intersecting with C. To say what you want, I believe the following is enough: Ontology( Class(A restriction(has someValuesFrom (B)) Class(B not (C) Class(C) ObjectProperty(has domain(A) range(unionOf(B C)) Cheers, Gary Network Inference (Holdings) Ltd.  </s>

<s> Hi Jeff, (this is probably the wrong ML for a reply but I'll give it a try..) why don't you just remove the "someValuesFrom C" from your ontology.  </s>
<s> then "has" can relate individuals of type A to either individuals of type B or type C. keeping "someValuesFrom B" ensures that A has at least one B. if C is optional, the range definition is sufficient.  </s>

<s> or did you mean that it's not possible to attach cardinalities to value constraints (e.g.  </s>
<s> A 3x has B)? DAML+OIL has this type of qualified constraints, IIRC, but I'm not sure.  </s>

<s> Ok, the hole is getting smaller (or the owl is getting bigger, depending on your perspective).  </s>
<s> The suggestion to reason about the optional 'A has C' from the range definition is a good one.  </s>
<s> But this only works well when the domain of the property is just A. If the domain is also a union of classes (e.g. in the WSA case already mentioned) then a lot of other unintended inferences pop out.  </s>

<s> More specifically, given classes 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', a property 'has', and the "reality" that A has B and optionally has C, and that B is distinct from C, and that D has E, how do I say that A doesn't have E, and that C doesn't have B or C? Jeff  </s>
