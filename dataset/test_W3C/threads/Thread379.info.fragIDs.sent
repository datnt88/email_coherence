<s> Hi all, I've been experimenting with the output of Word 2000, when using the "export to compact HTML" and "save as web page" features.  </s>
<s> What I'd like is to end up with well-formed XML, but the tidy options I've been using don't always give me what I'd expect.  </s>
<s> Tidy makes a heroic effort on the giant mess Word produces, but I need all attributes to be quoted and no repeated attributes.  </s>
<s> For example, Word seems to produce a lot of : Which I need as: Has anybody else had any experiences they could share?  </s>
<s> Stu  </s>
<s> Tidy's word-2000 option is draconian and strips out the class, lang and style attributes, see PurgeAttributes().  </s>
<s> It also strips out width attributes from th and td.  </s>
<s> This was based upon an inspection of the markup produced by the save as web page export filter from Word2000.  </s>
<s> I figured it would be more cost effective to strip these out and to later add back in class attributes manually.  </s>
<s> I would be interested to get suggestions for improvements.  </s>

<s> How about a way to remove duplicate atttributes in XML output?  </s>
<s> The Word X/HTML seems to have a lot of : If these repeats could be optionally removed, we'd be close to having a very useful Word 2000 == X/HTML == XML workflow!  </s>
