<s> thanks for your careful reading of the documents and the comments.  </s>
<s> I made the word changes you suggested to the overview document that were not already in the editors draft.  </s>
<s> I did not make the "members" to "participants" change since there are some people who are members of the working group although I have never seen them participate.  </s>
<s> (I did made the working group to Working Group change.)  </s>
<s> I will ask internally for one consistent phrasing for the last paragraph within all of the working group documents.  </s>
<s> The Overview document update is in its usual editors draft location - Concerning the paragraph in the Guide section you mention below, I can rewrite it but I had never heard of "IANA reserved sites per RFC 2606" before.  </s>
<s> I do need some examples in that section and could provide more description and drop the URLs for which I can not control persistance if that is preferable.  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting taking the functional url example - non functional url you mention wine-portal.example.com  </s>
<s> that has the appropriate naming?  </s>
<s> This means that people could not click through to the site and would just mean I need to do a bit more description in the  </s>
<s> example.  </s>
<s> thank you, Deborah  </s>
<s> "Participant" is the W3C Process Document term used instead of "member" to differentiate from "W3C Members."  </s>
<s> I ought to have mentioned that.  </s>
<s> Yes, that's exactly right.  </s>
<s> Thanks very much.  </s>
<s> (The reasons for this request are one non-RFC domain in another spec causing harm when it changed hands, and a domain that is something of a surprise, that was used in the CSS1 Recommendation.) If can help let me know.  </s>

<s> [S&amp;AS] Is the one I've used OK for OWL Test Cases.  </s>
<s> For many earlier drafts , not having a compound document was perceived as a problem.  </s>
<s> The current solution involves generating the three single document versions M.html L.html and XXL.html and then xslt-ing the (informative) XXL.html version with the script below to make the normative compound document.  </s>
<s> However, I didn't find any guidance as to W3C policy for such things, and basically just copied S&amp;AS and some other TR but I forget which.  </s>
<s> I would be happy to entertain changes to the xslt, less happy with suggestions that could not easily be addressed that way.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Susan, Thanks for the careful read.  </s>
<s> Re your comments on the Guide.  </s>
<s> I have corrected all the typos, members- participants, and am nearly done with the references.  </s>
<s> I am using the citation form suggested.  </s>
<s> While it turns out to be a little verbose, I agree with the rationale.  </s>
<s> The references particularly needed fixing and I now need to run through the various verifiers before publishing to the web site.  </s>
