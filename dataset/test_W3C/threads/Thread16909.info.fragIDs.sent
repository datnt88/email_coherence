<s> Hi, I'm just finishing up a project where we checked web page accessibility for blind users by phone.  </s>
<s> Basically, each blind subject was on a conference call with the testers.  </s>
<s> There were a couple of benefits to this approach.  </s>
<s> It reduced the amount of set up time because the blind subject was able to work with his/her standard accessibility configuration.  </s>
<s> Another benefit was that it significantly reduced testing costs like travel while increasing the number of testers.  </s>
<s> I've been asked to take our notes and produce a document describing the approach taken so it can be used in some other projects.  </s>
<s> I was thinking it might be good to include any testing approaches that other people may have taken.  </s>
<s> So far the only significant description of testing web pages by blind subjects seems to be the one written by the Norman-Nielsen group.  </s>
<s> If you know of any other or have your own approach, I would very much appreciate hearing about them.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Scott  </s>
<s> Hi, Well, other blind people think that time can be an issue for accessibility.  </s>
<s> (I also suspect they probably think they are right just like other blind people believe they are right.) Scott  </s>
<s> accessibility means that it is available and can be used.  </s>
<s> time is not a deciding factor in this.  </s>
<s> Other factors as has been indicated on this thread address the time issue.  </s>
<s> I agree with Scott - how much longer something takes because of a disability-related scenario is an accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> This is where accessibility and usability can be seen to be on the same continuum.  </s>
