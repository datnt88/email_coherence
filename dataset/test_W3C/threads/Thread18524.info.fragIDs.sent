<s> Ian Jacobs wrote, in response to harvey's request: quote  </s>
<s> i nagged you to insert them into UAAG, but at the _end_ of each section, not at the beginning as they were (once) implemented... the reason they weren't practical was that, being placed at the beginning, they were one of the first things that one saw/heard/felt when one jumped directly to a Guideline, rather than providing the reader with the opportunity to do something (back one guideline, forward to next guideline, return to Table of contents) when he or she had finished perusing the document... that was the only basis of my complaint--that the enhanced navigational features had been improperly implemented, _NOT_ that they weren't useful, as i find such supplemental/recurring navigational functionality a great aid in efficaciously traversing a large hypertext document--and UAAG definitely qualifies as a "large hypertext document"  </s>
<s> moreover, although the table of content can ostensively be accessed via the accesskey associated with it (in this instance, the character "c"), accesskey (as we all well know) isn't very widely supported, and where it is supported, it doesn't always work as intended (nor consistently between releases)... hyperlinks, however, are--at least the last time i checked--are pretty ubiquitously supported, which is another compelling reason to restore the "previous guideline", "table of contents", and "next guideline" links... thanks for the catch, harvey--i've been relying on the plain text version of UAAG for the past several months for a variety of reasons, and i'm glad someone else noticed the document's need for enhanced navigational aids... gregory.  </s>

<s> aloha, ian!  </s>
<s> thanks, as usual, for your expeditious replies... in reference to the issue of embedded navigational links, you wrote, quote a) If you are at the end of Guideline N and wish to read Guideline N+1, I don't see the need for a next guideline link; you simply go to the next line of text.  </s>
<s> b) It would seem like what would be useful is "back to the beginning of this same guideline".  </s>
<s> Maybe "previous guideline" is useful.  </s>
<s> Back to the TOC is fine too.  </s>
<s> unquote you have a valid point about reaching Guideline N+1 from the end of Guideline N... i've wrestled with similar predicaments in the past, when marking up directories and other documents where there are many sub-sections, but whenever i've left out or removed "Next Section" links, users of those documents complained to me that there wasn't a "Next" link... why?  </s>
<s> because there is actually a very good reason for including a "Next Guideline" link--if it is the first link in a sub-navigational grouping of links, it serves as that grouping's "Skip Navigational Links" link, for, since the user encounters it first, he or she can use it to jump over the remaining navigational links without scrolling or otherwise manually manipulating the viewport... personally, i would be quite satisfied if users were presented with the following options upon reaching the end of a guideline--for argument's sake, Guideline 5: 1. "Return to the beginning of Guideline 5" 2. "Previous Guideline" 3. "Table of Contents" but having the "skip navigational links" functionality that a "Next Guideline" link provides, i think, would be worth the effort it would take to add it to the script... gregory.  </s>
