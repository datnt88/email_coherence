<s> I'm sorry to see members of the WG taken by surprise on this topic.  </s>
<s> I for one thought it was obvious long ago, and never hidden or disguised, that the restrictions on comments, entity types, content models, and attribute declarations would require the preparation of XML-compatible versions of standard entity sets from ISO and elsewhere,  </s>
<s> as well as of XML-compatible versions of standard DTDs like Docbook, TEI, and HTML.  </s>
<s> So I'm neither surprised nor shocked by Peter Murray-Rust's discovery, though I am alarmed to see that some members of the WG seem surprised by it.  </s>
<s> The preparation of XML-compatible versions of these files is (a) not hard, and (b) something that need be done only once.  </s>
<s> It seems to me a very small price indeed to pay for the simplifications we get in declaration syntax and entity handling.  </s>
<s> So, with respect, I suggest that any proposals to - start allowing comments in arbitrary SGML declarations - return to the use of -- -- com delimiters - remove the restrictions on content models which will make many existing DTDs break with XML parsers - restore the SDATA entity type need some further motivation before we reopen these questions.  </s>
<s> We knew  </s>
<s> when we made the original decision that existing SGML DTDs and entity sets use these constructs.  </s>
<s> We knew that eliminating the constructs would mean making new XML-compatible versions of the files we all use.  </s>
<s> Nothing has changed.  </s>
<s> Is there a reason to revisit the decisions?  </s>
<s> -C. M. Sperberg-McQueen University of Illinois at Chicago  </s>
<s> Those will have to be explained to an existing user base who possess some rather expensive tools and substantial SGML legacy.  </s>
<s> All they actually want is an SGML browser and database tools for the Internet.  </s>
<s> It is a sideways compatibility issue.  </s>
<s> Moving to XML is not an upgrade to SGML.  </s>
<s> It is a crab walk into a different standard, language and system.  </s>
<s> So, deciding to do it raises serious issue of maintenance and tools.  </s>
<s> These changes, unless explained with hefty benefits, will result in the rejection of XML by some users.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the early adopters of XML will likely come from the SGML community who have an immediate need.  </s>
<s> Typically, I've seen this problem met by freeware for conversion.  </s>
<s> From VRML 1.0 to 2.0, many syntax changes occurred that looked  </s>
<s> gratuitous.  </s>
<s> SGI, Sony, and some editor vendors responded with automatic conversion routines.  </s>
<s> Mileage varies.  </s>
<s> The difference in this situation is the size of the legacy to be considered, and the impact on the existing base of tools.  </s>
<s> I am not surprised.  </s>
<s> But, unless met with explanations that are the changes are practical and beneficial, there will be some serious questions raised by the SGML user community.  </s>
<s> Newbies won't care.  </s>
<s> This will be hard where the nature of the changes or the accruing benefits are either esoteric or so technical the audience gives up and looks for alternatives.  </s>

<s> I got the impression from 2-3 mails that this had surprised people and I am sorry if I have raised an issue that had been put to bed.  </s>
<s> My reaction is that it will create a lot of work and potentially some confusion.  </s>
<s> Not everyone will initially understand the reason for two sets of entity sets which differ only by asterisks and they may occasionally muddle them up.  </s>
<s> If this is recognised and accepted, that's fine.  </s>
<s> I accept that for large well-financed organisations this isn't a problem.  </s>
<s> Nor is it a problem for people who are developing a complete XML solution without any reference to existing SGML.  </s>
<s> The problem will hit those who (like me) are on the fringes of the SGML community and who have to make do with what bits and pieces they can pick up.  </s>
<s> My own position is that my DTD (CML) is (now) not interoperable with XML.  </s>
<s> The problem is not primarily technical.  </s>
<s> The components that CML interoperates  </s>
<s> with belong to other organisations who own the copyright and for each of which I shall have to get permission to alter and redistribute the material.  </s>
<s> Whilst I am sure this will come in time, it's not something that a single individual is likely to make much headway with.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I cannot legally distribute my material in XML-form (unless I have misunderstood this).  </s>
<s> I will predict that what will happen is that people will develop XML software  </s>
<s> which has switches on the command line, that allow it to read 'SGML' entity sets, rather than the confusion of interoperating with 'SGML' sets and 'XML' sets in neighbouring directories.  </s>
<s> No :-) But it would be a useful thing for those of us who are trying to develop software to have the definitive XML versions of the common DTDs and entity sets.  </s>
<s> At present my XML development is stalled until this happens.  </s>
<s> P. Peter Murray-Rust, domestic net connection Virtual School of Molecular Sciences  </s>
<s> I concur completely with Michael.  </s>
<s> No-one has ever said that existing legacy SGML (or HTML) files will be valid XML files.  </s>
<s> They won't.  </s>
<s> The conversion is automatic and trivial.  </s>
<s> The !--* comment syntax *-- came from me, and is a sort of  </s>
<s> transition syntax: you can use this in SGML today, as any SGML parser will accept it as a comment that just happens to contain the stars.  </s>
<s> If'when SGML is enhanced to allow different start and end comment delimiters, this comment syntax lets you include -- in comments.  </s>
<s> Also, yes, it looks familiar to C programmers, and there are a lot of us.  </s>
<s> No, none of these files will break.  </s>
<s> They are all SGML files, and are not for use with XML.  </s>
