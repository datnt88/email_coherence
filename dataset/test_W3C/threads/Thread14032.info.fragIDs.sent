<s> OPEN ISSUES: On 9 July, I documented resolutions [1] to the issues cited.  </s>
<s> I believe all to be resolved except issue #3. [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0006.html  </s>
<s> Issue #3: Should user agents be able recognize markup for navigation bars  </s>
<s> Addressed in [1], but here's more info: There are two parts to this issue, I believe: recognition of arbitrary classification of navigation bars and recognition for known HTML markup.  </s>
<s> I believe the UA WG has (or should) punt on the former goal.  </s>
<s> In another version of the Guidelines, we can talk more about schemas as a good way to identify document component semantics.  </s>
<s> For the latter goal, Charles has proposed MAP as the proper solution and Wendy responded [1] that the GL Group had already decided not to recommend this solution.  </s>
<s> So the issue could be opened again in GL. [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0012.html  </s>
<s> COVERAGE OF UNTIL USER AGENT CLAUSES Reference Document: 16 July Draft of UAGL [2].  </s>
<s> [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990716/ 1) WCAG 1.5: Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side image map links, provide redundant text links for each active region of a client-side image map.  </s>
<s> Comment: While we have several checkpoints that might cover this, including "1.2 Ensure that the user can interact with all active elements of a document in a device-independent manner."  </s>
<s> we don't have a checkpoint specifically for client-side image maps.  </s>
<s> I propose we list this as an example after checkpoint 1.2 in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> 2) WCAG 5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when linearized. Comment: The WG has decided not to include a checkpoint requiring that UAs be able to linearize tables (I believe in [3]).  </s>
<s> [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1998/12/wai-ua-f2f-19981211.html#media  </s>
<s> Instead, the following checkpoints should cover this issue: 7.1 Ensure that the user has access to document content, including alternative representations of content.  </s>
<s> 7.2 For dependent user agents.  </s>
<s> Ensure that the user has access to the content of an element selected by the user 8.3 For dependent user agents.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to navigate among table cells of a table (notably left and right within a row and up and down within a column).  </s>
<s> 3) WCAG 7.1 Until user agents allow users to control flickering, avoid causing the screen to flicker.  </s>
<s> Comment: The WG decided [3.5] that since flicker was caused by scripts, that the following checkpoint ensured control: [3.5] 5.8 Allow the user to turn on and off support for scripts and applets.  </s>
<s> 4) WCAG 7.2 Until user agents allow users to control blinking, avoid causing content to blink (i.e., change presentation at a regular rate, such as turning on and off).  </s>
<s> Comment: This is covered by the following checkpoint: 5.6 Allow the user to turn on and off animated or blinking text.  </s>
<s> 5) WCAG 7.3 Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content, avoid movement in pages.  </s>
<s> Comment: This may either be caused by style sheets or scripts.  </s>
<s> Thus, checkpoint 5.8 and the following cover the issue: 5.9 Allow the user to turn on and off support for user style sheets.  </s>
<s> 6) WCAG 7.4 Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do not create periodically auto-refreshing pages.  </s>
<s> Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint: 5.14 Allow the user to turn on and off automatic page refresh.  </s>
<s> 7) WCAG 7.5 Until user agents provide the ability to stop auto-redirect, do not use markup to redirect pages automatically.  </s>
<s> Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint: 5.13 Allow the user to turn on and off author-specified page forwards that occur after a time delay and without user intervention.  </s>
<s> 8) 10.1 Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user.  </s>
<s> Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint: 5.11 Allow the user to turn on and off support for spawned windows.  </s>
<s> 9) WCAG 10.2 Until user agents support explicit associations between labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.  </s>
<s> Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint: 9.24 Provide the user with access to any label explicitly associated with a form control.  </s>
<s> Note: Preserved in orientation proposal [4] [4] 10) WCAG 10.3 Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render side-by-side text correctly, provide a linear text alternative (on the current page or some other) for all tables that lay out text in parallel, word-wrapped columns.  </s>
<s> Comment: Although this is more about user agents getting it right rather than ensuring some functionality, this is covered by 7.2.  </s>
<s> 11) WCAG 10.4 Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas.  </s>
<s> Comment: I don't think we have anything to do here.  </s>
<s> This was to account for incorrect legacy UA behavior.  </s>
<s> 12) WCAG 10.5 Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render adjacent links distinctly, include non-link, printable characters (surrounded by spaces) between adjacent links.  </s>
<s> Comment: I believe this is covered by 7.2 and possibly the 9.5 proposed in [4].  </s>
<s> 13) WCAG 13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.  </s>
<s> Comment: This is only covered if you consider that support for W3C Recommendations (checkpoint 11.2) will ensure implementation of metadata (HTML metadata, RDF).  </s>
<s> I would consider this an open issue: how to handle metadata.  </s>
<s> 14) 13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group.  </s>
<s> Comment: I don't believe we have a checkpoint for this.  </s>
<s> We could add one to Guideline 8 on Navigation.  </s>
<s> More than "could be" it seems.  </s>
<s> It's definitely on the agenda for a meeting on 26 August, according to Al  </s>
