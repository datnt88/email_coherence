<s> 2.1.a  </s>
<s> Should we allow link recognition via a reserved attribute?  </s>
<s> 2.1.b  </s>
<s> If so, should we generalize this and say that it's an AF? 2.1.c  </s>
<s> If so, should we provide an introduction to AF's?  </s>
<s> 2.1.d  </s>
<s> If we allow such recognition, what should the attribute be, and what should be the values for each element type we define?  </s>

<s> And we don't need to drag HyTime in to explain that.  </s>
<s> Amen.  </s>
<s> It should be named 'XML-form'  </s>
<s> Do we propose an AF for what users and authors currently call "forms" (ie fill-in forms a la HTML FORM )?  </s>
<s> I foresee infinite confusion here.  </s>
<s> I don't much care what name is picked, but no leading or trailing hyphens.  </s>
<s> But if we could find a reason to use blink it would be so amusing!  </s>
<s> Maybe Eve could revisit "butt" wrt "link" with a view to this :-) ///Peter  </s>
<s> And we don't need to drag HyTime in to explain that.  </s>
<s> Dead wrong.  </s>
<s> First, "drag in" is inflamatory not helpful.  </s>
<s> If it is an arch form, then referencing ISO 10744 does not hurt.  </s>
<s> Second, when SGML Lite is established by ISO, it makes the relationship clear and concise.  </s>
<s> Y'all are wandering into the weeds of religion and personal animosities.  </s>
<s> It won't help.  </s>
<s> len  </s>
<s> And we don't need to drag HyTime in to explain that.  </s>
<s> I meant that if we are taking a significantly shrunken subset of HyTime Architectural Forms [for instance, I think we can and should avoid any restrictions on content models], then it may be simpler to explain what we are doing directly, rather than pointing at HyTime, and explaining the differences.  </s>
<s> If you are defining a scripting language containing only the commands "if-then-else", expressions, variable assignment and "while" loops, pointing to C++ and saying what to ignore is not a productive explanatory strategy.  </s>
<s> You might mention that C++ compaitibility is a goal, but that would be additional information for the intersted, not part of the core explanation.  </s>
<s> "Drag in" was intended to say that making normative reference to irrelevant information is bad.  </s>
<s> In a separate message (maybe the same, for  </s>
<s> all I remember) I clearly advocated retaining a reference to HyTime, and it's AF facilities.  </s>
<s> I personally think it was a mistake to try to standardise them for applicability beyond HyTime, but they exist and we should not hide that fact.  </s>
<s> I'm not trying to supress the HyTime links -- HyTime has been very influential in forming how at least some of us think  </s>
<s> about this stuff -- but I do want to make XML, and XML linking stand on their own, without normative references to ISO standards.  </s>
<s> No personal animosity intended, nor religious argument either.  </s>
<s> I'm religious about separating declaration and processing (though if we don't define sufficiently powerful processing, I agree with you, we are SOL).  </s>
<s> I'm certainly not religious about HyTime either way.  </s>
<s> In fact, I'm aggressively agnostic.  </s>
<s> I think you may mistrust me because I'm so ready to question HyTime's specific solutions, but I don't regret having spent the time on it that I have, nor do I think it should be supressed.  </s>

<s> Then what am I to make of Eliot's assertion that XML Linking is conforming HyTime.  </s>
<s> I admit that I don't have the time to work out the details of that.  </s>
<s> I also don't like restrictions on content models.  </s>
<s> It is a lot less ugly as deRose has shown to use them for linking information.  </s>
<s> That is the sticking point.  </s>
<s> Is it irrelevant?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if that goal has any utility.  </s>
<s> Whereas, gratuitous references are not useful, normative references establish a chain of authoritative information.  </s>
<s> That does have utility.  </s>
<s> WG8 is very likely to build the SGML Lite over XML and that is a win-win for all of us.  </s>
<s> Oh, I don't distrust the questions at all.  </s>
<s> I wish we had all been doing this some years ago online and in this fevered way.  </s>
<s> But that is past.  </s>
<s> What I want to see now is a clear authoritative chain of standards expressed as running code and embraced as COTS applications.  </s>
<s> Then we can all go watch deRose ice skate.  </s>

<s> I do want to make XML, and XML linking stand on their own, without normative references to ISO standards.  </s>

<s> Whereas, gratuitous references are not useful, normative references establish a chain of authoritative information.  </s>
<s> That does have utility.  </s>
<s> David: If that is your goal, then what am I to make of Design Goal (3) "XML shall be compatibble with SGML"?  </s>
<s> What's more normative than "shall"?  </s>
<s> More ISO than SGML?  </s>
<s> Len: I agree.  </s>
<s> The kind of work I do is long-lived.  </s>
<s> For the sake of the integrity of my client's content, I want a stable reference point.  </s>
<s> Normative references, warts and all, provide that.  </s>
<s> On the internet, people scoff at the very thoguht of ISO standards because they are not willing to pay to read them.  </s>
<s> If we want XML to be accepted we must make the documents authoritative and self-standing.  </s>
<s> It is our job to make XML SGML conforming (or not).  </s>
<s> It is an implementor's job to follow what _We_ specify.  </s>
<s> We will not ease their task by making them read the ISO documents.  </s>
<s> That's the difference between an informative, and a normative citation.  </s>
<s> If it is normative, we require thaqt they read both.  </s>
<s> I think that this is socially, and politially unacceptable, and technically unnecessary.  </s>
<s> It is also implied by the goal of a 20page definition.  </s>
<s> If the definition is 20 pages, and makes nromative reference to 8879, we have made things _more complicated_ not _less complicated_.  </s>
<s> If we add the HyTime standard, we have compounded this problem by at least a factor of 2-3.  </s>
<s> Compatible means compatible.  </s>
<s> I can define language A as a subset of language B without making explicit reference to language B or its definition documents, so long as the definitions themselves meet the criterion.  </s>
<s> Clear enough now?  </s>
<s> -- David I agree that we should cite all relevant ISO documents for those interested in further background, or in need of features we are not providing that those standards do provide.  </s>
<s> Endorsement by the ISO is a feature that is variably rated by our target users.  </s>
