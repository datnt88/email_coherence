<s> Here is a variation on the "Only the Author can supply" approach proposed by Wendy.  </s>
<s> OTACS - 2 (Only the Author Can Supply) The minimum set for compliance (equiv to single A rating today) would be composed of those items which cannot be derived or deduced by a tool or the reader with a disability and must therefore be supplied by the author.  </s>
<s> NOTES:  </s>
<s> 1- By deduced by a tool, we mean deduced by a tool commonly available at low or no cost to the person with a disability.  </s>
<s> 2- Information that can be deduced by user or generated by a tool would not be in the minimum set.  </s>
<s> 3- What can be deduced by tools will change over time.  </s>
<s> The guidelines would be modified over time to accommodate and reflect these changes.  </s>
<s> 4 -We do not have a good way to handle the advances that occur after the guidelines are released and before the next revision.  </s>
<s> This looks like "until user agent" type problem.  </s>
<s> (Someone suggested that we put these into a special Minimum Plus category which indicates that you must do these today but that they may not be needed in the future).  </s>
<s> (Graham suggested that there were some things that might be added to minimum over time as they became practical or functional.) 5- This basically only requires authors to provide the minimum that they must because someone or something else cannot provide it.  </s>
<s> 6- We might have one or more levels above.  </s>

<s> Add another note: This also assumes that the author is using a markup  </s>
<s> language which supports the information provided.  </s>
<s> This is problematic because there is a great deal of accessibility-related information which only the author can provide -- but which cannot be encapsulated into HTML effectively.  </s>
<s> The addition of author-created XHTML modules makes things even more questionable, of course.  </s>

<s> If a tool can solve this, then it becomes an Authoring Tool or a User Agent issue, not a Web Content issue.  </s>
<s> If a tool can correctly process the information then such a tool can be run on the user's side, and it is not the author's responsibility.  </s>
<s> Therefore, there should be absolutely no WCAG 2 checkpoints/guidelines which are not "minimum set" via OTACS-2.  </s>
<s> Is this correct?  </s>
<s> Do you agree or disagree?  </s>
<s> My take on web accessibility is that ultimately the question of accessibility boils down to: (a) Knowing what information you need to provide (as an author), and (b) Knowing how to properly encode that information so it can be utilized by the end user.  </s>
<s> I maintain that the set of all checkpoints which fit this definition -- and which fit OTACS-2 -- is equal to the set of all checkpoints which belong in WCAG 2. There are no checkpoints which do not meet OTACS-2, which should nevertheless be included in WCAG 2. Therefore, this is a poor choice for distinguishing a "minimum set" of WCAG 2 checkpoints.  </s>
