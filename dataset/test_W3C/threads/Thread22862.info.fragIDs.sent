<s> Hi, I'm working with Dom level 1, xmltr2 package from sun.  </s>
<s> The following is a simple example of what I am doing but using the insertBefore() method.  </s>
<s> I'm creating a class that allows the client to add phones and computers to this hypothetical person document.  </s>
<s> I want to add new phones and computers as new Nodes after the last one in the group.  </s>
<s> If I keep a reference to the last one in the group (phones or computers) then it seems that it would be easiest and most context free to do the following.  </s>
<s> class Person { Document document; Element lastPhone; Element lastComputer; void addPhone(String number) { // assume last phone not null Node parent = lastPhone.getParentNode();  </s>
<s> Element element = document.createElement("phone");  </s>
<s> element.appendChild(document.createTextNode(number));  </s>
<s> parent.insertAfter(element,  </s>
<s> lastPhone); lastPhone = element; What I end up doing is remembering what the firstNode of computer is and do an insertBefore.  </s>
<s> This seems kind of wierd that I need to know the next unrelated element and do an insertBefore.  </s>
<s> Am I missing something?  </s>
<s> Does DOM 2 change this?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Eric :-)  </s>
<s> node.insertAfter(newKid,refChild), if it existed, would be precisely equivalent to node.insertBefore(newKid,refChild.getNextSibling()).  </s>
<s> Note that inserting before null means inserting at the end of the list, so the Right Thing should happen even in that case.  </s>
<s> Also note that a shorthand in that case is node.appendChild(newKid).  </s>
<s> So insertAfter might be convenient, but isn't strictly necessary.  </s>
<s> Which is why we left it out of Level 1. Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> So I guess I should interpret getNextSibling() as the next node at the same level as the refChild?  </s>
<s> I thought sibling was a node with the same  </s>
<s> tagname sort of like my lastname richardson which would be the same for my siblings.  </s>
<s> So this means insert at the end based on the node's context.  </s>
<s> These are obviously errant thoughts of a DOM mortal, based on the english language, not the spec.  </s>
<s> I think I got it unless I said something really wrong.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, Eric  </s>
<s> A sibling is a node with the same parent.  </s>
<s> If you have the document a b/ c/ /a , b and c both have a as their parent.  </s>
<s> b is c's previous sibling, and c is b's next sibling.  </s>
<s> If you then issue the operation a.insertbefore(d,null), or a.appendChild(d), d will become a's last child: a b/ c/ d/ /a .  </s>
