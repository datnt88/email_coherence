<s> I'd encourage all, but particularly those participating in the conference call this afternoon, to take a look at: This is a prototype of why and how one would create a dynamic set of accessibility guidelines in order to deal with the creation of both a practical present-day guidelines and optimistic guidelines for the future on which to base authoring tool and browser manufacturer specs.  </s>
<s> The implementation fleshes out many of the ideas I've mentioned in recent postings to this list (Subj: Re: Murky ratings).  </s>

<s> Hello Josh I think it's a very useful tool for people that have a special deliverable in mind as in "doing an accessible web site that is compliant with html3.2 and NS3".  </s>
<s> I've met people with this kind of deliverable, that's just web design shop market reality, but I'm not sure that's something I'd like to see W3C endorsing in a markup guideline normative document.  </s>
<s> For one thing, I wouldn't know which combination to choose for my own pages...  </s>
<s> I'm more in favor of W3C "raising the bar" and recommending guidelines based on standard, even if this means some of them will only take their full effect in the future.  </s>
<s> I am not sure the a goal of the page authoring guidelines should be creating a set of dynamic guidelines for public consumption.  </s>
<s> I think this will be vary confusing to novices.  </s>
<s> Is this tool intend just for internal WAI usage?  </s>

<s> I think the idea of creating guidelines for Netscape 3.0 EM OR /EM Opera 3.2 or something else is a bit antithetical to the whole WAI.  </s>
<s> But the idea ofd a set of guidelines which can be dynamically interpreted is not a bad thing- especially for AT - for example it should be an AT thing not to have a BLINK or MARQUEE option available.  </s>
<s> In fact if UA's also failed to recognise the element then it would not be a problem any more.  </s>

<s> One of my goals in writing this tool was to try and begin viewing the guidelines as something more than a flat HTML file.  </s>
<s> There can be a great deal of data stored in each guideline that can help us to harness our work in creative ways.  </s>
<s> Maybe the interface I wrote obscures this.  </s>
<s> If so, I apologize.  </s>
<s> In the limiting case, by choosing "HTML 4.0" and "All ATs" the example would generate the current guidelines minus all interim issues.  </s>
<s> So in fact, if we so desired, we could generated a static document from a more general purpose mechanism for use as the formal WAI recommendation while still keeping very specific information about the ways in which each guideline is relevant.  </s>
<s> What if a person wants to see all the guidelines that are relevant to a hearing impaired audience first, or have the guidelines alternatively ranked based on how easy it is to fix them.  </s>
<s> All of these are needs which we currently have and unless we try and conceive of the guidelines as more than a flat document, I think we will have a hard time meeting our more fundamental goal of providing useful accessibility information to the varying needs of different authors.  </s>
