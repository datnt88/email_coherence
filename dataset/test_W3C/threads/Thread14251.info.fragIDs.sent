<s> Is there a way we could add a general section to the Web Content guidleines on indicating the purpose of certain elements.  </s>
<s> For example the following types of elements could indicate their purpose: Anchors: navigation link Table: layout or table Event: decorative, used for visual affects verify, checks the user input, but no visual affects functional, is used to change content of the document  </s>

<s> Jon, There are two mappings at issue here: 1) For an HTML element, what topics are related to it?  </s>
<s> This is addressed by the HTML index in the Techniques Document.  </s>
<s> For example, for the A element, the related HTML topics are "Keyboard Access" and "Links" 2) For a topic, what HTML elements/attributes are involved?  </s>
<s> I think that the table of contents combined with the HTML index covers this need as well (although not as efficiently).  </s>
<s> For more information about elements or topics, I think that users should consult the HTML specification, which describes and defines them much better than the Techniques document could.  </s>
<s> Another option is to provide a real index, which the Editors are considering.  </s>
<s> However, that would not be done until the document goes to Proposed Recommendation.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if I've addressed your point adequately, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
<s> I guess my point is more: 1.  </s>
<s> If I am an author and using a table for layout can I explicitly mark it as being used for layout that could be accessed by assisitve technology?  </s>
<s> 2. I think it is even more important for events.  </s>
<s> If I am an author using mouseover events for visual effects, can I mark this event to say that it is probably not an important event for a non-viusal interface.  </s>
