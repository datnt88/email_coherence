<s> Let's start with a simple case as much to find out what a use case is: Suppose an application wishes to find the resources in a knowledge base for people with the name "John Smith".  </s>
<s> The knowledge base is a collection of vCards in RDF (see [1] for RDF version, see [2] for the definition) e.g. an address book or an enterprise directory.  </s>
<s> vCards have a property vcard:FN (FN is "Formatted Name" I think) so we want those things with a value of "John Smith" for property vcard:FN.  </s>
<s> (I used vCards in this example just because its one we use in the Jena tutorials and find it easy to communicate to people.) Andy [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-vcard-rdf-20010222/ [2] ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2426.txt  </s>
<s> Very good starting point.  </s>
<s> Formally may I suggest we could use logic programming notation such (X, FN:name, "John Smith")  </s>
<s> The evaluation result would then be either bindings for X or if closure is a requirement, we would return all triples with X bound to a different value.  </s>
<s> I would like to see closure implemented with the query language in order to enable refined queries over the result graph.  </s>

<s> This is a good start, but it's not clear to me how the customer/client gets value yet.  </s>
<s> If you take the system I work on, cwm, and ask it ?WHO vcard:FN "John Smith".  </s>
<s> it'll dutifully bind ?WHO to _:bnode23o4u23 and report [ vcard:FN "John Smith" ]. i.e. yes, there is somebody/something that has vcard:FN "John Smith".  </s>
<s> Gee thanks.  </s>
<s> The user probably wants his contact info, if he's using the vcard namespace.  </s>
<s> Could you (or somebody...) flesh this example out a bit?  </s>
<s> Tell me more about the user... are they trying to find John Smith's email message to send them email?  </s>
<s> Or are they trying to bust John Smith for some crime?  </s>
<s> Or invite him to a party?  </s>

<s> Can you motivate this feature with a use case?  </s>

<s> I think logic programming serves at this point as a nice abstract syntax for which we can find the concrete syntax later.  </s>
<s> I don't expect feature request arise in this format but I could imagine that within this WG we find this notation easy to formalize the feature.  </s>
<s> Is this a good assumption?  </s>
<s> == Task &amp; Roles A client software wishes to connect to server software to find out if it could find an object whose property matches certain value.  </s>

<s> If the query result is a graph, the client can cache  </s>
<s> the query result and run another query over the query result.  </s>
<s> This is far more efficient than repeating the query over to the server again with more criteria set.  </s>
<s> == Description Looking for content which is written in French (X, dc:language, "fr") and returning all known properties for X should be a complete graph with (X, P1, V1), (X, P2, V2), ... , (X, Pn, Vn) for which another query can be run upon with e.g. additional constraint (X, dc:creator, "John Smith") set.  </s>

<s> It doesn't appeal to me, at this point.  </s>
<s> I expect to formalize features in a design document, not in a use cases and requirements document.  </s>
<s> This is getting there, but it's still too abstract for me... too many greek letters: "a client software", "a server", "the query", "a graph", "known properties", X, P1, P2, V1, V2, ... The french language is a nice, concrete topic that I'd expect our audience to be familiar with.  </s>
<s> dc:language is a little geeky, but certainly something we can expect our readers to learn with a couple paragraphs of explanation.  </s>
<s> Could you please pick one particular scenario built out of more concrete things like the french language, the concept of "composer" and such?  </s>
<s> This http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheFairyTale pattern seems particularly relevant to our task... "Structure the use case description as a fairly tale with an initiating event (Once upon a time there was an actor who wanted?.), a sequence of events describing the interaction of the actors with the story (and then the big bad actor?) that describes how the goal is reached ( and they all lived happily ever after).  </s>
