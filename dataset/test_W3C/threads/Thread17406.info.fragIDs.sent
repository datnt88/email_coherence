<s> Hiya Julie I'm not sure why you say the site is fixed at 800 pixels wide to avoid horizontal scrolling.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'm missing something, but you should be aware that there are millions of displays out there that are less than 800 pixels wide.  </s>
<s> Also don't forget that users with displays set at 800 pixels wide may not have their browser fully maximised to use their entire window space.  </s>
<s> As for drop-down menus, you could consider placing radio buttons in your form instead.  </s>
<s> Then, you could use the full data field in both English and Welsh as the form data, and place a cut-off or even full text caption next to it.  </s>
<s> This would allow the text to wrap onto the next line at the right-hand edge of the browser window.  </s>
<s> Use of the ellipsis would be a good idea if you decide to truncate the text placed after the radio button.  </s>
<s> You could have your server-side script truncate the English at one set number of characters, and the Welsh at another.  </s>
<s> You'd probably want more in the Welsh version anyway.  </s>
<s> Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerych... :o) I would suggest that the "user-friendly" limit of characters is based on your content and not an arbitrary rule.  </s>
<s> It all depends on context.  </s>
<s> Finally, you could also consider returing the address data in table format.  </s>
<s> Imagine a data table with several columns.  </s>
<s> The first column would contain the relevant radio button, the second column the street address, the third column the town, fourth for county, fifth for post code.  </s>
<s> That would make it less likely to rely entirely on the last part of the address, would format your data nicely, and provide your readers an easier method to scan the addresses.  </s>
<s> I couldn't tell if you are intending on returning English and Welsh addresses simultaneously, or as a separate option i.e. Welsh only or English only.  </s>

<s> Hi. First, I agree with comments by Jaz-Michael King.  </s>
<s> I wonder where the requirement to use dropdowns is coming from but you probably have your reasons.  </s>
<s> Are the addresses mentioned in your mail postal addresses (as I would assume) or perhaps URI addresses?  </s>
<s> (If they were URIs, you probably would not even think of truncating them.  </s>
<s> Long URIs are problematic in a way that they don't contain spaces and thus don't wrap nicely even if presented in an other way than dropdown lists.) How about adding a textarea to your form, presenting truncated addresses in the dropdown lists and using some scripting to show the full address of the selected option in the textarea?  </s>
<s> [1] To ensure that the application is accessible also without JavaScript, you could initially add full addresses to option texts and truncate them using JavaScript.  </s>
<s> (Maybe even use JavaScript to add the textarea to the form.) Contact me if you find this suggestion interesting and require assistance in making it work.  </s>
<s> Samuel [1] Code example (untested): onchange="this.form.real_addr.value=this[this.selectedIndex].value"  </s>
