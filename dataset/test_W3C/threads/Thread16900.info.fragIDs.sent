<s> Many of the guidelines, checklists, and validation tools mention that you should not only validate by using an automated tool, but also using manual validation by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> I thoroughly searched the WAI website but could not find anything on how and / or where to do that.  </s>
<s> I sometimes see request of webpage authors on this list if someone can have at look at their site, but I wonder if this list is the place for such requests.  </s>
<s> Just imagine that accessibility becomes a well known issue amongst web authors, then a couple of hundred maybe thousands of such requests would be posted here.  </s>
<s> Microsoft products are susceptible to a large variety of viruses, worms, and other fauna.  </s>
<s> There are two issues here.  </s>
<s> One is the need for manual validation, and the other who should do it.  </s>
<s> It is impossible to automatically validate for accessibility, so manual validation is always needed.  </s>
<s> People with disabilities are likely to understand specific issues better than those without.  </s>
<s> And the third is what resources are available to do it.  </s>
<s> If you have a blind person, do you equip them with expensive top-of-the-range kit that can do things like "accessible" flash, or something affordable to real-life users?  </s>
<s> A sweeping generalisation:-)  </s>
<s> This is true, particularly where you are presenting complex information.  </s>
<s> But those of us who don't have representatives from a broad range of disability groups amongst our colleagues have to make do with second-best.  </s>
<s> IMO a pretty good target is a three-level approach: (1) Automatic testing with Site Valet (2) Does it work as linearised text - e.g. view in in Lynx (3) Provide a prominent and accessible feedback option for people to raise any issues that remain in spite of your best efforts.  </s>
<s> Make sure someone is tasked with dealing with such feedback!  </s>
