<s> Hi there, today I have downloaded ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/amaya-2.4-1.i386.rpm for installation on a friend's PC.  </s>
<s> After the installation I was a bit disappointed to discover that the Italian dialogues  </s>
<s> are not present.  </s>
<s> As I believe this was not intentional I dare to ask: why not package amaya-2.4-2.i386.rpm with the Italian files in?  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot, Roberto  </s>

<s> Hi Roberto, We effectively forgot to add these files in the source tar file.  </s>
<s> That will be fixed in the next release.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile could you get them from a binary distribution.  </s>
<s> By the way, as you can see in the current release, Amaya on Windows  </s>
<s> platforms needs specific dialogue resources for each different language.  </s>
<s> These resources were not added in the previous release and many dialogues are missing when you use an Italian Amaya version on Windows.  </s>
<s> We plan in the next release to implement a generic mechanism for the Windows dialogue and to use the same dialogue files for Unix and Windows.  </s>
<s> I guess it will be easier to add a new dialogue language in the future.  </s>

<s> Hi, I'm an undergraduate student in the US who's designing a new web language as a thesis project.  </s>
<s> The idea is to write a very simple, HTML-like language which facilitates web page layout (an alternative to the complex and not always completely effective tables and frames of HTML).  </s>
<s> I'm hoping to implement this language with Amaya.  </s>
<s> It looks to me as though most of what I'll need to do is rewrite the HTML S, P, and T files as well as html2thot.c.  </s>
<s> Does this plan sound feasible?  </s>
<s> Am I missing any obvious problems?  </s>
<s> Do you know of resources that might be helpful to me?  </s>
<s> Any and all advice would be much appreciated.  </s>

<s> Did you look at at the new XHTML profiles and modules.  </s>
<s> I guess it's very close to what you plan to do.  </s>
<s> The plan sound feasible and you must have a look at the developer's corner in Irene.  </s>
<s> Hi, I'm adapting amaya to work with my own XML language and I'm having a problem with images.  </s>
<s> I've added a PICTURE terminal element to my S file and put an entry in the element table for my language in fetchXMLname.c that maps img tags to the PICTURE_UNIT element.  </s>
<s> After processing an img tag and successfully creating a PICTURE_UNIT element I set the text content of that element to the file name of the image source.  </s>
<s> When I run amaya and load a page with an image, no errors occur but the image does not appear.  </s>
<s> When I force the PICTURE_UNIT to have 200x200 dimensions in my P file and load the page again, I can see a bitmap with the word "picture" and a rectangle and a circle in grey and white, but my image still doesn't appear.  </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions of things I may have forgotten or done wrong?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> The Thot library needs to have a local copy of the image file for being able to display it.  </s>
<s> Have you seen the code in Amaya/amaya/HTMLimage.c that does this part of the work.  </s>
