<s> At the IETF HTTP-WG it was agreed to form sub-groups on a number of issues including Digest Authentication in HTTP.  </s>
<s> I would like to request anyone with objections to Jeff Hosteltler's draft (now expired) to make them known in the next three weeks - say January 10th?  </s>
<s> I would ask Jeff to resubmit the draft so that we can know what the proposal is.  </s>
<s> To revise people's memories Digest authentication allows a user to demonstrate that they know a password without sending it over the Internet in a form that can be decrypted.  </s>
<s> It does require servers to keep authentication databases which are sensitive in that any compromise to them will compromise their security ass access codes.  </s>
<s> This is the best that can be done without using public key however.  </s>
<s> The UNIX method of storing passwords means that passwords have to be sen over the network in the clear.  </s>
<s> digest Authentication is effectively providing Kerberos type security without a mediator.  </s>
<s> There are a few outstanding issues: 1) Should we include a mediated form of the authentication?  </s>
<s> 2) Should we specify a mechanism for defining new Keyed Digest algorithms?  </s>
<s> 3) Is Kerberos integration a practical proposition?  </s>
<s> 4) The syntax of the WWW-Authenticate: field is peculiar.  </s>
<s> We now have 2 entirely independent implementations, one in Spyglasses deployed prducts and another in the Common Lisp Web server.  </s>
<s> Since both of those products tend to get distributed on CD-ROMS there had better be a good reason behind any proposed changes.  </s>
<s> The mood at the IETF was that a subgroup go off and nail down the remaining questions and get Digest Auth rolled out ASAP.  </s>
<s> Hence the need for comments ASAP.  </s>
<s> Appologies for not getting to this sooner after the IETF, I have been busy with WWW4 which came the following week.  </s>

<s> Information Superhighway ----- Hi-ho!  </s>
<s> Yow!  </s>
<s> I'm surfing Arpanet!  </s>
<s> According to Phillip M. Hallam-Baker:  </s>
<s> The expired draft is available at  </s>
<s> There is also a digest authentication protected document there at with user name "Mufasa" and password "CircleOfLife" which can be used if you have a digest savy client.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately that does not include Netscape clients.  </s>
<s> :( John Franks  </s>
<s> by popular request, we are in the process of resubmitting the draft.  </s>
<s> it should be available tomorrow.  </s>
<s> i think jan 10 is a good goal.  </s>
<s> i think we should leave these ideas for another authentication scheme. the orignal goal of Digest was that we can do significantly better than Basic with a near-trival set of changes.  </s>
<s> we went from practically no security [uuencode("username:password")] to something with some nice properties while retaining the existing (2 party) web-model.  </s>
<s> we were also able to keep it free of patents and royalties and fully exportable and (probably) importable.  </s>
<s> i think we should be happy with it as is.  </s>
<s> yes, let's discuss this in the sub-group.  </s>
<s> whether we change the syntax or not, there's a definite need to improve the wording and eliminate some ambiguity.  </s>
<s> FYI, NCSA, John Franks, and David Kristol also have implementations.  </s>
<s> are there any others ?? jeff hostetler spyglass, inc.  </s>
