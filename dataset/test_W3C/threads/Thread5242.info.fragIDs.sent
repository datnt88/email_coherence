<s> It's not clear to me if this fits under the WorldView TF or not, maybe we need an issue list, as suggested by Brian, to keep track of public questions that we may or may not answer.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure if this counts as best practice, but we use a simulated stochastic process to determine which Semantic Web language is being used by a particular file.  </s>

<s> I think that this rather proves Ian's point - I'm using Sean's species validator behind the scenes (and a few simple and no doubt defeasible heuristics), and it reports it as OWL Full.  </s>

<s> (Discussed on SWIG) If we have a URI for the graph, then we can make statements about it, such as its intended assertional status, its intended semantic theory etc. Jeremy  </s>
