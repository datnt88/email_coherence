<s> I disagree about putting the actual rules in the advice section - as far as I can tell the language-specific rules are the criteria you need so you know if you succeeded in meeting the checkpoint, and they are potentially different for different languages.  </s>

<s> Hmm Is listing language specific methods more a techniques issue?  </s>
<s> We do have to make sure our guidelines and checkpoints make sense across languages though.  </s>

<s> No, I think it is a success criteria issue.  </s>
<s> The success criteria (if they are useful) tell you what you need to have done to know you have passed the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> For some checkpoints they may vary according to technology.  </s>
<s> For this particular checkpoint I believe they will vary accordin to language used.  </s>
