<s> Is the XML4C constantly upgraded or is that on hold and a different version that is part of the Xerces project used instead?  </s>
<s> Or are they the one and the same?  </s>
<s> This is the wrong forum for that question -- www-dom is really for discussion of the DOM itself rather than of parsers -- but as I understand it most new development goes into the Apache version, which thus always has the latest fixes ... and the latest bugs.  </s>
<s> The IBM-labelled versions (XML4C/XML4J) are released less frequently, have been tested a bit more thoroughly, and include some code that the Apache versions don't (compatbility libraries for folks using the older IBM interfaces, improved internationalization support, that sort of thing).  </s>
<s> XSLT is something I may have to look into :( Is this the forum to discuss it; especially as it will be vaguely linked to DOM questions?  </s>
<s> Quoting http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/: "Discussions about XSL are carried out on the XSL-List at mulberrytech.com and on comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets."  </s>
<s> The linkage of XSLT to DOM is, indeed, pretty vague.  </s>
<s> Some XSLT processors accept DOMs as input or produce DOMs as output, some may expose their internal models as DOMs for folks writing "extensions", and some may use the DOM as their internal model (not that anyone could ever tell from outside)... but that's about as far as it goes.  </s>

<s> Hi Guys: I need to clarify the following doubts: I. We have written a Program in Java (using SAX API) to read and write xml documents according to our requirments.  </s>
<s> Now whenever we add some new attributes to the metadata (xml file), we are forced to change our parser and writer program.  </s>
<s> Is there anyway, to write the parser and writer in such a way that it will change dynamically with the changes in metadata.  </s>
<s> Is it really possible, to achieve the above mentioned using DOM?  </s>
<s> II.  </s>
<s> DXML: I heard something like "DXML- Dynamic XML".  </s>
<s> Does this help me in doing this?  </s>
<s> Or is it totally unrelated to taks like i have mentioned above (in I).  </s>
<s> I went through a few documents abt DXML but it doesnt promise me anything of that sort.  </s>
<s> Regards Bansi Get free email and a permanent address at http://www.netaddress.com/?N=1  </s>
<s> Did a quick websearch for "dynamic XML".  </s>
<s> What I found was XML equivalents of "dynamic HTML" -- that is, combinations of XML and scripting (examples at xml.apache.org/cocoon/dynamic.html, alphaworks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/techmain/dynamicxmlforjava ), or solutions that generate XML on demand, dynamically.  </s>
<s> Neither seems to apply to this question.  </s>
