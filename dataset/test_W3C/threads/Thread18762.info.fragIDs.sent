<s> The time is right for us to make positive contributions.  </s>
<s> I have worked to specify SGML tables since 1989, for various SGML activities,including the CALS table model, and more recently as chair or co-chair of the SGML Open technical tables subcommittee.  </s>
<s> We made no accommodation to accessibility in those efforts.  </s>
<s> I hope we can rectify that omission.  </s>
<s> The International Committee for Accessible Document Design (ICADD) approach for use with SGML-tagged tables is to allow each table axis to be named, and each cell would contain the names of the set of axes that apply to it.  </s>
<s> This works well for simple tables with single initial row heads and initial column stubs.  </s>
<s> It can get messy if spanning heads or stubs apply.  </s>
<s> By default the cell content of the initial row and column could provide the axis information.  </s>
<s> The HTML table model -- is a list of rows (TR).  </s>
<s> It distinguishes table cell kinds in a row as either head (TH) or data (TD).  </s>
<s> For simplicity TH and TD may be arbitrarily intermixed in any row or column of any row.  </s>
<s> A clean table has TD for column heads in the initial row and row stubs in the initial column.  </s>
<s> All rows have every cell filled.  </s>
<s> ICADD support -- HTML 2.0 supported it.  </s>
<s> HTML 3.2 abandoned it, as the principal browser vendors did not support it.  </s>
<s> The WAI will identify means to improve accessibility to web documents for future versions of HTML.  </s>
<s> Table cell content -- may be simple, fitting into a single "line".  </s>
<s> It may wrap onto several lines.  </s>
<s> A user agent should be able to detect the wrapping and deliver the entire cell content.  </s>
<s> Table cell content -- may be complex, with substructure.  </s>
<s> Desirable for a user agent is to treat a cell as a "mini-document" so its structure would be handled as if it were a document to itself.  </s>
<s> Axis/Axes identification -- one possible way to identify the axes appropriate to any cell would be to have two distinct axis lists to represent the two coordinates of a cell.  </s>
<s> At any time the axis lists could be used individually as a selector of row or column, or in combination to select a cell.  </s>
<s> Sequential reading of cells along a row would not necessarily access the axis lists, though the reverse linking from cell to its axes should be possible.  </s>
<s> Spanning TH cells -- Table complexity results from several rows with some TH cells that horizontally span several columns.  </s>
<s> Presumably the next row would contain more TH that add additional subsidiary axis information.  </s>
<s> Analogously, several columns of initial TH cells some with vertical spanning to apply that axis information to the subsidiary row stubs.  </s>
<s> Spanning TD cells -- normally have content in only the initial cell of the spanned rectangular region of cells.  </s>
<s> What axes information applies from non-initial cell spaces?  </s>
<s> If some TH has the same span, and there are distinct subsidiary TH, omit axis info from the latter?  </s>
<s> If no TH has the same span, make composite of all axis info for any spanned?  </s>
<s> Not clear at all.  </s>
<s> TH anywhere -- the HTML table model permits TH cells anywhere in a row, not just at the beginning (or end).  </s>
<s> There is no obvious way to identify which axis or axes that cell might override for further use in subsequent cells of that row and/or column.  </s>
<s> Table linearization -- for serial delivery most assume that the table is formed as an ordered list of rows, with each having cells in columns.  </s>
<s> With that ordering, it is awkward to read skipping down a column.  </s>
<s> Non-linear positioning -- a user agent might take advantage of searching and non-linear positioning.  </s>
<s> A TD found this way would like the option to "show the axes".  </s>
<s> The alternative "hide the axes information" unless requested is also useful.  </s>
<s> Table as list -- One example from Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic is their text version of "Getting Results with Microsoft Office for Windows 95".  </s>
<s> It only had to deal with simple 2 or at most 3-column tables, with an initial row of column headers TH, and no row stub contributing to subsequent cells of the row.  </s>
<s> The linear text of the translation included for each cell of each row the TH information from the initial row as prefix to the cell TD content.  </s>
<s> In that redundant form, much more than half the tables content is cell identification.  </s>
<s> Cell content that wrapped would just appear in linear order, so there was no need to recognize that condition.  </s>
<s> There were no more complex structures used in cells.  </s>
<s> Sequential presentation -- the cost of any non-linear positioning is high for an audio tape.  </s>
<s> Thus the redundant axis identifications might be desirable.  </s>
<s> In that case, there is some advantage to being able to enable or disable the axes information presented under user control.  </s>
<s> There are no marks in the text string to facilitate this recognition and skipping.  </s>
<s> Coordinate enumeration along axis -- An effective technique borrowed from spreadsheets is to use ordered coordinate values to identify cells.  </s>
<s> The initial coordinate values of an axis are useful to retrieve the implicit axis information from those column heads or row stubs.  </s>
<s> Partial table extraction -- with adequate table-reading tools, sub-tables could be extracted, suppressing uninteresting data: 1) compressed to show only selected columns (not necessarily adjacent) 2) conditional selection based on cell values 3) transposed ordering among axes (possibly more than two) 4) projections onto 2 dimensions from higher-dimensional data (possibly by selecting N-2 two among N axes as fixed) Table cell content -- may have substructure.  </s>
<s> The user agent should handle the substructure similarly to how that same structure would be handled if it weren't in a cell.  </s>
<s> Cell boundaries -- may be deliberately visible or invisible to the sighted.  </s>
<s> When invisible, their presence is presumably evident by the regularity of the display grid for the cells.  </s>
<s> Alternative means to bound the cells are required for different representations.  </s>
<s> "Layout tables" -- The tables discussed above are "data tables", where axes provide identification for the cell content.  </s>
<s> HTML allows a cell to contain another table.  </s>
<s> HTML tables are currently being used as a "layout" hack in place of other styling tools.  </s>
<s> The axes of these layout tables is "ancestry" that may or may not need to contribute to the global axes information for the cell in which there is a "data" table.  </s>
<s> The issue is similar if frames are used for different tiled regions: should the frame identification be part of the ancestry.  </s>
<s> Multi-axis complications -- Not all cells need have the same number of axes.  </s>
<s> For example, some TH columns may have spanning TH, others need not.  </s>
<s> Cell axes needn't describe Euclidean coordinate space, even though all cells have the same number of axes.  </s>
<s> Limit to complexity -- at what point does table complexity in web documents move into a different form for their expression, such as spreadsheet or data base?  </s>

<s> Subject: Tables Accessibility [big snip] The axes of these layout tables is "ancestry" that may or may not need to contribute to the global axes information for the cell in which there is a "data" table.  </s>
<s> The issue is similar if frames are used for different tiled regions: should the frame identification be part of the ancestry.  </s>
<s> Al, here... The objective of any short-term reforms for tables should simply be to get the relationships straight between content and the descriptors that pertain to the content.  </s>
<s> Typical content is what is in a TD cell in an HTML 3.2 TABLE construct.  </s>
<s> One should be able to unambiguously determine what the user is supposted to understand about this content from the context created by the Table.  </s>
<s> Typically, the contextual information is provided by TH cells at row and column heads, Table titles, and the first mention of the table in the accompanying text.  </s>
<s> The problem that you correctly pointed out in current TABLE usage is that when a TH element appears in the interior of a table, it is not clear whether it describes TD cells below it or to its right, and it is not clear whether it refines or supercedes TH information above and to the left of it.  </s>
<s> Here I am talking about what we need to ask from server-side activities, particularly Web page authors and tools, in order that client-side activities can present the information competently for those with and without vision.  </s>
<s> The path to Mike's transparent access lies through competing invention on the client side but the client side can't get anywhere unless what the server side does supplies sufficient resources.  </s>
<s> If the content on the server is not access-compatible, there is no way the client-side tools can make the information accessible.  </s>
<s> As you pointed out, HTML 3.2 only captures enough information about the table contents to lay it out for visual communication.  </s>
<s> The communication of which TH elements apply to which TD elements depends on things that the reader will know, but are outside of the knowledge of the formal HTML encoding.  </s>
<s> If the practices at the content-sourcing end are reformed so that you can determine without a doubt what a TH pertains to, and what descriptors pertain to a TD, you will have given the client software builders the resources they need to build a dialog with the human user that works.  </s>
<s> An yes, if the table is in a frame or a cell contains a frame, frames are part of the context hierarchy that must be retrievable from any point in the browse.  </s>
<s> But that is there now.  </s>
<s> You know what frame the table is in.  </s>
<s> You don't need to encode this in any new metadata.  </s>
<s> The client software can construct the stack of descriptors that goes with the contexts as it parses the HTML.  </s>
<s> What we don't presently know is if the TH is in the interior, does it govern TD cells to its right or below it?  </s>
<s> We need to be able to construct the "focus" entities that Jim spoke of.  </s>
<s> One such focus is a TH and all the TDs or sub-tables to which it applies.  </s>
<s> If we costruct foci bottom-up in this way, then "layout tables" are supported as well as simpler structures which contain just one completely regular relation.  </s>
