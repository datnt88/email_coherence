<s> I'm afraid this completely misses the point on accessibility for people with attention deficits.  </s>
<s> I overstayed my welcome at the Dell site because, after I put the computer I wanted on my "shopping cart", my attention was distracted (by a telephone call) and, by the time I noticed/remembered that I had been on a site with a timeout, it was too late.  </s>
<s> An "extension notice" would have, ahem, escaped my notice too.  </s>
<s> It is not possible for people with attention deficits to turn off all sources of possible distraction.  </s>
<s> Every timeout is a barrier.  </s>
<s> Accessibility requires that timeouts be bypassable.  </s>
<s> The "or extend" clause would be an invitation to erect more barriers, not a way to  </s>
<s> meet accessibility needs.  </s>
<s> And it is not difficult to design bypass technologies that will still meet legitimate security and economic constraints.  </s>
<s> One easy example: to get the bypass cookie, require an  </s>
<s> e-mail address, and send a reminder to that address if a pre-set window expires.  </s>
<s> I would get the reminder the next time I check my e-mail, which is several times a day.  </s>
<s> I am open to removing the reference to photoepilepsy - accessibility for people with photoepilepsy will be assured in any case, provided that mechanisms for preventing motion are respected.  </s>

<s> Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> Timeouts such as those present in Dell's site (along with those at my former companies) are based on hard business rules on the back end.  </s>
<s> Expedia needs you to lock in your reservation so it can relay that request to the computerized reservation system it gets its data from.  </s>
<s> (And it uses meta refreshes to keep the HTTP connection alive while it contacts the slow pathetic creature.) HomeGrocer and Webvan needed to accurately manage delivery trucks and merchandise in the best possible manner.  </s>
<s> Resource management is critical in e-commerce.  </s>
<s> Ticketmaster is an extreme example: they require transactions to be completed in 5 minutes, or they release reserved tickets back into the pool.  </s>
<s> This isn't something they can change trivially, because they're using the same reservation system in stores nationwide.  </s>
<s> And auctions all have timeouts that can't be shifted.  </s>
<s> It should be noted that the only sites where this presents an economic barrier to the content provider are e-commerce sites, and it has been suggested before that web content and web applications (such as those found in e-com) have different rules.  </s>
<s> This is one rule that should definitely be applied to static content, but cannot be applied to many web applications.  </s>
<s> m  </s>
<s> I have a slightly different approach I think, or maybe I just think about it in different words.  </s>
<s> To make the thing accessible to various groups of people you need to have the option to stop the timeout.  </s>
<s> There are some cases where this is genuinely not feasible, and those things are not going to be accessible to such people.  </s>
<s> In a context such as the Disability Discrimination Act in Australia, any complaint is likely to result in a finding that the site cannot be made accessible for some external reason, and therefore is eligible for an exemption (like undue burden provisions in other situations).  </s>
<s> That doesn't mean they are accessible, it means that they are not, and cannot be, and it is not their fault.  </s>
<s> This, by the way, is the basis for having a more granular conformance profile as well as the nice simple scale of A, double-A, triple-A.  </s>
<s> Such a site may pose no problems to certain groups of people, and it would be useful to have a mechanism for stating that explicitly.  </s>
<s> EARL provides just such a mechanism.  </s>
<s> But for the most part, it is better to aim for accessibility to all, at some level, and the current scheme provides a reasonably simple approach to dealing with that.  </s>

<s> User agents may also offer control over this effect.  </s>
