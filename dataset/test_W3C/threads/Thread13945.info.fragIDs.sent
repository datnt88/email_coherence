<s> (grin) 2) I concur with the train of though that ALT and LONGDESC will see little use until they are easily and VISIBLY supported in the tools used to create web pages.  </s>

<s> 3) I think the best way to support LONGDESC in a browser is to - have the browser add a small pretty graphic icon with a D on it next  </s>

<s> - The browser can also have a setting which allows a user to HIDE D-LINKS or HIDE GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION MARKERS (D) so that anyone who doesn't like them doesn't have to see them.  </s>
<s> (they could always see if  </s>
<s> there was a LONGDESC and jump to it by right clicking on an icon and looking at the pop up menu).  </s>
<s> - If a page has a LONGDESC and an old fashioned D-LINK, then the browser could see that they pointed to the same place and hide the old  </s>

<s> and either pronounce it or skip it when reading, preferably at the users choice.  </s>

<s> Gv: Couple of thoughts on this  </s>
<s> GV: Remember that LONGDESC does not contain a long description - or any text.  </s>
<s> It contains a URL.  </s>
<s> Thus it is a link to information... not information itself  </s>
<s> GV: The suggestion I made below was that the user have the option of deciding whether a browser would place a small icon next to picture that a person could "click on" to send for a description - or - not have any icon present.  </s>
<s> (which is what could be the default behavior of the browser).  </s>
<s> Thus no one would see the little "D's" unless they set their browser to show them.  </s>
<s> GV: Having LONGDESC without a D-LINK (old kind) is not be of any benefit until browsers support LONGDESC.  </s>
<s> That may be awhile - so I'm not sure if we want to put that forward as helping today.  </s>
<s> If both are put in then the D-LINK would work for old browsers and it would disappear when the new browsers came on line (if the browsers were done as suggested).  </s>
<s> It would only be recommended though, so that no-one who doesn't want to use D-LINKS would have to.  </s>
<s> It would just be a recommendation for those who wanted to take the extra effort to do so.  </s>
<s> GV: One disadvantage of the approach I described is that the page will lay out slightly differently if the graphic D's are show or not.  </s>
<s> This may not be a big problem since people look at the pages with so many different sized screens that it lays out differently for them anyway... But it is something to think about.  </s>
<s> GV: I don't think very many people would ever want LONGDESCs inserted into the text of a page as a regular event.  </s>
<s> LONGDESCs are usually detailed information that a person occasionally wants to look at.. but usually doesn't want to read again.  </s>
<s> For example, you might be interested in the description of the logo for a company but would not want the description to be inserted into the running text wherever it occurred.  </s>
<s> GV: And all of these are just thoughts to keep us thinking an moving forward.  </s>

<s> JRG: Right, but the description information in the BODY of the URL could be inserted into the document.  </s>
<s> Just like the data in an image file URL is formed into a picture and inserted into the document.  </s>
<s> JRG: In some cases, like especially learning disabilities, I think having the image and the LONGDESC information on one page is desirable.  </s>
<s> If the only way to access LONGDESC information was to open a new document, there would be less integration of the information.  </s>
<s> JRG: I don't think this should be too much of a problem.  </s>
<s> HTML is suppose to be display independent (grin) and if somebody turns on a feature to access long description information, they will be expecting some type of accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> JRG: My main concern, as stated before, having the LONGDESC information and the original IMAGE displayed simultaneously is useful to some people with learning disabilities and TBI's.  </s>
<s> The D-Link solution provides a level of backward compatibility which is good for incouraging the inclusion of D-Links now.  </s>
<s> In reality the LONGDESC will probably be used in situations where the author is less concerned about visual formatting and so the display of the D-Link will not be visually disruptive.  </s>
<s> For example images used in highly formatted menus only need ALT text to convey the links, but a graph of information that could benefit froma LONGDESC is probably not going to be part of a high formatted structure.  </s>
<s> Do we need to have two ways (or other ways) of rendering LONGDESC information.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> Put in a D-Link if the user selects a browser option that they want to view LONGDESC information.  </s>
<s> 2. Insert LONGDESC information into the current document so that the LONGDESC information could be viewed simultaneously with the image it describes.  </s>
<s> What do people think?  </s>

<s> I don't have a third way but it seems there should be one.  </s>
<s> I'd probably like to see the long desc automatically effixed if immages are off but retain the d-link as is said for backward compatability.  </s>
<s> I also have some feeling and this seems contrary to what I said that I'd like to be able to view the info on the graphic say long desc independantly sometimes.  </s>

<s> Lynx should, by default, hide D-links unless the user explicitly requests them (with some command key).  </s>
