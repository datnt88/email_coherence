<s> With respect to: 2002-08-23#6 bwm Ensure that WG home page points to current editor working draft documents for WG review From my perspective, I don't want to have to keep updating this page, so I'd like a stable URI for the ed's working draft of each document.  </s>
<s> The current status is: Primer: The ed's working draft for the primer pointed to This however, is a directory with many files in it.  </s>
<s> Frank/Eric: do you want to leave it like this or would you prefer to have a link the latest actual doc, and if so, can you provide a URL for it (or set the directory contents up so that it default to the current version).  </s>
<s> Concepts and Abstract Data Model: Please can the editors of the Concepts and Abstact Data Model provide a stable uri for the ed's wd.  </s>

<s> We've been date-stamping the files as a means for indicating the most recent so pointing to the directory seems a useful enough means for getting people close enough to the most recent thinkings of the Primer.  </s>

<s> Is the editor's current working draft supposed to be: (a) the very latest editors' version that can be updated at any time, or (b) the most recent version stabilized for wider review?  </s>
<s> I tend to find (a) can be confusing for authors and reviewers, though it is sometimes improtant that it be available (e.g. for author collaboration).  </s>
<s> If (b) is meant, I'll need to tweak the web site where it's published, but I can do that easily enough.  </s>
