<s> There doesn't seem to be anything in the WCAG2 that deals with the issue of relative vs. absolute sizes.  </s>
<s> I know there has been some discussion of the issue but it appears that there hasn't been a resolution in either the WCAG or HTML techs documents.  </s>
<s> Don Evans was discussing the issue with me and we were unsure how to create techniques for authors.  </s>
<s> Me feeling is that there is not one simple rule that applies.  </s>
<s> Sometimes it's OK to specify sizes in pixels, for example margins.  </s>
<s> Other times it's not OK to specify sizes in pixels, for example font sizes.  </s>
<s> According to spec, pixels are defined as a relative unit of measurement, not absolute.  </s>
<s> This has clouded the issue and I wonder if we need to change our terminology to deal with this.  </s>
<s> (Hi Joe.) Cheers,  </s>

<s> Thinking about what Chris points out, I think there are a number of things we would potentially want to do to address scalability.  </s>
<s> My thoughts and proposals are below.  </s>
<s> Michael * Should the guidelines address the issue of scalability?  </s>
<s> Or should they take the perspective that it's a user agent thing and not something the _content_ guidelines should address?  </s>
<s> My vote: the guidelines should address the issue.  </s>
<s> In some technologies that may result in special author requirements (dealt with at the techniques level), in others it may not.  </s>
<s> * If we agree the guidelines should address it, where does it go?  </s>
<s> I'd say it's definately under perceivable.  </s>
<s> It's arguably related to 1.3 (separation of presentation and structure) and 1.4 (distinguish foreground from background) but not really well enough.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a new guideline under Principle 1? * What priority level should it have?  </s>
<s> I think ensuring users can scale their display would be a level 2 success criterion.  </s>
<s> * Having created the guideline we'll need to add it to HTML techniques.  </s>
<s> There's definately gonna be a browser dependency here.  </s>
<s> For Mozilla, Opera, and possibly others, we actually wouldn't need to impose any author requirements - those browser scale even absolutely sized elements.  </s>
<s> But for IE and others we would have to describe the unit types to avoid.  </s>
<s> * Finally, we will have to answer the question about whether everything needs to be relative sizes, or just fonts.  </s>
<s> Opinion is leaning towards just fonts but there isn't a formal consensus.  </s>
<s> I would say definately fonts need to be scalable, I'm on the fence about layout regions (I would like to require them to be scalable in particular to avoid clipping if the font scales but the layout region doesn't, but I don't know how solidly I could defend that), and I'm pretty willing not to impose requirements on margins, borders, padding, etc.  </s>
<s> Chris Ridpath wrote in his mail "Absolute/relative sizes":  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> Hello everyone, Chris' post got me thinking about allowing the users to control the way the content is rendered.  </s>
<s> The biggest problem with pixels at the moment, is that Internet Explorer doesn't let you scale them using the text size setting in the view menu.  </s>
<s> This violates the UAAG [1].  </s>
<s> I hope it's a temporary problem that Microsoft will fix in the next release.  </s>
<s> I do not think we should include workarounds for this in the WCAG 2 guidelines and just say something about using relative measures, even if that includes px.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we could add another guideline to principle 1 about preserving user preferences for rendering of content?  </s>
<s> Suggested new guideline: Guideline 1.x: Allow users to control the rendering of the content Level 1 success criteria: 1.  </s>
<s> If the technology supports relative measures, specify font sizes in relative measures.  </s>
<s> 2. Make sure the content is still functional if rendering suggestions from the author are not followed.  </s>
<s> (definition?: Rendering suggestions include what fonts to use, font decorations, size specifications, colors, etc.) Level 2 succes criteria: 1. Do not change the default font size of the "main text".  </s>
<s> [I don't know the word for "main text", in Dutch it translates to "bread text"] Who benefits from guideline 1.x: * People with limited vision can change their font settings so they can read the content in the font size they prefer.  </s>
<s> * People who are blind or dyslexic can have the content read to them by assistive technology without loosing functionality.  </s>
<s> * People with color deficiency can use the web content because there none of the functionality depends on color.  </s>
<s> Example 1: A form that mentions in text which required fields are missing.  </s>
<s> When a user submits a form without filling in all the required fields, a message appears that informs the user which fields are missing.  </s>
<s> The missing fields are also indicated in color to help people with cognitive limitations recognize what fields need attention.  </s>
<s> Because the message is also available in text, people who cannot see color will still know which fields they have to correct.  </s>
<s> A by-product of the second level 1 SC is that it makes "Any information presented through color is also available without color (for example, through context or markup or coding that does not depend on color).  </s>
<s> " obsolete so we would solve that problem at the same time.  </s>
<s> The reason for the level 2 SC is this.  </s>
<s> Many people use styles like these: body { font-size: 0.8em; Effectively this is saying to the user "I'm just going to ignore your font preferences, I want you to read the text at 80% of your prefered text size".  </s>
<s> I think a success criteria against this would be a good addition to level 2. What do you think about this suggested guideline?  </s>
<s> I do not want to get into the word smithing yet, first I would like to hear from several people what they think about a guideline about allowing users to control the rendering of the content.  </s>
