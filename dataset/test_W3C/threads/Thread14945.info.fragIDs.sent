<s> Moved to xtech (cause it is glossary discussion), and because there was a discussion in the AU group this week about explicitly using normative and non-normative as they are important technical terms.  </s>
<s> Please follow this thread up on the xtech list and not on WCAG.  </s>
<s> Thread starts in WCAG at an older thread).  </s>
<s> Continues in xtech archives...  </s>
<s> The definition in the User agent guidelines seems to be a little vague.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, it could be rephrased as "the things that are included in the most concise version of the guidelines" But I don't think that is what it means.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, it means "the things that are required by the guidelines, as opposed to information that is provided to make them easier to understand.  </s>
<s> For example, the text of a checkpoint is normative, but the introduction section of the guidelines is informative, or non-normative, because it isn't part of the formal requirements of the guidelines" or something like that.  </s>
<s> I agree with Jonathan that if we are going to use thhis term (and it seems that we should) that we should provide a good clear definition based on the technical meaning normally given in standards writing.  </s>
<s> I think that where we introduce the term - for the first time in a single page version of the guidelines - we should give a very clear plain english explanation of what it means.  </s>
<s> I suggest also that the first time it appears in a single page document (e.g. there are guidelines and techniques documents that are broken into multiple web pages) we should try to find a short equivalent phrasing.  </s>
<s> For example: The techniques in this document are not normative requirements (i.e. it is not compulsory to implement them in order to claim conformance to the XXX specification), but informative, or non-normative, guidance provided by the working group.  </s>
<s> And I think that the word should be linked to the glossary wherever it appears - it is a word with a lot of different technical meanings it seems, and not a very common english word.  </s>
