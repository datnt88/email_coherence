<s> Notation3 parsing is done with Python for the moment, so TimBL defined N3 quotes as the same as Python quotes.  </s>
<s> In other words, for "//" read "#".  </s>
<s> And it saves a byte :-) Longer quotes can be done using the """ syntax.  </s>
<s> Three double quotes starts and stops a multi-lined comment.  </s>
<s> Instead of repeating the subject, if the subjects are the same, but the predicate and objects are different, you can use a semi-colon ";", so that the above becomes:- :site e:domain http://www.foo.com/ ; e:homepage http://www.foo.com/index.html .  </s>
<s> Don't forget the full stop at the end (period); I always leave it out by mistake too, and my N3 doesn't parse...  </s>
<s> Things can have multiple objects.  </s>
<s> In other words, if you have some triples where the subject *and* predicate are the same, you can use a comma ",", like so:- :site e:domain http://www.foo.com/ , http://www.example.com/ .  </s>
<s> We can probably use Wordnet for some of these terms.  </s>
<s> How about using rdf:type, or in N3 this is abbreviated to "a":- :t1 a e:tool .  </s>
<s> hmmmmmm.....  </s>
<s> I'm not sure about the use of a { context } here.  </s>
<s> I think you mean a further node, such as would be represented by brackets: [ ], but I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> :t1 e:says [ :img1 aert:altStatus aert:suspicious ] .  </s>
<s> Othewise, it's a neat syntax isn't it?  </s>
<s> Please note that there are some N3 development tools that might be of use at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ which includes an N3 to RDF processor, and a simple query engine (CWM).  </s>
<s> I think that this is a neat direction for EARL, but we need to start thinking exactly what we will require from terms in the earl namespace.  </s>
<s> Daniel wrote a list down somewhere (I'll have to look it up), and I think maybe we should start from that.  </s>

<s> Sean, Thanks for the tips on shortening the notation.  </s>
<s> As for use of the curley brackets signifying context, where I had the humans :hu1 and :hu2 asserting different things about e:altStatus (BTW, I correct a typo here... I had aerte:altStatus) :hu1 e:says {:img1 e:altStatus e:fail } .  </s>
<s> :hu2 e:says {:img1 e:altStatus e:pass } .  </s>
<s> I rechecked and i think that indeed a proper use of context.  </s>
<s> [1] says: QUOTE Sometimes, we need to talk about more than one context.  </s>
<s> For example, if either one statement or another is true, then we can't put them in the same context.  </s>
<s> In N3 a context can be represented by enclosing all the statements it encloses in curly braces { }.... x.rdf :says { :pat a :Person .  </s>
<s> } .  </s>
<s> ... This example just declares that the document x.rdf expresses the hypothetical context in which it is stated that pat is a person: the statement above doesn't state that pat is a person.  </s>
<s> END QUOTE  </s>
<s> That's what I'm trying to express... two contexts: in one context, the one :hu1 expresses, in which e:altStatus is fail, in the other, which :hu2 expresses, in which it's pass.  </s>
<s> And I'd want this even if we had just one  </s>
<s> human saying one thing.  </s>
<s> It's a statement about another statement.  </s>
<s> Ref [1] also has the following example for square brackets: QUOTE #pat #child [ #age "4" ] , [ age "3" ].  </s>
<s> You could read this as #pat has a #child which has #age of "4" and a #child which has an #age of "3".  </s>
<s> END QUOTE note that the square brackets only have predicates and objects, no subjects.  </s>
<s> So again, I think this shows that the curley bracket contexts are what's needed here.  </s>
<s> So in addition to getting a good vocabulary, we've got to thing about what the terms have as objects.  </s>
<s> Objects can be elements in a site, the site as  </s>
<s> a whole, or contexts containing statements about a site.  </s>

<s> Yes, that seems fine.  </s>
<s> I get a bit messed up with Seth Russell's semEnglish language, which he evolved from Notation3.  </s>
<s> There, you can use [] for almost anything, depending upon the amount of elements inside.  </s>
<s> For example, one element is a URI, two is (p,o), three is a triple, and so on.  </s>
<s> Very true, and that's more of the tool thing "what does this triple point to?".  </s>
<s> It may be a site, or it may be another triple, or whatever.  </s>
<s> The vocabulary is the bit that will be defined in the main language, it is the bit that is "EARL".  </s>
<s> The rest is simply RDF M&amp;S, so there are already many ways to apply it, and lots of processors.  </s>
<s> This is one of the great advanages of using RDF.  </s>
<s> It may be that people will be needing to create their own EARL-type vocabularies: e.g. one for repair tools, one for editors, and so on.  </s>
<s> I think in that way it should be a modular specification... CSS and XHTML have both benefited enourmously from modularization.  </s>
<s> It's something to consider when we develop EARL for real.  </s>
