<s> * (3) might never be executed, because an implementation might _not_ auto insert of HTML and BODY elements on a call to HTMLDocument.getElementsByTagName().  </s>

<s> Maybe these are slightly perverse examples, but I does look as tho' the spec needs a little tightening up here.  </s>

<s> This problem doesn't seem quite so confusing if you assume that a parser will do fixups (ie.  </s>
<s> adding the HTML and BODY elements) but a DOM document generated from scratch will only contain those nodes that have been explicitely inserted programmatically.  </s>
<s> So if you don't explicitely insert an HTML element your DOM tree will be missing it no matter what calls you make.  </s>
<s> This puts the onus on the programmer and makes it easier to predict what will happen.  </s>
<s> This would make creating invalid HTML DOM trees possible but I think its pretty hard (and unreasonable) for a DOM implementation to completely insure a valid HTML document no matter what a progammer does.  </s>
<s> (At least for server-side applications, anyway).  </s>
<s> I think that allowing the DOM implementation to do the fixups automatically when, say, calling getElementsByTagName() would complicate certain types of processing that depend on a priori knowledge of DOM tree mutations.  </s>

<s> The DOM Level 1 doesn't actually define how to create (or save, for that matter) a document - it's something that we're currently discussing for Level 2. So what should the Level 2 spec say on the matter?  </s>

<s> Err ... which matter?  </s>
<s> Document creation or auto-insert of HTML and BODY elements?  </s>
<s> On the latter, I think that HTMLDocument.getBody() should be defined to insert HTML and BODY elements if none currently exist, but that no other methods should do auto-insertion ... if an explict insert or append would create an invalid structure model an exception should be thrown.  </s>
<s> On the former, I can say what I'd like the Java version of a hypothetical API to look like.  </s>
<s> Something along the lines of the, by now almost cannonical, abstract factory + dynamic loading pattern that's used all over the place in Suns and others APIs, package org.w3c.dom; public interface DocumentFactory public abstract Document createDocument(); public abstract final class DocumentFactoryBuilder public static DocumentFactory getInstance() // try-catch omitted for brevity String docFactoryClassName = System.getProperty("org.w3c.dom.documentfactory"); return Class.forName(docFactoryClassName).newInstance(); package org.w3c.dom.html; public interface HTMLDocumentFactory public abstract HTMLDocument createDocument(); public abstract final class HTMLDocumentFactoryBuilder public static HTMLDocumentFactory getInstance() // try-catch omitted for brevity String docFactoryClassName = System.getProperty("org.w3c.dom.htmldocumentfactory"); return Class.forName(docFactoryClassName).newInstance();  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how this should be mapped to IDL tho' ... the abstract class with an implemented method is essential to this technique.  </s>
