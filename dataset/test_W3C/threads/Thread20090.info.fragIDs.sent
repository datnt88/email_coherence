<s> Hi, I noticed a weird behaviour with Amaya (3.1 and 4.0) and Red Hat 7 : double clicking links would not work any more.  </s>
<s> Fortunately Alt-Return works.  </s>
<s> Tweaking the double-click delay had no effect.  </s>
<s> Both versions of the software run fine on other Linux "brands" or with the previous Red Hat version (6.2).  </s>
<s> Did any one notice the same problem ?  </s>
<s> Could it have to do with their switch to XFree 4 ?  </s>
<s> We didn't experiment with that configuration.  </s>
<s> Could you investigate more for us.  </s>
<s> The function that manages Xevents is FrameCallback in Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/appli.c Nevertheless I guess you are able to follow links with simple clicks when you change the preference in Special/Preferences/General.  </s>
