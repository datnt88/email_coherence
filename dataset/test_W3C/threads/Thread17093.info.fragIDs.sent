<s> Hi, I am developing a site using XHTML and CSS that degrades gracefully to a linear format for older browsers and text readers.  </s>
<s> Users with their own stylesheets should be able to override the site colours and font sizes without any problems.  </s>
<s> The problem we have is that the client wants the content to be centred on the page with some fixed width columns - if you try to increase the font size in the browser some of the content ends up overlapping from one column to the one beside it.  </s>
<s> It only happens with the menu column down the left hand side when there are long words in the menu.  </s>
<s> I can get around this by providing a 'text only' style link on the page so that users with problems can get the linear version.  </s>
<s> Ideally I should try to persuade the client to move to more flexible columns, but I have failed so far.  </s>
<s> What would you suggest the best way to go with this is?  </s>
<s> I would appreciate your feedback.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker  </s>
<s> I would not use nor call it a text only page.  </s>
<s> I would if the client insists charge extra for the required duplication and code the page so that it works correctly and link to it with an accessible page link if need be and leave the other the way the client wants it to be.  </s>
<s> In this way, everyone gets the full functionality of the page.  </s>
