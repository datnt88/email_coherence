<s> aloha, jon!  </s>
<s> isn't a quote conventional font dialog box unquote a technique?  </s>
<s> i don't think that the proposal is any clearer; nor, upon reflection, do i think that much tweaking is necessary, provided that the 2-step cascade worked out and notated by ian in the minutes from the 19 july 2001 telecon is addressed... the current 4.2 says precisely what you restated, only in a non-techniquey manner -- what i would, then counter-propose is the following:  </s>
<s> Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font families  </s>
<s> offered by the conventional font selection mechanism of the operating environment.  </s>
<s> If the operating environment does not include a conventional/direct font dialog selection mechanism, allow the user to choose any font family supported by the conventional text drawing APIs of the operating environment.  </s>

<s> /NEW  </s>
<s> Gregory, On the call yesterday people seemed to want to use the phrase dialog box in the requirements, since that is terminology that is more familiar to developers.  </s>
<s> I add the word "resource" to emphasize the part of the operating system environment user interface a user would expect from an application for font and or color selection.  </s>
<s> The proposed wording doesn't require you to use the font dialog box resource, but only that you provide the same capabilities as found in the operating system resource.  </s>
<s> Maybe that needs to be made clearer.  </s>
<s> What do people think about "font/color dialog box resource" or "conventional font/color selection mechanism"?  </s>
