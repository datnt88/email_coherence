<s> I raised this in the catalog group, and we agreed that it was outside of our mandate and did not bother to discuss it further.  </s>
<s> Some of us felt that it was something that the ERB should add when they integrate the catalog proposal with the XML spec.  </s>
<s> Then I hope the ERB sends you all back to the drawing board.  </s>
<s> What is the catalog _for_?  </s>
<s> It is for turning a PUBLIC ID into a SYSTEM ID.  </s>
<s> That is _all_ it is for.  </s>
<s> You now have to solve the problem of finding the CATALOG in the first place, or you have not solved the required problem.  </s>
<s> I really have no problem at all with your accurate statement of the need for a resolution mechanism.  </s>
<s> But I must ask the question 'What is XML _for_?' in the same way you do, as we aren't trying to solve all the world's problems here, simply come up with a simplified subset of SGML called XML.  </s>
<s> There are a lot of thorny problems that XML may force to a  </s>

<s> I do agree that the market will solve this (hopefully soon), as the need is obviously there.  </s>
<s> And it may be an XML application that points the way.  </s>
<s> This isn't a matter of passing the buck; it's simply outside the mandate for XML.  </s>

<s> No, we're not trying to "simply come up with a simplified subset of SGML called XML".  </s>
<s> According to our activity statement: p The W3C has created an Editorial Review Board and Working Group to build a set of standards to make it easy and straightforward to use SGML on the Web: easy to define document types, easy to author and manage SGML-defined documents, and easy to transmit and share them across the Web.  </s>
<s> p The goal of the W3C SGML activity is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web.  </s>
<s> As in the case of HTML, the implementation of SGML on the Web will require attention not just to structure and content, but also to the standardization of linking and display functions.  </s>
<s> p Web servers and clients conforming to the relevant standards must be able to exchange generic SGML documents in a transparent manner.  </s>
<s> In particular: li Web servers with generic SGML content must be able prepare data for transmission.  </s>
<s> This typically includes the generation of a context wrapper with each SGML fragment together with pointers to an associated DTD and one or more stylesheets.  </s>
<s> li Clients that process generic SGML must be able to unpackage the fragment, parse it in context according to the DTD, render it (if a rendering application) in accordance with the stylesheet, and correctly interpret hypertext semantics (links, etc.) associated with various SGML elements.  </s>
<s> There's more going on here than just subsetting SGML.  </s>
<s> You have to be able to get documents across the Web and they have to be able to do what they're expected to do when they get there.  </s>
<s> It's still an open question whether this group should be trying to establish or recommend a resolution mechanism, but the question is relevant and will eventually have to be dealt with.  </s>
<s> Personally, I find that I am much more inclined to try to establish a mechanism than I was a few months ago.  </s>
