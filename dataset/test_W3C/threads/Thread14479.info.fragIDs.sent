<s> Hi, Gregory Suppose that you were appearing before a congressional sub-committee.  </s>
<s> How would you argue before them why no functionality provided on web pages should be labelled as being appropriate for blind users?  </s>
<s> Why would this be of benefit to most blind web users of various levels of computer/web sophistication?  </s>

<s> Hi Scott,  </s>
<s> I would like to encourage you to initiate discussions like this on the w3c-wai-ig list rather than the w3c-wai-gl list.  </s>
<s> I believe that the IG list is more appropriate for general discussions, while the GL list is more appropriate for concrete discussions about the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Due to the amount of mail I receive and must process, I count on exchanges on this list to be as lean as possible.  </s>
<s> I don't mean to discourage discussion, but to encourage it in the appropriate forum.  </s>
<s> If this question has a direct bearing on the WCAG, it belongs here.  </s>
<s> It was not clear to me from your questions that they had a direct bearing on the Working Group's chartered work.  </s>

<s> Scott,  </s>
<s> I think this a complex question.  </s>
<s> And it should be remembered that the primary role of this group is not to stand up and argue at congress or parliament or court, but to find the best ways to make the web accessible.  </s>
<s> I think that to label something as "appropriate for blind users" in general is to ignore the varying skill levels, operating methods, and other differing user needs within the group of people who might expect to use such features.  </s>
<s> It is more helpful, in my estimation, to describe functionalities available.  </s>
<s> In addition, this will alert people who are not blind, but who have similar needs, to the fact that they can use them.  </s>

<s> First off, from my perspective this would be a waste.  </s>
<s> The NFB and ACB can take care of talking to Congress.  </s>
<s> We can't waste technical talent like Gregory on that.  </s>
<s> We need him working at .com intensity on synthesizing the better answer for how to do it.  </s>
<s> Not dickering over what to call it.  </s>
<s> There are two basic reasons: One is that this is not very descriptive.  </s>
<s> The appropriateness of page or site functions for users depends on more things than their level of visual function.  </s>
<s> It would be better to describe what the page function actually does, so blind and sighted users alike can better discern for themselves if they want to use the function.  </s>
<s> The other is the labeling issue.  </s>
<s> For better or for worse a lot of people carry around in their hearts a negative stigma attached to blindness.  </s>
<s> Many blind people have internalized this.  </s>
<s> So if two ways to describe the functionality are equally informative, it is still better to avoid the stigmatized language.  </s>
<s> A more descriptive designation than "good for blind" would be better for blind users because they could better tell if it were really good for _them_.  </s>
<s> And it would be better for sighted users because they, too would have a better clue on which to choose to use or not use that function.  </s>
<s> And it would be better for the blind users because not so many of them would be offended by being singled out on the basis of what they may feel is an infirmity, or may feel is looked down on by others.  </s>

<s> Hi, Al  </s>
<s> I was taking a hypothetical stance.  </s>
<s> Basically, I was asking how would he explain to the world why some features/options designed for blind users should not be labelled so.  </s>
<s> Have you looked at the control panel for windows 95/98?  </s>
<s> There is an icon marked accessibility options.  </s>
<s> From my experience as a disabled person and from comments I've heard from various blind people, marking features as being appropriate makes it much easier to find the features which would be of greater interest.  </s>
<s> As one blind man told me, it can be hard for a blind person to find things.  </s>
<s> Anything which helps to simply the searching process would seem to be of benefit.  </s>
<s> (Watch blind people trying to find things on a web page.) Indicating some feature as being of interest to a blind user is more informative than not doing that and there is not equivalent.  </s>
<s> A question to ask is whether it is more important to make a process easier for a blind person by appropriate labelling or let them waste work/study time in order not to single them out.  </s>
<s> Using a dog or cane already singles them out.  </s>
<s> Maybe it's just the blind people I know, but the feedback I'm getting is that ease of use would seem to be more important.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> aloha, scott!  </s>
<s> to talk of quote stigmatization unquote and quote labelling unquote is a non sequitor... the question isn't quote what's in a name or label unquote, it is quote how can one deliver content best suited to an individual's modality and personal preferences unquote, and in my opinion, quote disability profiling unquote is definitely _not_ the answer... my opposition to your stance has nothing to do with the label blind, but with a quote one-size-fits-all unquote server-side approach to tailoring the presentation and ordering of content based on disability profiling... i don't care what others call me (most of what i'm called falls into 2 categories -- 4 or 12 letter words -- anyway), and i personally prefer to be called blind, rather than quote visually impaired unquote, a euphemism which has never made any sense to me, for (at least to my ears) it sounds as if it describes one of WCAG's main target audiences -- web designers who are so distracted by what they are looking at as they put together a site that they fail to realize that what an author sees (if he or she is capable of visual perception) is not necessarily what a user gets served up on his or her computer... i do, however, object to being served up pages based solely upon such a monolithic and inflexible classification -- to my mind, it is as indiscriminate a way to serve content to a user as most of the browser-sniffing which is performed today, which simply searches for the string quote Mozilla unquote in the user agent header/declaration... just my 2 cents, gregory.  </s>

<s> Hi, Gregory For the past five years I've worked with graduate students in understanding how to evaluate designs of new products.  </s>
<s> One of the techniques is called "scenario analysis".  </s>
<s> Basically, it's seeing whether an appproach or design will work with various characters in differing situations.  </s>
<s> I believe that part of the problem is that you have been looking at what you would like, i.e. adjusting web pages via style sheets.  </s>
<s> Look at how other blind people would respond in various web surfing situations.  </s>
<s> Given the option of selecting a button which gives a more-tailored web page or using style sheets, how many blind people, besides yourself, would prefer style sheets?  </s>
<s> How many blind people would prefer selecting a button and getting web pages which are much easier to use, even if not exactly what they want?  </s>
<s> Would these blind users be willing to accept that web pages are "good enough" match for their needs and avoid the work of fine tuning?  </s>
<s> A number of blind users are like you in that they liked the approach that I took in redesigning the web page.  </s>
<s> It may not be exactly what they would like.  </s>
<s> However, given the amount of work they would had to put in, hitting a link or a button, and the significant improvement in the web page's ease of use, my impression was that they seemed satisfied.  </s>
<s> Again, from the feedback I got, this would seem to be a success story in meeting users needs of improved ease of use with little additional effort on the user's part.  </s>
