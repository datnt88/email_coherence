<s> We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html.  </s>
<s> ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them.  </s>
<s> I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th).  </s>
<s> Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings.  </s>
<s> This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th.  </s>
<s> Monday is Martin Luther King day.  </s>
<s> What are your thoughts?  </s>
<s> Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor?  </s>
<s> I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your input.  </s>

<s> I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ??? MLK Day is never better than in Savannah!  </s>
<s> maybe we could go there?  </s>
<s> I personally don't want to spend my life in Orlando, thank you!  </s>
<s> I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home.  </s>
<s> I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints.  </s>

<s> Any time or venue should be fine with me.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Tim Boland NIST  </s>
<s> For 2004, when u prefer (best in may-july) we can host in Venice the F2F.  </s>
<s> Matt May and Charles can confirm the good place for conference and holiday :) Roberto Scano IWA/HWG EMEA Coordinator W3C Advisory Commitee Representative for IWA/HWG International Webmasters Association / HTML Writers Guild E-Mail: emea@iwanet.org - w3c-rep@iwanet.org  </s>
<s> I have never had a holiday in Venice, although I would like to.  </s>
<s> But I can confirm that it is a nice place to have a meeting, and could probably attend (it is not that hard to get to from Europe).  </s>

<s> Voglio andare a venezia!  </s>
<s> oops - one should not show such enthusiasm, I suspect!  </s>
<s> Could we be careful to make the dates so that those of us who do come a long way can make it, please!  </s>
<s> Liddy  </s>
<s> If we can plan, what about planning the year, Australia included?  </s>
<s> best time for us is anytime - maybe northern winter from others' perspectives?  </s>
<s> Liddy  </s>
<s> Planning meetings a year in advance (at least tentatively) is a good idea.  </s>
<s> I will add this to the agenda for the next call.  </s>
