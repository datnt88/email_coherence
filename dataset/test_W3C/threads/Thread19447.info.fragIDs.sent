<s> A few days after installation amaya decided to ignore my double-clicks altogether i.e. it simply does not follow hyperlinks anymore.  </s>
<s> Does someone have the same problem and better yet the solution?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> BTW does anyone know of a 100% (or so) error free fully HTML (any W3C spec.) compliant browser?  </s>
<s> Of the browsers installed around here:  </s>
<s> - KFM (KDE File Manager, HTML widget) - Netscape 4 - Amaya no one is.  </s>
<s> Frankly I am starting to loose faith in the prospect of a quality, seriously interoperable, WWW! How dificult can it be to write a decent browser, at least for Linux?  </s>
<s> I am convinced that Amaya could be this (a 100% error free HTML 4 compliant browser) _if and only if_ the Amaya team would focus on the browser itself.  </s>
<s> A WYSIWYG HTML editor simply does not make any sense!  </s>
<s> HTML is a _language_!  </s>
<s> I bet 99.999999% of HTML authors prefer to write HTML by hand.  </s>
<s> (I also suspect that many Amaya bugs are actualy in---or caused by---the Thot system.  </s>
<s> If this is true, and then since (as I understand) Thot development has stopped, then if Amaya would focus on browsing it would be less costly to migrate to a more stable system.)  </s>
<s> It is very clear to me that the requisites of a quality WWW in the near future include the existence of browsers fully compliant with HTML 4, CSS2, XML (in that order).  </s>
<s> (I am aware there some questions here should be taken to the general W3 forum and so they will in due course.)  </s>

<s> Could you analyze what has changed when amaya decided to ignore double-clicks?  </s>
<s> It should be a great help to understand what is the problem.  </s>
<s> I don't agree with you Mario.  </s>
<s> 80% of HTML authors use authoring tools (like FrontPage, Home Page, Page Mill, Netscape-Composer, etc.).  </s>
<s> HLML 4, MathML and then XML are not so easy to write by hand!  </s>
<s> True, but that needs a lot of work in current browsers.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> You know, I'm not in love with the amaya team.  </s>
<s> They don't answer  </s>
<s> my questions, ignore or flame my remarks, and produce more bugs than line of codes (well, that last one is not true!  </s>
<s> - put as many smiley here as you wish:).  </s>
<s> In fact I'm even ashamed some of them are from the well renown french INRIA.  </s>
<s> :(  </s>
<s> Anyway, amaya is more a tool to test the standard than a declared browser or even wysiwyg editor.  </s>
<s> As such, bugs should be forgiven.  </s>
<s> I would defend them against unjustified attacks.  </s>
<s> And this one is not justified at all.  </s>
<s> More : please be sure that the easyer the tool, the happier the user.  </s>
<s> Web creators don't need to be programmers.  </s>
<s> They shall be graphists, artists, publicists, journalists, whatever, but the ruling of our race (programmers) on the web is to be done.  </s>
<s> Thus a WYSIWIG html generator is needed, asked for and used when available.  </s>
<s> Even programmers like I am (those who focus on the result and not on the way) use perl and emacs only because they have no better editor handy to generate good and errorfree HTML.  </s>
<s> I support the amaya team to develop and give as a free tool something that otherwise is unheard of.  </s>

<s> Hello, We may forget to answer some questions but we take into account all remarks, suggestions and bug reports sent to the mailing list.  </s>
<s> You say that you are ashamed that some of us are from INRIA.  </s>
<s> Let me tell you that we are only two people (both from INRIA) fully involved in the project.  </s>
<s> We have to correct bugs, develop new features and W3C recommandations, and answer questions.  </s>
<s> Do you think that this is an easy task.  </s>
