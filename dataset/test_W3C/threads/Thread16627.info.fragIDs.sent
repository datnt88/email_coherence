<s> While developing a Web-based virtual tour for an art museum, I have had no difficulty identifying most of the changes in language that occur within a site of this nature.  </s>

<s> I've been referring to a list of ISO language codes located at: It does not include certain languages such as Bamileke (Cameroon), Baule (Ivory Coast) and Hemba (Democratic Republic of the Congo).  </s>

<s> Is there a better source for language codes that might include these languages?  </s>
<s> 2. If I am unable to find official language codes, what are my options, besides ignoring this Priority 1 checkpoint?  </s>

<s> :) The main arguments _for_ using server side maps are: 1. Funky shapes and other custom coding (you can actually get pretty detailed if you want to for reason, but in most cases you won't want to) 2. Backwards compatibility -- at one time, only "new" browsers supported server side maps, but that time was about 4 years ago The main arguments _against_ using server side maps and _for_ using client side server maps: 1.  </s>
<s> No way of encoding accessibility information via alt in server-side 2. Faster processing because it doesn't have to make a server roundtrip with client-side 3. Client-side can be used in offline browsing situations just fine, because doesn't need access to server 4. A lot easier to make and maintain client-side maps, from the webmaster's perspective 5. Client-side works great in all current browsers including Lynx 6. Server-side maps require additional, redundant textual links which are not required for client-side maps (but they are still a good idea) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> Hi Jim, You have a reasonable point, there is no reason to use a serverside imagemap in the King County example you cite.  </s>
<s> Serverside imageamaps are used for one of two reasons:  </s>
<s> 1. Historical - serverside images were common before browsers supporeted imagemaps.  </s>
<s> This has not been the case for quite a while.  </s>
<s> 2. Dynamic content - when the resulting link is based on "computations", it needs to be server based.  </s>
<s> The common example of this is linkshare programs Hope this helps.  </s>
