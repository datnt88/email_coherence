<s> Hello, Per my action item assigned at the 15 February 2001 teleconference [1] about issue 443 [2], please consider this proposal for which device-dependent repair requirements should appear in UAAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.1 of the 26 January 2001 Guidelines [3] states: "Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully through keyboard input alone, pointing device input alone, and voice input alone.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]" I propose splitting this checkpoint in three (rough wording here): Checkpoint A: "Ensure that the user can operate the user agent's native functionalities through keyboard input alone, pointing device input alone, and voice input alone.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]" Checkpoint B: "Ensure that the user can operate device-independent functionalities specified in content through keyboard input alone, pointing device input alone, and voice input alone.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]" Checkpoint C: "Allow configuration so that the user can operate device-dependent functionalities specified in content through other devices (e.g., simulate pointing device specific behavior through the keyboard).  </s>
<s> In this configuration, alert the user when an active element has device-specific behaviors associated.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3]" I think that checkpoint C should be Priority 3 because it is likely to provide incomplete repair.  </s>
<s> Thus, it clearly does not qualify for P1 by definition: "This checkpoint must be satisfied by user agents, otherwise one or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to access the Web."  </s>
<s> There is no guarantee that if satisfied, checkpoint C will make access possible.  </s>
<s> [I would also note that our priority statements don't say anything about the responsibilities of other parties.  </s>
<s> This is clearly an authoring issue first.]  </s>
<s> Consider these scenarios: 1) The author has created content that is device independent.  </s>
<s> In this case, checkpoint B applies.  </s>
<s> 2) The author has created content that is device-dependent, but has also provided alternative content (per WCAG 1.0 checkpoints 9.2 and 11.4).  </s>
<s> In this case, emulation is not required since the author has ensured access.  </s>
<s> 3) The author has created content that is device-dependent, and has not provided an alternative.  </s>
<s> The device-dependent content is either: a) Content that doesn't really depend on a particular device but has just been encoded that way, or b) Content that really does depend on a particular device (e.g., a user interface where the user scratches the "silver paint" on an electronic lottery ticket to reveal a hidden number).  </s>
<s> The user agent can't recognize the difference in general, since handlers are built with scripts.  </s>
<s> So that means that, in general, the user agent is not likely to repair any better content of type (3a) over content of type (3b).  </s>
<s> Repair in case (3a) is probably useful to some users, can be carried out automatically, and is technically feasible (e.g., the UA could throw an "onmouseover" event whenever an "onfocus" event occurs, or implement a "zap-mouse-to-focus" functionality).  </s>
<s> However, in case (3b), emulation is not likely to help some users.  </s>
<s> Even a tool such as MouseKeys will not help some users (e.g., users who are blind) interact with the user interface.  </s>
<s> If the author has designed content that expressly takes advantage of the nature of two-dimensional visual space, there's not much users who are blind can do with certainty.  </s>
<s> Worse, emulating mouse events might cause unexpected behavior to occur, thus disorienting the user.  </s>
<s> And, emulation of certain pointing device events is less obvious (e.g., how do you translate "onmousemove" to the keyboard?),  </s>
<s> so repair by the UA would likely be incomplete on this axis as well.  </s>
<s> In our current definition of "active element", we don't expect the user agent to recognize (and thus repair) the class of author-specified behaviors that are encoded through "event bubbling" techniques.  </s>
<s> Finally, the user agent should not be required to emulate mouse-specific behaviors that are not controlled by the user agent (e.g., the case of server-side image maps).  </s>
<s> CONCLUSION - Emulation of author-supplied device-specific behaviors seems to be useful for some cases, and not helpful (or even disorienting) in others.  </s>
<s> - The user agent is not expected to recognize the useful cases from the non-useful cases since behaviors are encoded through scripts today.  </s>
<s> This means that the user agent couldn't "warn" the user, for example.  </s>
<s> - Repair functionalities are likely to be incomplete and not guarantee access, so I think that they should be Priority 3.  </s>

<s> No. It is not about guaranteeing access, it is about providing a way to alleviate a problem, which (at P1 level) is otherwise guaranteed to prevent access.  </s>

<s> My comment about our priority definitions not referring to the responsibilities of authors is an important one.  </s>
<s> The user agent cannot remove all access barriers alone; the author must contribute.  </s>
<s> The definition of P1 is: "This checkpoint must be satisfied by user agents, otherwise one or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to access the Web.  </s>
<s> Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic  </s>
<s> requirement for enabling some people to access the Web." Substituting: "The user agent must emulate all mouse behavior through the keyboard, otherwise one or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to access the Web."  </s>
<s> I don't agree with the substitution since the "otherwise" doesn't work for me; even if the UA emulates/repairs, one or more  </s>
<s> groups of users will still find it impossible to access the Web (as described below).  </s>
<s> The author's contribution is crucial here, and that's not captured in our priority statement.  </s>

<s> I think new Checkpoint C Ian has proposed as a general repair checkpoint for pointer device dependent event handlers is a good addition to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint C probably rates a Priority 3 given the scope of repair that could potentially be done and our current lack implementation experience for the range of things that could be done and the knowledge on how different techniques improve access to content by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> But the group has decided to include in UAAG specific pointing based events to be simulated/activated through the keyboard as a priority 1 requirement.  </s>
<s> So I propose the following additional checkpoint at the Priority 1 level: Checkpoint D: Provide keyboard activation of the following pointer based scripting events for elements with explicit event handlers: onClick, onDblClick, onMouseOver, onMouseOut, onMouseUp and onMouseDown [Priority 1].  </s>
<s> Note: The event object generated for these events need to include pointer coordinates that are either inside or outside the element box (defined by CSS?) associated with the event depending on the intrinsic event type (coordinates inside the element box, accept for onMouseOut) and the specification of a right, left, middle or combination pointer button press.  </s>
<s> The user agent is not required to generate a user specified set of pointer coordinates associated with onMouseUp and onMouseDown, or support user agent simulated pointer movement associated with onMouseMove (though it should still be compatible with built-in accessibility features like mousekeys).  </s>
<s> This checkpoint is an important special case of the new Checkpoint C proposed by Ian.  </s>
<s> Questions: 1. Do we want to include onMouseUp and onMouseDown?  </s>
<s> Leaving them out reduces the requirement for specifying left, right, middle or combination pointer button presses.  </s>
<s> 2. Is this a sufficient enough requirement or do we need more or less?  </s>

<s> Ian and Jon, If I understand this correctly, checkpoint A would apply to chrome, checkpoint B would apply to content that can be accessed in a device-independent manner, and C applies to those things that are device dependent.  </s>
<s> This would imply, I think, that the only things that the user agent must do is provide sufficient functionality to provide mouse, keyboard, and voice control of those things that are device independent, but would make priority 3 support for any code that is not specifically written as device independent.  </s>
<s> It would not require an effort, on the part of the agent, to emulate the mouse via the keyboard or voice, or any other such interface.  </s>
<s> This seems to me to be leaving too much to the author.  </s>
<s> When Joe Highschool designs a page, he has a relatively simple concept of how a person would interact with the page.  </s>
<s> He thinks that you would use the mouse to scratch the silver paint off of the lotto ticket.  </s>
<s> Since he has never thought about disability issues, why would he think about device independent controls?  </s>
<s> Under this scenario, there is no need for the user agent to emulate the mouse via other input methods, and the page is inaccessible.  </s>
<s> As it happens, there are examples of interface emulation in existence between these three modalities.  </s>
<s> You can use MouseKeys to move the mouse via the keyboard.  </s>
<s> You can use an on-screen keyboard to type with a mouse.  </s>
<s> And you can use voice input to generate character streams and to move the mouse.  </s>
<s> None of these is perfect emulation, but they do allow placing a mouse in a location, clicking, double-clicking, or generating characters without any use of the "native" device.  </s>
<s> I could, theoretically, use the keyboard to move the mouse back and forth over the lotto ticket to scratch off the silver paint.  </s>
<s> (Although if I were blind, I wouldn't know where to move the mouse.  </s>
<s> But accessibility includes other disabilties than vision.)  </s>
<s> I'm afraid that this new wording would allow an agent to ignore interface emulation support, which would not provide access to the content of many pages.  </s>

<s> Ian, No single checkpoint will assure that all groups will have access to the web.  </s>
<s> In any P1 checkpoint, some group that would have been limited will now have access.  </s>
<s> Providing mouse emulation through the keyboard will allow access to those individuals who are using character generating interface devices, but who do not have native mouse movement capability.  </s>
<s> Someone using Morse Code, for example, can't move the mouse directly.  </s>
<s> But with a "keyboard interface" can move the mouse on the screen.  </s>
<s> This person represents a group who gains access via this P1 requirement, but other groups will not be helped by this single chekcpoint.  </s>
