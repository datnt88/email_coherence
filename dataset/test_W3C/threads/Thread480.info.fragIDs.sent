<s> Hi - and many thanks for an excellent utility: never realised how bad my HTML was (and is - lots of changes I still need to make!)  </s>
<s> A wee bug in the Mac BBEdit plug-in - the following error is reported when an ampersand is part of an URL: Warning: unescaped &amp; or unknown entity "&amp;title" To put it in context, the line concerned (variations of which are used extensively in my sites) is:  </s>
<s> Is it possible to make Tidy recognise that the "&amp;" is actually part of an URL rather than an entity and is therefore acceptable?  </s>

<s> Hey, I agree; Tidy showed me where I didn't think I had errors.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have an idea of how to do this properly?  </s>
<s> : This happens on a number of Apache-generated pages, as well as a ton of hand-made ages I've seen.  </s>
<s> ..and how can we really promote proper pages?  </s>

<s> No. Try in early Navigator versions, you will get a section sign in place of the '&amp;sect' as you should.  </s>
<s> You must encode ampersands that are not meant to be entity or character references as &amp;amp;, Tidy does this for you and I am not aware of any browser (expect early Amaya versions) that doesn't deal with it properly.  </s>
