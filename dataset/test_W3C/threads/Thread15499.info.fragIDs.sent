<s> I guess I am trying to avoid hierarchy and therefore sub-groups.  </s>
<s> I want hierarchy, but the current proposal fails to address many of the issues with hierarchy.  </s>
<s> I also disagree with the suggested rendering as it only addresses single select lists (unless I missed something).  </s>
<s> I still do not know how to handle multi-select hierarchical lists, or lists with an undefined size.  </s>
<s> I mentioned the following in a mail that was not CC:ed to the WAI group:  </s>
<s> Instead of recommending syntax changes to listboxes, why not add text to HTML 4.0 with guidelines on how to properly use lists to make them more accessible.  </s>
<s> This recommendation can also apply to radio button groups and check box groups (they are no different than a list box in providing a list of options to the user).  </s>

<s> Then why does this proposal define a rendering semantic that looks very hierarchical to me?  </s>
<s> Because that is the solution that most appealed to the folks in the WAI HC WG that proposed it, I suppose.  </s>
<s> A point I'd like to make.  </s>
<s> I tried to be careful in my wording to use 'may' or 'might' and not 'will' or 'should'.  </s>
<s> The examples given are just examples of possibilities.  </s>
<s> Without them we found people had a harder time understanding the grouping being done.  </s>
<s> There are a variety of ways the grouping could be handled - from ignoring it and displaying as always, to inserting non-selectable elements as labels, to doing a true tabbed index or expanding list.  </s>
<s> We've tried to avoid telling UAs how to render it.  </s>
<s> But we want to provide structure so that UAs that DO want to do something special have a standard, valid means to do so.  </s>
<s> If there needs to be a very simple grouping mechanism, support a GROUP attribute (or something similar) on each OPTION and not use a structural construct  </s>

<s> This seems to be a slightly simplified version of the AXIS/AXES proposal.  </s>
<s> Eliminating the OPTGROUP element.  </s>
<s> It is actually something I'd though of along the way.  </s>
<s> But I think all of the objections to AXIS/AXES, which eventually caused us to withdraw that proposal and go with a container element, would still hold.  </s>
<s> It isn't as clear to users what is being grouped.  </s>
<s> With a container it is obvious how things are grouped.  </s>
<s> And what about subgroups?  </s>
<s> How would you run multiple Group elements?  </s>
<s> This appears to provide only one level of organization.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, all the rendering information in the HTML spec is hints/suggestions; i.e. SHOULD, not MUST.  </s>
<s> (I need to verify that, but that's my understanding.)  </s>
<s> That is my understanding also.  </s>
<s> And I have tried to word things carefully.  </s>
<s> So I expect that any solution to the long options list problem will carry a "suggested rendering" but no absolute requirements on user agents other than treating the new syntax as conforming HTML, i.e. not barfing.  </s>

<s> After all of the discussion relating to this topic which has taken place during the last few days, the objection to the WAI proposal still seems completely unsubstantiated.  </s>
<s> Referring to unspecified complications with regard to hierarchies and claiming that the WAI proposals are inadequate hardly amounts to an argument.  </s>
<s> So far, no positive reasons have been advanced which would support a change in the WAI working group's recommendation with respect to this issue.  </s>
<s> I believe you are referring to rendering issues only.  </s>
<s> Can you confirm this?  </s>
<s> I would very much appreciate any evidence as to how the proposal is inadequate on grounds unrelated to rendering.  </s>
<s> I don't feel its appropriate for the HTML spec to make detailed proposals for rendering.  </s>
<s> The example in the latest draft was only intended to show the hierarchy and not intended as a suggested rendering.  </s>
<s> In any case the HTML working group resolved not to add new rendering attributes.  </s>
<s> There are many ways to present multiple selection hierarchies, for instance with a hierarchical menu where the currently selected choices are indicated by check marks, or by a tree-view control that allows levels of detail to be expanded and collapsed.  </s>
<s> If we want to give authors control over this I suggest we start discussing extensions to CSS.  </s>
<s> I will do my best to make the spec clearer on the accessibility issues arising from long lists.  </s>

<s> Offhand, I am concerned it potentially won't scale and it doesn't handle the following: 1) nested value lists (my example from much earlier) 2) multi-columns 3) rich HTML items 4) mult-select for hierarchy 5) Individually checked items similar to a menu 6) Disabling of items or nested groups Scott  </s>

<s> I shall let those with greater expertise in the design of visual user interfaces deal with the detail of this objection, but a few points should be noted.  </s>
<s> Firstly, the WAI proposal defines a means of establishing a hierarchical structure of option groups, as is required for purposes of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Since it is entirely compatible with existing HTML documents and user agents, as Dave Raggett has repeatedly pointed out, it is not necessary for visual browsers to implement this feature, though it would be preferable that they do so.  </s>
<s> No evidence has been offered which suggests that the current proposal would not be amenable to extension in the future, in such a way as to meet the concerns described above.  </s>
<s> By contrast, the objector's alternative proposal does not provide the basis for future extensions and, nor does it meet the WAI accessibility requirements.  </s>
<s> Basically, I think the objection arises from a lack of appreciation of the distinction between structure and presentation, which is a fundamental feature of HTML.  </s>
