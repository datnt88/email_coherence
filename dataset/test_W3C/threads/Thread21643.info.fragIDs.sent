<s> Have you seen the section in part 2 [1] that talks about how parameters that are used to identify resources should be part of the URI?  </s>
<s> This is entirely independent of the request method used (in HTTP-speak), just saying that parameters that in some sense identify a resource should when possible be part of the URI.  </s>
<s> This has nothing to do with GET or URI encoding schemes or any other issue under recent discussion.  </s>
<s> It is just a restatement of a standard Web architecture principle in a SOAP context.  </s>
<s> "An important principle of Web architecture is that all important resources be identifiable by URI."  </s>
<s> Does this address your concern?  </s>

<s> Okay, I agree with that section and agree that it is highly related to  </s>
<s> my issue.  </s>
<s> There is one important part I do not understand.  </s>
<s> Why is this "best practice" under the title "RPC" in both the SOAP primer and the SOAP Part 2? If you were using a pure document-style of interaction would not the same best practice apply?  </s>
<s> I believe that SOAP's definition of RPC is: "the exchange of messages that map conveniently to definitions and invocations of method and procedure calls in commonly used programming languages".  </s>
<s> If so, why would proper use of URIs on the Web and in HTTP be tied to RPC?  </s>
<s> As you know, many of us see disciplined HTTP usage as an *alternative* to RPC!  </s>
<s> Until I hear back, I consider this a bug, but my level of stridency on the issue will depend upon the cost of fixing it.  </s>
<s> The primer, especially, seems quite easy to fix (at least technically, I don't know about procedurally).  </s>
<s> Merely replace the word "RPC" with "message" or "message exchanges" (or some more appropriate word of your choice).  </s>
<s> "Conveying web-friendly message exchanges" and "There are many instances where message exchanges are designed for uses which..." If something like that were done I would not push for any changes to the normative specification.  </s>
<s> Also, the primer section is a little bit confusingly written in that it seems as if 3.1.3 is entirely about "pure information retrieval" applications until you get close to the end.  </s>
<s> If it is still possible to do some re-arrangement that does not change the meaning then I would be glad to propose alternate text.  </s>

<s> Because a major difference between RPC and the Web is that RPC doesn't provide the concept of identifying resources with URIs which is why the section starts: "The World Wide Web identifies resources with URIs, but common programming conventions convey identification information in the arguments to procedures, or in the names of those procedures."  </s>
<s> That is, in plain old HTTP, it is the common mode of operation to identify resources using URIs.  </s>
<s> Yeah, I have heard about the goals of HTTP ;)  </s>
<s> From a spec point of view, I actually think this does address the issue.  </s>
<s> If you believe there are editorial improvements to the primer then I  </s>
<s> suggest you generate a new issue as this is somewhat different from this  </s>
<s> issue.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Henrik  </s>
<s> Perhaps, but not in common SOAP+HTTP usage.  </s>
<s> Some toolkits do not even make this feasible.  </s>
