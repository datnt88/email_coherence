<s> I think Sean's shrill approach is abrasive to many but he's concerned - and if not rightly so, then nothing's lost by abiding the cautions he raises.  </s>
<s> If he (and others of us) is right then maybe if he's to tone down his "alarums" we might tone down the sarcasm about "saint Tim", etc.  </s>
<s> We are all in this together.  </s>
<s> My thanks to Mr. Loughborough to pointing that out.  </s>
<s> Yes my tone is grating and annoying sometimes, but that is purely unintentional.  </s>

<s> I realise that we are all working towards a common goal:- "To promote usability &amp; accessibility on the WWW".  </s>
<s> And I suppose if the underlying tone of my messages was to use "competition" rather than "cooperation" to achieve these goals, then that was incorrect.  </s>
<s> However, I do believe in standing for what one believes in, and persuing goals to the end (but I'm not going to do that if it menas annoying people and losing friends for no reason whatsoever along the way).  </s>
<s> We have *all* been sarcastic/annoting/insulting at some point or another:- Sean: "If you're not able to create styles independant of markup, I suggest that is because you have spent too long following anachronous, limited, and blatantly illegal Web programming habits" (unintentional sarcasm) Anne: "Nice to know I'm not quite so unknowledgable as Sean makes me out to be!"
