<s> Unless anyone has a strong objection, I plan to drop support for Ant 1.4 and attempt to replace the calls to sed (and maybe patch) with built-in tasks in Ant 1.5.  </s>
<s> Ant 1.5 was released in July.  </s>
<s> Fine with me.  </s>
<s> I suppose we won't be able to be backward compatible with the first release though, since the buildfile will change?  </s>
<s> Let's indicate this properly in the attached documentation and I'll update the online documentation accordingly once we decide to go for it.  </s>
<s> So, should the setup to use be Ant 1.5 Xerces 2.1.0 Xalan 2.4.0 ?  </s>
<s> Does this work on everyone's machines?  </s>
<s> I think I'm still encountering problems with Xalan.  </s>
<s> There is a null pointer bug that I've been remiss for not submitting.  </s>
<s> I've been using Saxon 6.5.2.  </s>
<s> Sigh.  </s>
<s> I keep meaning to run the DOM TS through Xalan, but I haven't had the cycles.  </s>
<s> PLEASE submit specific Bugzilla reports for any problems that you find -- that's the best way to make sure they get properly prioritized and addressed (and to keep them from falling through the cracks).  </s>
