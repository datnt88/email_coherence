<s> MN: I really wish there was some way, or some term, that would pull in more than "just" Assistive Technology User Agent(s) as part of Category 2. Obviously, other software developers can do as they wish, but I can't tell you how many times we've come across a great piece of software, commercial and/or shareware, that if it did this "one other little thing", that the developer probably would have done had they "understood the need", it would be the solution for an individual's access problem.  </s>
<s> It just seems to me, that our "Categry 2" label, is just one more chance for us to educate, and get more developer's to "understand the needs", but if we title it "Assistive Technology User Agent", we only send the message to those already in the church.  </s>
<s> The dificulty is that if I do speech, keyboard, mouse, and graphics, is it OK to do speech and keyboard in an accessible way, but not graphics and mouse, and furthermore not to provide any way for an assistive technology to be used to improve the accessibility of the graphics and mouse bit that I do.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that without device independence (and we allow a fair amount of this to be achieved through APIs rather than natively in the current draft) and exporting information to assitive technologies there is the possibility for produing a good tool for a particular market group.  </s>
<s> Consider for a moment the EIAD browser, which is designed for people with brain injuries or cognitive disabilities (as I understand it).  </s>
<s> This relies on a touch screen interface.  </s>
<s> However a number of people with acquired brain injuries also suffer sever mobility impairments, and may need an assistive technology to use the interface (perhaps a foot-driven mouse, or a head switch), and therefore the tool.  </s>
<s> If this is not possible then is the tool accessible, or just a useful tool for a particular market niche?  </s>
<s> In the same way, a tool which is designed for the group of web users who are interested in a largely graphic, primarily point and click interface with the use of the keyboard for some advance functions may or may not export interfaces.  </s>
<s> While Internet explorer matches that definition, it is a rough attempt at summarising the needs of a large number of deaf users, as well as perhaps a small majority of web users in general.  </s>
<s> I think there is a big problem with saying that a brwser which meets the needs of 80% of the people, incluing a significant disability community, does not conform, while one which meets the needs of 8% of the people including a significant disability community does, unless we define conformance in terms of specific sets of needs - blindness, low vision, hard of hearing, mobility impairment plus blindness, hard of hearing, low vision and cognitive impairment, ... The difficulty with that approach is the sheer number of individual needs sets that must be catered for.  </s>
<s> The impact matrix is a tool that could be used to make those various subsets clear, but defining overall conformance on the basis of conformance to a subset means that there is no reason why a "desktop graphical user agent" can't simply count up the number of subsets it matches and say "we conform to more subsets than anyone else, and therefore we have done more than is required..."
