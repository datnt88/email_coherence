<s> On document length... To the extent that we have spen the time producing useful content, I think it would be a shame to cut it out just to keep documents short.  </s>
<s> Perhaps better is to structure the documents so that there is a good exec summary, and for those that wish to dig deeper, extra details may be provided.  </s>
<s> Much easier in a Web document, but possible for flat documents too, with extra work.  </s>
<s> There could two or even three levels of depth for those who really want the gory details.  </s>
<s> Much more work to produce - a question of balance and priorities and what authors feel inspired to do.  </s>

<s> As promised, you can find the second draft of the "classes as values" note at Thanks a million to everyone for all the thoughtful feedback (and for kind words along the way).  </s>
<s> I think the discussion is not over yet, I tried to address some of the points that seemed less controversial and left some of the discussions (cf my replied to Alan [1] and Aldo [2] up in the air for the moment).  </s>
<s> Nice work, Natasha!  </s>
<s> Outstanding discussion and other issues: Alan and Aldo suggested another approach which uses prototypes as values ([3], [4]).  </s>
<s> I think with this more narrow scope of the example (subjects of books rather than pictures), their solutions seem to address a somewhat different problem.  </s>
<s> But I am not sure if we have reached closure on that.  </s>
<s> Yes, my solution was using only one of the intended meanings of "subject", which I erroneously assumed as the one all the discussion started from.  </s>
<s> On the contrary, the issue was raised about another intended meaning (see below).  </s>
<s> This misunderstanding partly illustrates my point btw.  </s>
<s> Also has also brought up the issue of ontological patterns vs pragmatic patterns [4].  </s>
<s> I am not sure yet though is this is a use case to distinguish them explicitly here.  </s>
<s> I agree with Mike on terminology: I did not want to make any "purist" claim, and in fact I defended common sense and intuition against purely syntactic considerations.  </s>
<s> Maybe my choice of opposing ontological vs. pragmatic is not politically fit, since it can lead to "purist" claims.  </s>
<s> Then let's change it, let's say "meaning preserving" (or "monosemous"?) patterns vs. "polysemous" patterns.  </s>
<s> Any other easy-to-grasp terminology would be ok.  </s>
<s> I share Natasha's point on people that do not want to read 20-page specifications, and it is consistent with my defense of intuition.  </s>
<s> In fact, "I want to use this hierarchy of musical genre to annotate a music collection" refers to genre as a kind of "style", which is still different from "subject" in Natasha's (and possibly from "subject" in Dublin Core or topic maps), which is still different from "subject" in WordNet sense.  </s>
<s> I try to recap on those notions from my (hopely ground) viewpoint: 1) Natasha's "subject" (- sense 2 and 6 of WordNet 2.0) means more or less a "topic" of some book, picture, conversation, etc.  </s>
<s> Maybe Dublic and topic maps have a similar intended meaning.  </s>
<s> Chris Welty has written interesting things on that.  </s>
<s> 2) My (and Alan's?) understanding of "subject" (- sense 1 of WordNet 2.0) means more or less something chosen for representation, which seems "prototypical" in the Lion example 3) A musical genre seems closer to a kind of style, which can even be described as prototypical, but a genre is not a topic per se (although it can be the topic of some book), and a genre is not something chosen for representation.  </s>
<s> In this case, three different meaning preserving patterns should be used.  </s>
<s> The last version of Natasha's summary seems to be one of them, usable for notion (1).  </s>
<s> My Lion solution interpreted "subject" in sense (2), but my main point was that such discussions should point to the core "intended meaning" rather than to syntactic shortcuts.  </s>
<s> I think most users should be able to find their way in a list of patterns that easily exemplify the notion they are about, e.g.: "are you trying to represent the topic of some book, picture, etc.?" or "are you trying to represent the specific subject depicted or reproduced in some picture, drawing, etc.'", or "are you trying to represent a style or genre of some picture, book, tune, etc.?".  </s>
<s> These are, IMO, the "generic use cases" that domain-independent ontologies are very smart to deal with (I have a presentation and a forthcoming paper on ontology design patterns and foundational ontologies).  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, there is something all these notions have in common: they are used as "referents" of intellectual/information objects like music, pictures, books, etc.  </s>
<s> Hence, we might be interested in creating a polysemous pattern for those notions.  </s>
<s> Finally, we might even discover a common way of conceptualizing them, and in this case the pattern would be general enough to be called "meaning preserving".  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot to everyone who has contributed to the discussion!  </s>
<s> And, as I pointed out earlier, I don't think we've reached closure on some of the issues, so, probably, there will be one more iteration.  </s>
<s> Sorry for opening a possible new one, but probably your last summary is not touched by this message.  </s>
