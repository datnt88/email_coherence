<s> Libby - Looks pretty good.  </s>
<s> Some assorted minor quibblage: * (probably) most people in the EC will know what "EC" stands for, but others quite likely won't * "Where are other SW developers located?" - might want an "in Europe" in there somewhere, to acknowledge that there are Other Places in the world (qv the map discussion) * is open source really Open Source?  </s>
<s> :-).  </s>
<s> Similarly, you use both Semantic Web and semantic web - would be better to be consistent.  </s>
<s> I don't have a strong preference.  </s>
<s> * "bridging the gap between semantic web technology and the XML tool stack " my suggestion: "bridging the gaps between semantic web tools and XML tools" or even "applying standard XML tools to semantic web problems" * "... storing and search semantic web data" - s/search/searching/ * "case studies and demonstration applications" - add comma after applications * "holding developer workshops " - delete 'holding' ... a workshop is an activity, I assert :-) * I'd reorder the second major sentence to emphasise the outcome rather than the process, something like: Our goal is to refine and field-test Semantic Web standards, through open source tool development, community building, outreach and evangelism, and advanced R&amp;D.  </s>
<s> Hope this is not too late.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Ian  </s>
<s> me also  </s>
<s> i like these (technically W3C standards are 'recommendations' but i think 'standards' is clearer for the non-W3C-er) --sb  </s>
