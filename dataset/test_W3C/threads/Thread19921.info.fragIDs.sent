<s> You can download the amaya RPM from here: then install it (as root) with 'rpm -ivh amaya-2.4-1.i386.rpm'.  </s>
<s> You will need to create a KDE launcher manually, though.  </s>
<s> Your KDE help files will show you how to do this, I believe.  </s>

<s> Okay, thanks.  </s>
<s> And how stable is it?  </s>
<s> The Windows version, last I checked, crashes quite often... is that because of Amaya's notorious tangles of void pointers and blind pointer dereferencing, or because of buggy Windows APIs and system libraries, or a combination of both?  </s>
