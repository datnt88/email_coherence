<s> Thank you!  </s>
<s> I think I'll be able to move back from from 7.2 to use this version; initial report for Amaya 8.1 follows.  </s>
<s> Item 5 is now supported in Windows only?  </s>
<s> (Is support for Linux forthcoming?) Item 11 is a new variant of item 10 which has largely been addressed.  </s>
<s> PENDING in 8.1  </s>
<s> 4. Wish: bounce (increase/decrease) the nesting level of nested lists easily.  </s>
<s> 5. Wish: A shortcut key for skipping/replacing+next in the spell checker so I don't have to rely upon the mouse and compex navigation to quickly move through the document.  </s>
<s> Also, using ESC to dismiss pop-up dialogs 8. Wish: Can it open a new window in parallel?  </s>
<s> If the other window is slow to load it holds up all of my windows.  </s>
<s> 11.  </s>
<s> Bug: Sometimes when I want to click on a fragment in another window, I  </s>
<s> hit click, then click the target in the other window but the hypertext only contains the URI of the other window, *not* the fragment id.  </s>
<s> APPARENTLY ADDRESSED in 8.1 6. Bug: Not all id are shown when "show target" is selected.  </s>
<s> 7. Bug: When I click on the S030 hypertext in this document: it opens the other document in a new window, but then resets my view to the top of the page in my current window!  </s>
<s> 9. Bug: I encounter many instances that when (a) the cursor is before the first letter of a next word and after a space and the preceding word (b) and I hit the delete key (c) not only does it delete the first letter of the next word, but the preceding space.  </s>
<s> For example, where the carrot "^" represents the cursor position: "foo ^bar" [hit delete] "foo^ar" 10.  </s>
<s> Bug: When I want to click on a local fragment, I hit click, then if I hit page up or down I loose the "click activation", if I scroll then click, it opens another blank dialog.  </s>
<s> And update to the pending bugs.  </s>
<s> 11 has been updated with my suspicion of the cause (which was reminiscent of an older bug of not being able to treat sole 'id' attributes -- with 'name' -- correctly), and 12 is a new bug report of a crash.  </s>
<s> 11.  </s>
<s> Bug: When I want to click on a fragment in another window, I hit click, then click the target in the other window but the hypertext only contains the URI of the other window, *not* the fragment.  </s>
<s> (This seems to happen when I'm using XHTML documents without a 'name' but only an 'id'.) 12. Bug: Amaya 8.1 seems a little more unstable than 7.2 For example, go to my team page (W3C team access only) and place the cursor besides "checker" in the Tools heading: and hit 'Enter', amaya crashes.  </s>
<s> Hello Joseph, I have found the way to reproduce the bug 11.  </s>
<s> I don't have the fix for the moment, I need to investigate more.  </s>
<s> It comes effectively from a sole 'id' attribute.  </s>
<s> The bug 12 has been fixed today (Ralph reported a similar crash) and will be available tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Thanks Laurent  </s>
