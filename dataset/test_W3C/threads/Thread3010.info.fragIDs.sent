<s> This is a request for clarification in the HTTP/1.1 standard.  </s>
<s> Perhaps something for the accumulating errata.  </s>
<s> 1. When an origin server selects the response by looking at a request header, and the header does not exist, is it correct for the server to add the name of that header to Vary?  </s>
<s> For example, suppose a server's logic is like this pseudo-code: reponse_headers (Vary) = "Accept-Language" IF request_headers (Accept-Language) contains "ja" THEN serve the japanese page ELSE serve the english page ENDIF What is the correct HTTP response when the request doesn't have an Accept-Language header?  </s>
<s> I would guess that the correct response is to "include Vary: Accept-Language", but that begs the next question:  </s>
<s> 2. How should a cache treat missing requests headers which are mentioned in Vary, when deciding if a stored entity matches a request?  </s>
<s> a. If the stored entity was requested _without_ the header mentioned in Vary, and the new request is also _without_ the header, does the stored entity match?  </s>
<s> (This would come from scenario 1 above).  </s>
<s> b.  </s>
<s> If the stored entity was requested _without_ the header mentioned in Vary, and the new request is _with_ the header, does the stored entity match?  </s>
<s> c.  </s>
<s> If the stored entity was requested _with_ the header mentioned in Vary, and the new request is _without_ the header, does the stored entity match?  </s>
<s> I would imagine that in case a, the entity matches, and in cases b and c, the entity doesn't match and must be revalidated.  </s>
<s> But the language of RFC 2616 is a unclear: When the cache receives a subsequent request whose Request-URI specifies one or more cache entries including a Vary header field, the cache MUST NOT use such a cache entry to construct a response to the new request unless all of the selecting request-headers present in the new request match the corresponding stored request-headers in the original request.  </s>
<s> Can the selecting request-headers "match" if they are absent?  </s>
<s> What about case a?  </s>
<s> The selecting request-headers from two requests are defined to match if and only if the selecting request-headers in the first request can be transformed to the selecting request-headers in the second request by adding or removing linear white space (LWS) at places where this is allowed by the corresponding BNF, and/or combining multiple message-header fields with the same field name following the rules about message headers in section 4.2.  </s>
<s> Is this supposed to mean that an absent header is equivalent to an empty header, or that an absent header is semantically a distinct value from an empty header, or that an absent header is not considered at all in the decision, or that an absent header cannot be matched even with an absent header in the original request for the cached entity?  </s>
<s> 3. Does this mean that server code which inspects a header value, and finds the header missing, should look like this instead?  </s>
<s> IF exists request_headers (Accept-Language) THEN reponse_headers (Vary) = "Accept-Language" ELSE response_headers (Vary) = "*" ENDIF IF request_headers (Accept-Language) contains "ja" THEN serve the japanese page ELSE serve the english page ENDIF  </s>
<s> This question has come up because I am writing some simple server code which creates Vary headers when the application examines the value of a request-header.  </s>
<s> Yet, reading RFC 2616 doesn't seem to clarify what the server code should do in these cases; it sheds no light on it at all.  </s>
<s> The conservative thing to do is to disable cacheing when an examined request-header is absent, but that seems excessively pessimistic.  </s>
<s> I was prompted to ask here, after reading the HTTP/1.1 errata document and seeing nothing that clarifies this question.  </s>
<s> Can anyone shed any light on this?  </s>
<s> Thanks, -- Jamie  </s>
<s> If cachable response depends on header X, the server must add a Vary: X or Vary: * header.  </s>
<s> This behavior should be independent from actual headers present in the request (IMO).  </s>
<s> As you know, RFC 2616 defines Vary matching based on the existence of a LWS/merge transformation.  </s>
<s> Such transformation cannot add new or remove existing headers.  </s>
<s> Thus, IMO, a present header can never match an absent header.  </s>
<s> An absent header matches an absent header.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> If both requests lack a varied header X, then a null transformation (i.e., transformation that does nothing) matches them.  </s>
<s> To match a header without a field-value with an absent header one would need to add a header name to one of the requests, which is probably not a part of the allowed transformation.  </s>
<s> However, a header without field-value and/or a header without field-content (RFC 2616 BNF is ambiguous in this context) are strange animals, and I would not recommend counting on any specific implementation of related requirements.  </s>
<s> I would add Vary header unconditionally.  </s>
<s> Whether you want to disable caching depending on request properties is a question that goes beyond protocol semantics.  </s>
<s> The right thing to do would depend on the trade-off between more hits and fewer incorrect objects delivered.  </s>
<s> Note that a valid Accept-Language cannot be empty.  </s>
<s> It is not clear, however, how an invalid header is supposed to be treated by the matching algorithm in the RFC.  </s>
<s> Alex.  </s>
<s> I agree totally with you, Alex.  </s>
<s> Sure, forget about my caching preferences.  </s>
<s> I wanted to know if it was technically ok to add the Vary header unconditionally - and more importantly, if that would work according to everyone else's reading of the standard.  </s>
<s> Ok, but that's a different question from the one I'm interested in.  </s>
<s> I would like to see the language of the standard clarified to cover the case of absent headers mentioned in Vary, so that there is no confusion.  </s>
<s> The two paragraphs I cited seem contradictory, given a strict reading of the language.  </s>
<s> To cut to the precise language which is ambiguous: *all of the selecting request-headers present in the new request match the corresponding stored request-headers in the original request.*  </s>
<s> In my understanding of English, if the marked text begin with "each" instead of "all", it's unambiguous but means the wrong thing.  </s>
<s> (It means to try each selecting request-header in the new request, and one at a time match it against the corresponding stored request-header).  </s>
<s> "All" in that position can mean _either_ the same as "each", or that all the new request-headers are taken as a set and matched against all the stored request-headers as a set, in one single match operation.  </s>
<s> It depends how you parse the quantifier.  </s>
<s> Matching as a set is wanted, and the next paragraph confirms that interpretation, although it wasn't until you drew my attention to it that it made sense to me that way.  </s>
<s> Better language may be: When the cache receives a subsequent request whose Request-URI specifies one or more cache entries including a Vary header field, the cache MUST NOT use such a cache entry to construct a response to - the new request unless all of the selecting request-headers present - in the new request match the corresponding stored request-headers in + the new request unless the set of selecting request-headers present + in the new request matches the set of selecting request-headers stored in the original request.  </s>
<s> The selecting request-headers from two requests are defined to match if and only if the selecting request-headers in the first request can be transformed to the selecting request-headers in the second request by adding or removing linear white space (LWS) at places where this is allowed by the corresponding BNF, and/or combining multiple message-header fields with the same field name following the rules about message headers in section 4.2.  </s>
<s> + Headers may be named in the Vary field value which do not exist in + one or both requests.  </s>
<s> Headers which are named in the Vary field + value and do not exist in one request are matched if and only if + the corresponding headers do not exist in the other request.  </s>
<s> That last paragraph is a logical consequence of the preceding two paragraphs, if you read them the right way.  </s>
<s> However, I have read the standard many times and implemented a HTTP/1.1 server, and not understood that logical consequence until now.  </s>
<s> So the extra clarifying paragraph is suggested.  </s>
<s> Thanks, -- Jamie  </s>
