<s> Who's supposed to be making our case at the W3C level?  </s>
<s> I've just seen a lengthy report from a UK representative of last month's W3C meeting, and XML is barely there: 2 one-line mentions in a 10-page report on a 3-day meeting.  </s>
<s> Numerous questions were raised to which XML is the answer, but apparently no-one gave that answer, e.g. "Some felt that there should be an HTML extension mechanism (similar to PEP for HTTP).  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly would produce a HTML briefing paper".  </s>
<s> Why doesn't this say "Dan Connolly pointed out that XML addressed this need directly."?  </s>
<s> ht  </s>
<s> I attended that meeting and tried to put in a plug for XML whenever I could.  </s>
<s> The W3C folks tried hard to downplay SGML and XML, but they did not manage to keep me quiet.  </s>
<s> It seems clear that they consider XML a bit of a threat and are trying to minimize its role.  </s>
<s> The best way that we can overcome that  </s>
<s> is to demonstrate the uefulness and practicality of XML as compared to HTML.  </s>
<s> Interest in growing, but it will take time and demonstrable software to sway more people to our side.  </s>
<s> I expect to be atending the next AC meeting on June 17/18.  </s>
<s> Having software to demonstrate at that meeting would be a big help in pushing XML higher up on the agenda for the consortium.  </s>

<s> It is competitive.  </s>
<s> We have to live with that and understand the competition.  </s>
<s> The W3C consortium is a collection of conflicting interests.  </s>
<s> Go where they need this: not where they fear it.  </s>
<s> This is when alliance with ISO and WG8 plays to an advantage.  </s>
<s> Don't compare this to HTML.  </s>
<s> Don't compare this to Acrobat.  </s>
<s> This is SGML made practical for practical requirements.  </s>
<s> Figure out what those requirements are first.  </s>

<s> I think Dan, I and others were discussing some sort of HTML extension mechanism even as far back in the plastocene when the html-wg was still wandering the earth in search of small reptiles to eat.  </s>
<s> I remember attempting to get IANA to register extension names.  </s>
<s> A lifetime ago.  </s>
<s> The modularization of the HTML DTD was an early attempt at what Dan called a "platform for experimentation", and would still be (I believe) the mechanism whereby HTML extensions would be added.  </s>
<s> But as we all know, there's not too many HTML UAs that even bother to interpret the FPI in DOCTYPE, much less parse a DTD or perform entity management, so I think this effort is really doomed to failure.  </s>
<s> It's funny that we're just now discussing one of the features that HTML would need in order to provide some measure of ordered extension functionality: catalogs and entity management.  </s>
<s> Because in HTML there seems to be no movement towards greater interoperability and modularity (in fact, movement away from it if anything) I think the 'X' in XML will never make it over to prefix 'HTML', unless one counts ActiveX, etc. as extensibility.  </s>

<s> (This thread seems to have appeared out of nowhere.  </s>
<s> Did someone's private correspondence get forwarded to the list?) [Len Bullard:]  </s>
<s> Yes. I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of this point.  </s>
<s> HTML is almost perfectly suited to the problem space it was originally designed to address, and for that reason it will probably be around for decades to come.  </s>
<s> It is a big mistake to position XML as competition to HTML.  </s>
<s> XML is not going to take over HTML's problem space, and suggesting that it might just generates needless hostility.  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> I suspect Dan would argue with that proposition; I'm fairly sure TBL would if pinned down.  </s>
<s> Nobody on W3C staff said a kind word for XML when I and others brought it up.  </s>
<s> XML was not given air time; or rather it was listed on the agenda but time ran out during the final "quiz the staff" session.  </s>
<s> I hope next year someone from the SGML ERB will be given an hour to present the glowing success story.  </s>
<s> But we'll have to get XML far up the pipeline in the W3C process for that to happen; that pipeline is clogged, and if XML doesn't burst loose in Santa Clara it might not get another chance this year.  </s>

<s> Jon Bosak:  </s>
<s> Really?  </s>
<s> No comparison of XML and HTML?  </s>
<s> It makes sense to avoid denigrating  </s>
<s> HTML, but the question of how XML and HTML compare is going to ask itself, and loudly.  </s>
<s> People have been confused about HTML and SGML for years, and the introduction of XML into their vocabularies will only accentuate the need for rational comparisons.  </s>
<s> It doesn't matter whether comparing XML and HTML is the "wrong question."  </s>
<s> It's the question that everyone will ask.  </s>
<s> Even when we acknowledge the fit of HTML's design to its problem space, some folks will bristle when we suggest that HTML's problem space isn't infinite.  </s>
<s> (Doesn't Netscape's indifference to XML suggest a belief in the sufficiency of HTML?) Even if HTML users agree that XML solves certain problems more efficiently than HTML-plus-programs can, they will have to spend real money to take advantage of XML technology.  </s>
<s> People will need comparisons to make sensible business investments.  </s>
<s> And investments require that businesses assess *competitive* advantages of their investment options: XML or HTML, and for which applications?  </s>
<s> We certainly shouldn't generate needless hostility.  </s>
<s> And the XML initiative can certainly proceed without being hostile.  </s>
<s> But some hostility will greet whatever this initiative produces, and with a proper XML story, which includes SGML-XML-HTML comparisions, that hostility can be defused and can work to XML's advantage.  </s>
