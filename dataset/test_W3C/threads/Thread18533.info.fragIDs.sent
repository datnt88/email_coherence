<s> Martin, Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed your last call issues (327-337, refer to the email summarizing the issues [0]).  </s>
<s> The complete second last call issues list [1] is available online.  </s>
<s> The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].  </s>
<s> NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call draft [4].  </s>
<s> In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.  </s>
<s> Please indicate whether you are satisfied with the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward any objections to the Director as the document advances, or whether you require further clarification or comment.  </s>
<s> Refer to section 5.5.2 of the 8 February 2001 W3C Process Document [3] for information about requirements to formally address issues prior to advancing to last call.  </s>
<s> On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and comments, - Ian [0] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0243 [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/ [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#last-call [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/  </s>
<s> The UAWG disagreed with you on the following: #331: Add a requirement for configurability based on natural language preferences?  </s>
<s> Comment: The Working Group did not add a requirement to the document for general configurability based on natural language preferences.  </s>
<s> Instead, for the requirements related to speech rate and visual text rendering, the techniques document suggest per-language configurability.  </s>
<s> The UAWG agreed with you, but please confirm: #329: Checkpoint 2.7: Clarification required about boundaries of "recognized but unsupported" Comment: What is now checkpoint 2.10 states: "2.10 Allow configuration not to render content in unsupported natural languages.  </s>
<s> Indicate to the user in context that author-supplied content has not been rendered."  </s>
<s> #332: Repair requirement for when author has not specified natural language of content?  </s>
<s> Comment: The Working Group agreed.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 4.15 includes a requirement to support user-defined extensions to the speech dictionary.  </s>
<s> #337: Conformance: Implementing the standard API for the keyboard "after IME" Comment: Checkpoint 6.7 now reads (notice plural APIs): 6.7 Implement the operating environment's standard APIs for the keyboard.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Note: An operating environment may define more than one standard API for the keyboard.  </s>
<s> For instance, for Japanese and Chinese, input may be processed in two stages, with an API for each.  </s>
<s> The UAWG adopted your suggestion: #327: Add requirement for support of charset expected of each API?  </s>
<s> Comment: This is checkpoint 6.8 of the 9 March 2001 draft.  </s>
<s> #328: Checkpoint 4.12: "Words" per minute bounds do not scale internationally.  </s>
<s> Comment: This is checkpoint 4.11 in the 9 March 2001 draft.  </s>
<s> The words per minute requirements have been removed.  </s>
<s> The techniques document states: "For example, many speech synthesizers offer a range for English speech of 120 - 500 words per minute or more.  </s>
<s> The user should be able to increase or decrease the playback rate in convenient increments (e.g., in large steps, then in small steps for finer control)."  </s>
<s> #330: Definition: Natural language / Writing system / Script Comment: The proposed clarifications and addition of the I18N usage of the term "Script" were incorporated into the document.  </s>
<s> #336: Checkpoint 9.2: Delete "accessibility" from "OS accessibility conventions"?  </s>
<s> Comment: Adopted.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 7.2 now reads: "7.2 Ensure that default input configurations do not interfere with operating environment accessibility conventions."  </s>
<s> The UAWG answered the following questions: #333: Checkpoint 4.2: Clarification required about what "all text" means Comment: The Note after checkpoint 4.2 now reads: "Note: For example, allow the user to specify that all text is to be rendered in a particular sans-serif font family.  </s>
<s> For text that cannot be rendered properly using the user's selected font family, the user agent may select an alternative font family."  </s>
<s> #334: Checkpoint 7.5: Input to search capability not always "plain text" (may be speech, braille) Comment: The Working Group clarified that the search requirement is only on text characters.  </s>
<s> The input method is not addressed by this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> #335: Checkpoint 9.5: Need to consider international input methods in single-key requirement Comment: The single-key requirement is not about characters but about physical keys.  </s>
<s> I have recently proposed a further clarification to what is now checkpoint 11.3 to state this more clearly: Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> [snip] Martin, In my previous email I did not include a deadline: Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward any objections to the Director as the document advances, or whether you require further clarification or comment.  </s>
<s> If you do not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  </s>
<s> The Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the disposition of comments or not.  </s>
<s> Thank you, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> Hello Ian - I'm forwarding this to the I18N IG, since these are all I18N issues.  </s>
<s> I18N IG - Ian has indicated to me that he needs a response by March 27th.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
