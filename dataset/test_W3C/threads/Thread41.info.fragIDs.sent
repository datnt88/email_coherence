<s> I'm using tidy as a last cleanup step after stripping those tags from an HTML file.  </s>
<s> The idea is to get my 'almost' XML' file cleaned up by tidy before presenting it to an XML parser.  </s>
<s> Inasmuch as I am retired and therefor have lots of "play time" on my hands, I decided to convert all of my existing web pages (78) from existing HTML 4.0/4.01 to XHTML 1.0 (although I have retained copies in the HTML iterations in case I want to revert).  </s>
<s> I did this for there seems to be no doubt that XHTML will soon be adopted as the defacto web authoring language in order to accommodate the various wireless/handheld device Browsers that will soon be forthcoming.  </s>
<s> The DTD's for XHTML 1.0 are now available for Validation on the W3C page (I provide a clickable hyperlink on the Validation page of my mini-site in my signature block).  </s>
<s> Of course the current iteration of XHTML 1.0 is at present only a proposed recommendation of W3C (the usual Caveats apply), but I believe the eventual form and substance will not differ too much - if the DTD's change somewhat, I will adjust my coding.  </s>
<s> In any event, I have validated all of my pages as XHTML 1.0 in the W3C HTML validator, the W3C Cascading Style Sheet validator and the XML.com (RUWF - R U Well Formed?) validator (again, I have provided a hyperlink to this facility on the Validation page of my mini-site).  </s>
<s> The point of all this is that I used TIDY to convert all of my web pages to XML/XHTML - solely - I just ran 'em through with nary a hitch!  </s>
<s> (Of course, I had previously validated the HTML code).  </s>
<s> So far I have checked my XHTML 1.0 pages in the following Browsers, where they perform/display as designed: MS Internet Explorer ver 5.0 MS Internet Explorer ver 4.0, 4.x Netscape Navigator 4.x Opera 3.60 Web TV 2.0 Lynx 2.7, 2.8 Amaya 2.2 OBR (Optical Braille Recognition) Thanks Dave Raggett!

<s> Hi Dave, Tidy has an option in the Config file to add a line-break before a BR tag, but it seems (in the Macintosh "MacTidy" version at least), that a line-break is performed after a BR tag, whether or not the "break-before-br" option is set to yes or no.  </s>

<s> Hi, When I set output-xml: yes why does the output include html , head , title and body tags when my original file doesn't include these tags?  </s>
