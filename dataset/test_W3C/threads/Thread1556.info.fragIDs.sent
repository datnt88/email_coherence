<s> Consider that I have a collection under baseline control.  </s>
<s> I want to check out a specific version resource (to get a working resource) from a specific baseline of that collection.  </s>
<s> Or in other words, you want to checkout a particular baseline to get a "working baseline"?  </s>
<s> I believe the order of operations would be: PROPFIND /my/coll DAV:baseline-selector CHECKOUT /the/baseline/selector Label: which-baseline DAV:apply-to-version I'm presuming that the latter will create the working resource for me.  </s>
<s> The "Label" header makes the CHECKOUT method apply to the specified baseline (rather than to the baseline selector), so the DAV:apply-to-version argument is redundant.  </s>

<s> Label: which-baseline A baseline selector is not a collection ... it is just a resource that you can checkout and checkin to create new baselines.  </s>
<s> Many baseline implementations will be things like "an internal label" or "a list of version URL's", which do not directly provide collection semantics.  </s>

<s> If not, then is there a way to do this?  </s>
<s> Would I have to create a new baseline selector, UDPATE it, then CHECKOUT/apply-to-version? Almost.  </s>
<s> You can create a new collection (reasonably enough, since you do want a collection :-), and then put it under baseline control, i.e.: MKCOL /collection/for-baseline/foo BASELINE-CONTROL /collection/for-baseline/foo DAV:baseline /baseline/xyz34 CHECKOUT /collection/for-baseline/foo/some/file.c  </s>
<s> Note that you can continue to use /my/collection for all your subsequent checkouts against baseline foo ... so you only have to do the BASELINE-CONTROL once for any checkout against that baseline.  </s>
<s> (I hope not because that doesn't scale as well) For many implementations (such as the very common label-based baseline implementation), that is the only way it will scale well, because it tells the server when to "cache" a traversable form of the baseline, and when to empty that "cache" (i.e. when /my/collection is deleted).  </s>
<s> In subversion, the BASELINE-CONTROL is a trivial operation, because your baselines are already in traversable form.  </s>
<s> So the cost to you is that protocol asks you to "publish" important baselines in the form of baseline-controlled collections, i.e. give them human meaningful URL's.  </s>
<s> I agree that the intermediate BASELINE-CONTROL step is not optimized towards your implementation (which does not need it), but it is needed for interoperability with most other baseline implementations.  </s>

<s> Grr. The below doesn't work either.  </s>
<s> The Label: would apply to file.c, not /the/baseline/selector.  </s>
<s> Okay... separate question: can I "slash through" a baseline?  </s>
<s> Off the cuff, I'd say "no, the baseline is an arbitrary set of version resources, rather than a structured/hierarchical set of version resources."  </s>
<s> The problem is how to get to a specific version resource given a label for a baseline and a (relative) path within that baseline.  </s>
<s> And in as few operations as possible, of course :-) Cheers, -g  </s>

<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> The problem is how to get to a specific version resource given a label for a baseline and a (relative) path within that baseline.  </s>
<s> And in as few operations as possible, of course :-) You would have to: - locate that baseline, - use BASELINE-CONTROL to instantiate that baseline in some collection, and - issue the checkout against the appropriate member of that collection Assume that /repo/proj1 identifies your subversion repository, you want the baseline labeled "foo", and the name in that baseline was "/some/file.c"  </s>
<s> (and specifying just enough XML to get the point across): PROPFIND /repo/proj1 = PROPFIND /bs/x235 Label: foo = BASELINE-CONTROL /baseline-collection/proj1/foo CHECKOUT /baseline-collection/proj1/foo/some/file.c  </s>
<s> The choice of the name for this baseline controlled collection is up to the client.  </s>
<s> This client probably called it "foo" because the baseline is currently labeled foo, so that seems a reasonable thing to put in the URL for that collection.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> That is exactly the issue that I'm pondering on :-) Okay... thanks for the feedback.  </s>
<s> I'll figure out a way to deal with this, then.  </s>
<s> I don't think that we can be truly interoperable because of the question "where can I create that (temporary) baseline-controlled collection (BCC)?"  </s>
<s> I can detect an SVN server and know where an automatically constructed BCC exists, but if the server is *not* an SVN server, then I will need to know a location to create that BCC. [ effectively, I will automatically create a BCC each time a baseline is created (via a check-in/merge).  </s>
<s> a property on the public VCR will tell me the collection containing the BCCs.  </s>
