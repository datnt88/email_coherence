<s> I thought that issue 118[2] was resolved, but I actually think that the spec is lacking some clarification.  </s>
<s> The specification says[1]: The SOAP root attribute can be used to label serialization roots that are not true roots of an object graph so that the object graph can be deserialized.  </s>
<s> The attribute can have one of two values, either "true" or "false".  </s>
<s> True roots of an object graph have the implied attribute value of "true".  </s>
<s> Serialization roots that are not true roots can be labeled as serialization roots with an attribute value of "true".  </s>
<s> An element can explicitly be labeled as not being a serialization root with a value of "false".  </s>
<s> The SOAP root attribute MAY appear on any subelement within the SOAP Header and SOAP Body elements.  </s>
<s> The attribute does not have a default value.  </s>
<s> I think that something is missing here: The type of the root attribute information item is boolean in the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.  </s>
<s> The reason for that is that "true" or "false" are canonical values for a schema boolean, whereas in the current text, it can be interpreted as "true" or "false" litterally, i.e. "0" and "1" being not allowed.  </s>
<s> I will keep the issue opened until advisement by the editors on this.  </s>

<s> Are you saying that it is not clear from the text that the type is boolean?  </s>
<s> I would tend to say that we should refer to the schema rather than saying what type it is in the text - it seems more brittle to have the definition in multiple places.  </s>

<s> Indeed, the text says that the value of the root attribute can be either "true" of "false".  </s>
<s> Without saying that it's a boolean as defined by schema, nothing in the text says that it can also be "1" or "0".  </s>
<s> I have no problem with adding a link to the schema too, but I think it's underspecified right now.  </s>
<s> The mustUnderstand attribute is clearly identified as a boolean[1]: The mustUnderstand attribute information item has the following Infoset properties: * A local name of mustUnderstand; * A namespace name of http://www.w3.org/2001/06/soap-envelope; * A specified property with a value of true.  </s>
<s> The type of the mustUnderstand attribute information item is boolean in the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.  </s>
<s> Omitting this  </s>
<s> attribute information item is defined as being semantically equivalent to including it with a value of "false".  </s>
<s> I think that the root attribute should get the same treatment.  </s>
