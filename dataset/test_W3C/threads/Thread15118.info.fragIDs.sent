<s> I would say that few HTML *elements* are specifically important to accessibility.  </s>
<s> object is one.  </s>
<s> What's really important are *attributes*, some of which are perennially ignored (like title on everything), others required (like alt on area and img ).  </s>
<s> The minimum level success criteria for checkpoint 1.3 are: 1. any information that is conveyed through presentation formatting is also provided in either text or structure.  </s>
<s> Maybe someone could explain what that bit means.  </s>
<s> Aren't we really trying to say "Don't use HTML incorrectly"?  </s>
<s> (That's another guideline already, isn't it?)  </s>
<s> In other words, an ill-informed developer might use to make a paragraph *look* like a header to a sighted person, but the structure of the h1 through h6 tags is lost.  </s>
<s> A plain reading of the requirement above would force someone who wanted to use p big bold font color="red" to *also* surround all that in heading tags.  </s>
<s> I think not.  </s>
<s> These seem to fall into 2 categories: 1. those elements that genuinely provide structure, are commonly used, and make a much larger accessibility impact when they are used.  </s>
<s> e.g. H1-H6, UL, OL LI, TH, LABEL, etc.  </s>
<s> i.e., are well-supported by current browsers and adaptive technology, which falsely leads us to believe they are more important.  </s>
<s> 2. those elements that are not commonly used or supported and do not provide a large accessibility benefit.  </s>
<s> e.g. CITE, VAR, KBD, etc.  </s>
<s> i.e., are poorly-supported by current browsers and adaptive technology, which falsely leads us to believe they are less important.  </s>
<s> (And I dispute that cite , var , and kbd are poorly-supported.  </s>
<s> If anything is poorly supported, object is.) Browser and (for example) screen-reader makers are both guilty here.  </s>
<s> Try finding a browser that supports *all*, absolutely all, of HTML 4, a specification dating back to 1999.  </s>
<s> (summary on table , anyone?  </s>
<s> cite on blockquote , perhaps?) Even getting something as simple as longdesc support out of these people is like pulling teeth.  </s>
<s> (iCab, Moz, and NN6 have it.  </s>
<s> IE doesn't.) Now try to find a screen reader that understands *all*, and I do mean all, of the accessibility elements and attributes available in HTML.  </s>
<s> (How about longdesc on iframe ?  </s>
<s> How about nested object ?  </s>
<s> How about title on everything, and yes, *title is an accessibility feature*, as I have tried to explain before?) "Not commonly used" is irrelevant.  </s>

<s> "Not commonly... supported"?  </s>
<s> At least you're being honest.  </s>
<s> You're saying, in effect, "Jaws for Windows can't handle it, so let's pretend it doesn't matter."  </s>
<s> (That's merely to draw one example.)  </s>
<s> They don't provide a sizable benefit because if you don't know that something is a citation by the markup  </s>
<s> This is self-contradictory.  </s>
<s> If you mark it up with cite /cite , it is up to your browser or adaptive technology to *tell* you it's a citation!  </s>
<s> If an author marks up a citation correctly, he or she has done the job.  </s>
<s> Responsibility then falls to the browser or device.  </s>
<s> hopefully you can glean that from the context.  </s>
<s> Unlike headings which can be used as navigation markers as well as create the structure that the document is built on.  </s>
<s> Here you are specifically referring to an *interface* currently used in screen readers (and one browser-- iCab will list a page's headers for you).  </s>
<s> You are allowing this currently-used interface to influence your conception of what's important in HTML markup.  </s>
<s> All HTML markup is important.  </s>
<s> Some of it may be more *useful*, but that's a different question.  </s>
<s> Following this line of thinking, HTML elements that, say, Jaws for Windows can't list in a handy-dandy group should all be eliminated.  </s>
<s> The thinking here seems to be "Wow.  </s>
<s> Jaws lets a blind person navigate from heading to heading.  </s>
<s> That's just so terribly clever.  </s>
<s> Why didn't I think of that?  </s>
<s> I feel slightly embarrassed that I didn't.  </s>
<s> So headings must be really important then!  </s>
<s> And who uses var anyway?"  </s>
<s> Let me add that this habit of being influenced by current adaptive technology (invariably meaning a screen reader, invariably meaning Jaws for Windows) leads to absurd advice that gets accessibility advocates laughed out of the room.  </s>
<s> Example: Claiming that all text between a and /a tags must be self-explanatory on the off chance that someone is perusing the document link by link.  </s>
<s> That's not how hypertext works; a is an inline element and can and should be used smack dab in the middle of a sentence if that's what you want to do.  </s>
<s> I see a call for people to "glean that from context" in the discussion of cite above; why is that desirable here but not in the case of freeform link text?  </s>
<s> But I digress.  </s>
<s> Does this make more sense now?  </s>
<s> Can you see how a sub-priority scheme is almost forming from this?  </s>
<s> Or do you think they are all equally important?  </s>
<s> No. No. Yes.  </s>
<s> This might be an incorrect premise on my part (that some are less important to accessibility than others).  </s>
<s> Some HTML elements are treated more *conspicuously* by certain *present-day devices*, leading to the misapprehension that they really are indisputably more important and everything else can be eliminated.  </s>
<s> This kind of Oprah effect-- "Oprah mentioned the h6 tag on her show today!  </s>
<s> We really ought to treat it special!"-- is to be discouraged.  </s>
<s> I am not really wild about fashioning the WCAG around the deficiencies of current adaptive technology.  </s>
<s> We're already stuck with requirements like this one--  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#tech-divide-links  </s>
<s> Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render adjacent links distinctly, include non-link, printable characters (surrounded by spaces) between adjacent links.  </s>
<s> Adjacent links are *always* discernible in valid HTML.  </s>
<s> Example: is quite clearly four separate links.  </s>
<s> If your adaptive technology can't keep them straight (or your visual browser uses an unbroken underline for all four, making you think they're a single unit), that's not our problem.  </s>
<s> We shouldn't be saddled with a requirement to *work around* errors in adaptive technology essentially forever.  </s>
<s> (Pedants always conveniently omit the "until user agents" part, and in any event it causes developers to be guilty until proven innocent: "Unless you can prove that adaptive technology no longer needs this addition, I am going to accuse you of negligently designing an inaccessible site."  </s>
<s> This *is* in fact the tone often used with developers.  </s>
<s> High dudgeon can be called for, but certainly not in this case-- the *requirement* is broken!) Let's break out of the habit of accommodating the peccadilloes of software makers who cannot be bothered to support all of HTML.  </s>
<s> And I do mean *all*.  </s>
<s> Nor should we be influenced by the way current software does things.  </s>

<s> (mine exclude) On to the main.....inline comments to Joe's points  </s>
<s> 1. any information that is conveyed through presentation formatting is also provided in either text or structure.  </s>
<s> Maybe someone could explain what that bit means.  </s>
<s> [Lisa] Ok - there is always a lot of content that is implied in the presentation.  </s>
<s> When that content is definitive, make sure it is also conveyed in structure or text.  </s>
<s> So if you have an e-commerce site that is having a sale.  </s>
<s> and the words "SALE" and any items on sale are all in green.  </s>
<s> Make sure that there is another way to know what items are on sale besides the green.  </s>
<s> [Lisa] even if someone reads the requirement and as a result raps p big bold font color="red" in heading tags, that is a lot better then just having the p big bold .  </s>
<s> A user agent can know what to do with a header, and that information - that this is a heading - has been preserved.  </s>
<s> "Not commonly used" is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> If it's in the spec, it must be supported.  </s>
<s> "Not commonly... supported"?  </s>

<s> In the same way abridged text may leave in the links.  </s>
<s> It is not common.  </s>
<s> It may yet become so, but it is a help for accessibility.  </s>
<s> also links are often separated by white spaces or the visual lay out of the page so links do not make any since when they are read.  </s>
<s> For example a table layout which has lots of "more" links on one cell , so they are layout next to the content they are affiliated to.  </s>

<s> As a practical point, T.V. Raman's Emacspeak software applies aural CSS, allowing it to give a distinctive spoken rendering of each type of HTML element; it can also invoke XSLT style sheets to give, for example, an outline of the document or to render tables more intelligibly.  </s>
<s> This is just one example of what can be and has been achieved in actual implementation.  </s>
<s> Of course, braille translation software, as I pointed out in an earlier message, also relies heavily on proper document structure in order to generate appropriate formatting.  </s>
<s> The advantage of SGML, XML, therefore HTML/XHTML, Docbook, the TEI DTD, Daisy/Niso, SVG etc., is the support they provide for distinguishing structure from presentation, allowing content to be reused and transformed in ways that the author may not have had in mind originally.  </s>
<s> The problem with designing content only to satisfy the features available in popular assistive technologies is that it assumes some peoples' assistive technologies are more important than others, limits the ability of current and future technologies to take full advantage of the logical structure, fails to gain the benefits of separating style from structure (including more powerful styling options with CSS, XSLT etc.); and adds to the legacy of poorly structured content that will be with us for years to come.  </s>
<s> For purposes of checkpoint 1.3 and setting priority levels, the issue is not what assistive technologies support or do not support, but rather which semantic distinctions are most important.  </s>
<s> This is basically the approach currently taken in 1.3, success criterion 2, as well as in checkpoint 3.1.  </s>
<s> I think it would be worthwhile to review these success criteria and decide which should fall under each checkpoint, but I don't have time to think it through just at the moment.  </s>
<s> What the first success criterion in 1.3 means, in effect, is that if you are using style to convey a certain structural distinction (layout, fonts, or in a speech application, voice characteristics etc.), then you must ensure that the proper structural markup is included so that all the distinctions you have taken the trouble to emphasize using style characteristics are also expressed abstractly in the structure.  </s>
<s> In other words the first success criterion of 1.3 ties the author's decisions regarding structural markup/data model to their decisions regarding presentation: whatever structure is distinctive in the presentation should also be distinctive in the more abstract, structural markup.  </s>
<s> The second success criterion is supposed to catch those cases in which there is no intended presentation (the author hasn't bothered about presentation; perhaps the content is in a format which isn't intended to be presented directly to the user, but will be presented after other transformations have been applied to it; or perhaps not all of the distinctions important to accessibility are made in whatever presentation is associated with the content, though the latter possibility should be ruled out by checkpoint 3.1).  </s>
<s> One way of thinking of it is as follows: Whatever structure is clearly evident from presentation must be explicitly given in abstract, structural markup or a data model.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 3.1 requires that the structure be provided in the first place, that is, the author must impose structure upon the content that is created, and must, moreover, do it in such a way as to enhance navigation and comprehension.  </s>
<s> As I said, I think these success criteria could benefit from some work, but I don't have time for it in the near future; but if anyone wants to examine the issues further they are most welcome to put forward a proposal.  </s>
<s> In general I don't think our success criteria are guilty of this, though anyone who thinks they are is welcome, indeed encouraged, to point out places where it occurs.  </s>
<s> The other issue to bear in mind here is that WCAG also provides the basis of the requirements in the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines; the priorities in WCAG have a significant impact on the requirements and priorities of UAAG.  </s>
<s> Thus if we were to set priorities on the basis of what is commonly  </s>
<s> implemented, the effect would be (1) that authors aiming for level 1  </s>
<s> conformance would not implement them; (2) that they would be of lower priority in the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines; and (3) because of (1) and (2), user agent and authoring tool developers would be less inclined to implement them, resulting in a self-reinforcing cycle of non-implementation, independently of other motives that are likely to influence developers.  </s>
<s> Jason I completely agree.  </s>
<s> I think many people in the group would also agree with you.  </s>
<s> I bring this up because it was explained to me on a recent teleconference (where we were discussing Hebrew vowels) that our conditions for a requirement to be level one success criteria include that it is commonly implemented.  </s>
