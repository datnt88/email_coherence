<s> Whenever Mark or Sam linked to a story on another site, they wrapped cite tags around the name.  </s>
<s> So where you would write: a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> NY Times /a : "A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born."  </s>
<s> They'd do: cite NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> Some Article /a .  </s>
<s> "A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born."  </s>
<s> Now they have a script that looks for all these cite tags and reorganizes them by the thing being cited.  </s>
<s> So the NY Times page lists all entries that have cite NY Times /cite and so on.  </s>
<s> Aaron Swartz [http://www.aaronsw.com]  </s>
<s> The problem is that it relies on the ability of the person who writes to do it always in a consistent way, which is almost bearable with one author and almost impossible in a multiple authors environment :) and you can also do something like cite NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> Some Article /a .  </s>
<s> q cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born.  </s>
<s> /q I always thought that a mechanism was missing in HTML to associate authors and sources (like RDF does).  </s>
<s> Because even in my example you associate easily the title with the citation, but you do not associate the journal in a unique reference system.  </s>
<s> Add to that an author.  </s>
<s> cite NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> Some Article /a .  </s>
<s> q cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born.  </s>
<s> /q , cite Paul Smith /cite A reference system could have been, but not very practical: cite inref="art001" NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> inref="art001" Some Article /a .  </s>
<s> q cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> inref="art001" A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born.  </s>
<s> /q , cite inref="art001" Paul Smith /cite Another way could have been cite href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> NY Times /cite : a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> Some Article /a .  </s>
<s> q href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> A religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been born.  </s>
<s> /q , cite href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle"  </s>
<s> Paul Smith /cite :))) so much to do, the future has many things to come.  </s>
<s> And talk about poetry ;) and the structure of poems and it's even wider :) Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! ---  </s>
<s> Reading Mark Pilgrim [1] has an immediate benefit for the reader, activate the brain engine.  </s>
<s> Mark, keep going, it's great :) There are manuals [2] online for online citation where the reference is online.  </s>
<s> What about a french article (just for the purpose of another interesting attribute): Philippe Breton, "Le culte d'Internet", Le Monde Diplomatique, octobre 2000, page 36 citation: "Le culte de l'Internet est un culte jeune, de jeunes et pour les jeunes.  </s>
<s> Il est con?u comme une sorte de processus de ?  </s>
<s> r?volution permanente ?, o? ce sont les ?  </s>
<s> jeunes ?  </s>
<s> qui d?terminent la direction du mouvement."  </s>
<s> The usual citation system will be like: Breton, P. "Le culte d'Internet".  </s>
<s> Le Monde Diplomatique.  </s>
<s> octobre 2000: 36.  </s>
<s> The mark-up will be closeof that.  </s>
<s> a href="http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/10/BRETON/14335" hreflang="fr" Le culte d'Internet /a /q /cite .  </s>
<s> cite title="Newspaper" lang="fr" Le Monde Diplomatique /cite .  </s>
<s> cite title="Date" Octobre 2000 /cite : Le culte de l'Internet est un culte jeune, de jeunes et pour les jeunes.  </s>
<s> Il est con?u comme une sorte de processus de ?  </s>
<s> r?volution permanente ?, o? ce sont les ?  </s>
<s> jeunes ?  </s>
<s> qui d?terminent la direction du mouvement.  </s>
<s> All of this seems easy, but in some Weblog systems, or editing tools, it's very easy to have a menu which will deal with all of that.  </s>
<s> We do not have to bury the editor with tons of code but to give him/her the tools that will do it.  </s>
<s> I want to come back on some little things: * lang="fr" Gives the language of what you have cited.  </s>
<s> Very useful in an international context.  </s>
<s> On my personal weblog, which is in french, and have number of english citations, I'm using it all the time.  </s>
<s> Here I have supposed to be in an english context.  </s>
<s> Benefits: 1.  </s>
<s> If you do a script like the one of Mark Pilgrim, you can add feature like: "Give me all the french citations of my weblog".  </s>
<s> 2. Automatic translator could implement it to not translate part which should not.  </s>
<s> If you ask now to an automatic translator to translate the page from english to french, it will also try to translate the french in french.  </s>
<s> Stupid.  </s>
<s> * hreflang="fr" Not well known tag but that I have awakened [3] in the french web log community with the power of CSS.  </s>
<s> The two benefits: 1. (Now) You can display the language of the link for your user.  </s>
<s> So someone, who doesn't know at all french, will not be forced to follow the link and come back because he/she can't understand.  </s>
<s> How? with CSS rules.  </s>
<s> a[hreflang]:after { content: " [" attr(hreflang) "] "; font-size: 0.9em;} It will display the language of the resource just after the link between square brackets.  </s>
<s> In our example, it will give: Breton, P. "Le culte d'Internet [fr]".  </s>
<s> Le Monde Diplomatique.  </s>
<s> octobre 2000: 36.  </s>
<s> It's very useful for blogroll too or any links you have in your pages.  </s>
<s> 2. (Future) Search engines will benefit of it in the future and will have a better indexing if they know the language of the source before the indexation.  </s>
<s> * q I'm using the q tag because it has a very useful purpose which is to choose the right quotation mark depending on the language context.  </s>
<s> If you do a citation in french, you have to use ?  </s>
<s> blabla ?, in english, "blabla", in spanish, etc.  </s>
<s> The spaces and the characters used are different depending on the nesting language of the citation, not the citation itself.  </s>
<s> The problem is that it's not yet well displayed in Mozilla, they are fixing it.  </s>
<s> Mac IE 5 does it right.  </s>
<s> PS: Now I have to translate all of that to put on my weblog :p [1] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope [2] http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/online/citex.html  </s>
