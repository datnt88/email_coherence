<s> Hello, The Math Working Group has reviewed the DOM Level 3 Validation Specification, and we have no objections to it.  </s>
<s> However, we'd like to inquire about the possibility of more stringent validation for particular XML dialects.  </s>
<s> In some cases notably MathML and HTML) there are restrictions in the recommendations which aren't codifiable in a DTD or W3C XML Schema.  </s>
<s> Do you feel that it would be appropriate for us to define an extension of the NodeEditVAL interface for the MathML DOM, adding a new CheckTypeVAL constant so that validation would include these non-codifiable restrictions?  </s>
<s> (This would be named something like "MATHML_STRICT_VALIDITY_CHECK", and would of necessity includes STRICT_VALIDITY_CHECK.) A feature string such as "MATHML-VAL-DOC" would be needed as well.  </s>
<s> Or do you see this as exceeding the mandate of validation?  </s>
<s> thanks, Ron Ausbrooks  </s>
<s> We considered your proposal.  </s>
<s> We decided against incorporating it into the validation spec; however, if groups such as yours wish to add such extensions on their own, that would be ok.  </s>
<s> We will add documentation to that effect.  </s>
<s> Please let us know if you are satisfied (or not) with the resolution.  </s>
<s> Thx, Ben  </s>
<s> Since we have not heard otherwise, we are assuming that you have no objections to our resolution.  </s>
<s> Thx, Ben  </s>
