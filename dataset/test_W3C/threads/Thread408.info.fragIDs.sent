<s> Hi. I'm looking at implementing SAX support into JTidy.  </s>
<s> Would you be  </s>
<s> willing to act as an alpha site/consultant while I'm implementing this?  </s>
<s> I haven't used SAX much myself but I am generally familiar with it and I've reviewed Dave Megginson's site in a fair amount of detail.  </s>
<s> I'm looking at implementing the XMLReader interface and initially driving just ContentHandler and ErrorHandler methods for now.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the question.  </s>
<s> Hope you can help.  </s>
