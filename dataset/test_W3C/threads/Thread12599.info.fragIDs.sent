<s> EOWG: A reminder that the SVG access note is under review: We've only gotten a few EOWG comments on it so far; ideally we should have at least four or five EOWG members give it a serious read-through.  </s>
<s> If you are planning to review and comment on it, could you please reply to this message on the EOWG mailing list so we know how much additional review the note will be getting?  </s>
<s> (If you're not going to review it -- and not everyone has fun reading detailed technical documents, which is fine -- please do _not_ reply to this message.)

<s> These comments in refer to Accessibility Features of SVG, W3C Note 7 August 2000 [ http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SVG-access-20000807/ ] Editorial comment: In section 1.1, might the sentence: "The working context of people with (or without) disabilities can vary enormously."  </s>
<s> be better stated as "The working context of people (with or without disabilities) varies enormously."  </s>
<s> In section 1.2, in the paragraph under the heading "Alternative Equivalents", the second sentence needs the word "allows" inserted between "SVG" and "authors".  </s>
<s> In example 2.2, is the first /g supposed to be there?  </s>
<s> Isn't that a stray end-tag?  </s>
<s> General comments: I would appreciate a concise list of the accessibility features of SVG in the introductory section (perhaps with links to the subsequent examples of use).  </s>
<s> Such a list could be more easily extracted into a one-page handout or presentation slide.  </s>
<s> I think I recall someone (possibly William) commenting that this note could well be split into two documents: a features overview and a user-guide for accessible SVG design.  </s>
<s> As I got deeper and deeper into it, and the code examples grew longer and longer, I began to agree.  </s>
<s> Having read the first three sections fairly carefully and having skimmed the remainder, I am now all excited about SVG.  </s>
<s> I have been talking-up the promise of SVG for some time now, and have been very lucky that people just stared at me blankly and didn't ask any questions about it.  </s>
<s> I am happy that I can now answer some questions if and when they get asked, except of course, for the big one: when will it matter?  </s>

<s> Hi Judy, I read the note on accessibility of SVG.  </s>
<s> I think Charles and Marja made a good job.  </s>
<s> As someone else pointed out (sorry I did not keep that email), the document looks like a mixture of a tutorial with comments about accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> I found the tutorial really useful (specially on the use of style-sheets), but I am wondering whether it would not be better to split the document in two: an accessibility note, and a "techniques"-note like WCAG.  </s>
<s> I tried the examples on the latest release of Mozilla, which allegedly supports the 99 draft of SVG, without success.  </s>
<s> In regard to Amaya, I have version 2.4, and there is no support, although I thought it had some support.  </s>
<s> I will upgrade as soon as I can.  </s>
