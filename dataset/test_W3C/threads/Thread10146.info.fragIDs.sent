<s> I guess I wasn't clear.  </s>
<s> Yes, the MT allows something to be both a class and a property.  </s>
<s> I don't mind that.  </s>
<s> But it doesn't *require* anything to be both a class and a property.  </s>
<s> So in SWAD, we generally consider it a mistake if you make something both a class and a property.  </s>
<s> And we'd rather not have that sort of heuristic flat out contradicted by the specs, e.g. if the spec said that dt:date was a class while we use it as a property.  </s>

<s> Er... it was also felt that confusing the value space with the mapping is unnecessarily confusing; I'm not sure if that's part of the discussion you're talking about, since you don't give a citation, but it is a matter of record:  </s>

<s> Which notion, exactly?  </s>
<s> I see two: (a) the RDF specs don't guarantee that classes are disjoint from properties (b) the RDF specs guarantee that classes and properties intersect.  </s>
<s> (a) has been around for a while; (b) has been with us only since 6 Sep.  </s>
<s> Even in situation (a), some folks can advocate "keep your properties separate from your classes" as a best practice (sorta like ala # vs /) while the spec remains silent on the issue.  </s>
<s> With the WG proposing (b), it forces those of us who advocate keeping properties and classes separate to object.  </s>
<s> I don't think (b) has found general acceptance.  </s>
<s> It hasn't found acceptance among the developers I work with.  </s>
<s> Well, perhaps it's not worth re-opening the issue at this point; we're clearly not going to make everybody happy with any datatypes design.  </s>
<s> But I couldn't let your "everybody thinks this is just fine" go unqualified.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get this design thru last call without objections from the folks I work with.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> Have your colleagues considered how the lint program might be adapted to cope with some exceptions where classes and properties are not disjoint, e.g. don't issue the warning when its a datatype property?  </s>
<s> Possible define a class of properties which are also classes and define datatype properties to be a subclass of that.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Dan, It is my recollection that the idea of datatype URIs being both classes and properties has been floating around for some time [*], and this is the first time I've been aware of dissent with it (not counting the message to rdf-logic as a record of dissent).  </s>
<s> I think datatype as class and properties represent current WG thinking, so if there is a problem with this I think we should hear what that problem is.  </s>
<s> [*] a recent reference is: and from the datatyping draft that was agreed would be the basis for work going forward: 4.

<s> This section assumes familiarity with these basic concepts.  </s>
<s> Suppose I is an RDF interpretation of a graph E. Then I is datatyped (with respect to a set D of datatypes) if the following is true for any datatype URI Reference ddd (with I(ddd) in D): (1) ICEXT(I(ddd)) = {x : x,y in IEXT(I(ddd))} I.e. the class extension of the datatype class is the value space of the datatype.  </s>
<s> (2) For any typed literal ddd"LLL", I(ddd"LLL") = L2V(I(ddd))("LLL") I.e. the typed literal node denotes the datatype value having the lexical representation "LLL" according to the lexical to value mapping defined for the datatype ddd Condition (1) is quite explicit about this.  </s>
