<s> Checkpoint 10.2 - Until user agents support explicit associations between labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned New Technique: currently, ask I created: Technique 10.2.1 [priority 2] Verify that label controls are properly positioned.  </s>
<s> Refer also to checkpoint 12.4 Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation: Triggered by the following elements: INPUT LABEL LEGEND?? SELECT TEXTAREA Example Language: A label for a text area, a text input control or group of controls (e.g., a group of checkboxes) must immediately precede its control (or group of controls) on the same line (if there is only one control or group) or be in the line preceding the control (or group of controls).  </s>

<s> I could go either way on this, but we might not need to trigger on LABEL.  </s>
<s> Reason being, the LABEL only has meaning if there is an INPUT, SELECT, or TEXTAREA which will already have triggered this.  </s>
<s> Also, if there is a LABEL, we know to which form control it applies and therefore whether it's positioned properly, making that an automatic check.  </s>
<s> LEGEND is an interesting one, I hadn't thought of it before.  </s>
<s> I don't think of FIELDSET as a form control although technically it is, I think of it as a grouping mechanism and thus excluded from this need.  </s>
<s> Also, that appeared at the same time as LABEL so a browser that supports one will probably support the other.  </s>
<s> However, I suppose it does effectively label a group of controls (as opposed to labelling a FIELDSET which is what it actually does) and thus should be included here.  </s>
<s> But the proper placement of LEGEND would be before any other form controls located inside the FIELDSET, which we could detect automatically.  </s>
<s> So in summary, I ask whether or not to trigger on LABEL and LEGEND, and if yes, I propose to present them as a separate Technique which is considered fully automatable.  </s>

<s> Suggestion: labels for radio buttons and checkboxes appear after labels for text fields appear in front.  </s>
<s> Putting labels for radio buttons and checkboxes first may seem inconsistent, but it's needed for reasonable visual rendering, it's the most common, and it's more important to stay with what a blind user expects than to change it in just a few places.  </s>
<s> Thus, I propose the following language for the repair technique: Repair Technique:Allow the user to reposition labels associated with form controls as follows: Labels for radio buttons and checkboxes should appear after the radio button or checkbox.  </s>
<s> For example: [checkbox] oranges, [checkbox] apples.  </s>
<s> If the radio buttons or checkboxes are horizontal rather than vertical put the labels on one line and the form controls on the next.  </s>
<s> For example: apples oranges pears [checkbox] [checkbox] [checkbox]  </s>
<s> Labels for text fields appear before the text field.  </s>
<s> For example: last name [text area].  </s>
<s> Labels for groups of any form control should appear before the group.  </s>
<s> For example: choose a city [radio button] Boston [radio button] Madison.  </s>

<s> checkbox checkbox" you could make it look like the checkboxes on one line and the labels beneath and have it read checkbox apples checkbox oranges checkbox pears just like they were each on a separate line, if each label and checkbox pair are in a cell of a one row table, with a BR between each checkbox and label, i.e. TD oranges BR [checkbox] TD apples BR [checkbox] TD pears BR [checkbox] For simplicity, I've omitted the actual checkbox markup as well as the Len Leonard R.
