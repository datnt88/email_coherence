<s> The lexical space is the set of all Unicode strings which: * are well-balanced, self-contained XML data [XML]; * when encoded using UTF-8 yield exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ) [XML-XC14N]; It occurs to me that the source of confusion may be:  </s>
<s> The lexical-to-value mapping maps a string to the corresponding exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ).  </s>
<s> when, now that the canonicalization is handled by the parser, all we really need to say is: The lexical-to-value mapping is UTF-8 encoding of the lexical form (yielding an octet sequence) It which case, the lexical space description might be: The lexical space is the set of all Unicode strings which are mapped by the lexical-to-value mapping to exclusive canonical XML (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ) [XML-XC14N]; But hang on, we already have:  </s>
<s> The value space is the set of all exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ), which when embedded within an arbitrary XML start tag and an end tag form a document conforming to XML Namespaces [XML-NS].  </s>

<s> UTF-8 encoding to valid XMNL literal values (see below) Putting it all together, and polishing a little, my suggestion is: The lexical space is the set of Unicode strings which are mapped by UTF-8 encoding to valid XML literal values (see below) The lexical-to-value mapping is UTF-8 encoding (yielding an octet sequence, where octets are distinct from characters) The value space is the set of all exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ), which when embedded within an arbitrary XML start tag and an end tag form a document conforming to XML Namespaces [XML-NS].  </s>

<s> We have already canonicalized the lexical forms about as strongly as the combined forces of XML and RDF are able to canonicalize them; the operational point of doing this is so that an RDF engine can compare equality of literal values by comparing identity of lexical form, and we don't have to have special inference rules which substitute different but co-referring XML forms one for another in all possible ways.  </s>
