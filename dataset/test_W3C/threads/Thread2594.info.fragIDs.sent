<s> Hi all, Looking at the definition of Chunked tranfer coding  </s>
<s> in draft-ietf-http-v11-rev-06.txt (section 3.6.1),  </s>
<s> one reads: "The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of the chunk."  </s>
<s> Shouldn't this read "the size of the chunk-data"?  </s>
<s> The chunk itself is defined as chunk = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF chunk-data CRLF However, looking at how Web servers (Apache, IIS) implement chunked transfer coding, it realy looks like chunk-size represents the size of the chunk-data itself... Am I missing something?  </s>
<s> Thanks for any clarification,  </s>

<s> If there's no objection, we'll try to make this correction as the RFC Editor processes the document.  </s>

<s> That should be possible.  </s>
<s> Just pass detailed editorial notes to the RFC editor, and I am sure they can handle this -- hopefully.  </s>
