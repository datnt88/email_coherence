<s> Hi again, I have been using amaya to edit CSS for a while now and have always had this problem.  </s>
<s> When I save the css document the editor scrolls to the top of the document, which makes me have to scroll back down a couple of pages after I've looked at any changes in the webpage, to return to where I was editing in the css file.  </s>
<s> This happens whenever I'm editing a css which is long enough to be scrollable across about 2 or more pages.  </s>
<s> I'm currently using Amaya 8.3 for Windows Xp, however I remember this artifact from 8.2 as well.  </s>

<s> When you save the CSS file, Amaya reparses this CSS file and recomputes the CSS cascade for all open documents that link this CSS.  </s>
<s> This explains why other documents are reformatted and redisplayed.  </s>
<s> Why Amaya should do is to register the current position of the displayed document and to scroll automatically to that position when the document is redisplayed.  </s>

<s> Yes, I think this is a good idea.  </s>
<s> That happens when I hit the Reload button.  </s>
<s> Oh, and I also have this suggestion: It seems hitting the Reload button causes the css editor to: 1. Reload the document (obviously ;) 2. Colorize any new /**/ comments.  </s>
<s> 3. Scroll to the position where I was editing.  </s>
<s> I think that it would be great if points 2 and three would happen also when I save it!  </s>
<s> Another suggestion (this is a quite luxurious dream-feature ;): It would be really cool to be able to 'Contract' and 'Expand' multi-line style definitions in the CSS editor, kind of the thing Mozilla does with XML documents and some code editors can do with, for example, different methods.  </s>
<s> Illustration: - div.VMenu A { Color: Black; Background-color: White; Would when i click the Minus become (perhaps with an alternate color for easy spotting): + div.VMenu  </s>
<s> A Note: This would only be a visual presentation and should not alter the document buffer.  </s>
<s> Also (this is the last one, promise ;): Wouldn't it be great to have the Tab key add, say, two spaces right before the current insertion point (when editing Source code of Webdocuments and CSS) ?  </s>
<s> Regards Thomas.  </s>
