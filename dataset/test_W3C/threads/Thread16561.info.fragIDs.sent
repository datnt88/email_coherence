<s> I'm writing to ask whether folks have experience with the Adobe Systems pdf-to-html converter (found at Specifically, did folks find it useful for assessing compliance with Section 508 proposed standards for web accessibility.  </s>
<s> What is your opinion is as to how accessible the end product is to users with screen readers or other assistive technologies?  </s>
<s> The web master at the Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports the following: "I decided to really give the converter a rough test, so I sent one of BTS's more layout-intensive pdfs, the Pocket Guide to Transportation (http://www.bts.gov/pg.pdf).  </s>
<s> I wasn't entirely displeased with the way the converter handled paragraphs of text, but, as I suspected, tables and certain figures were a problem.  </s>
<s> The converter also seemed to rearrange large chunks of information so that they were in a different order in the html document."  </s>
<s> "I'm sure the usefulness of the converter is largely dependent on the layout of individual pdfs, but I'm looking for any overall suggestions or cautions you can give me.  </s>
<s> We want to make sure the work we do on converting pdf formats to html is thorough, but we also want to make sure that the converter is the best place to start."  </s>

<s> WL: There are two (at least) things: conversion success is almost totally dependent on original designer's attention to issues (frequently this is mostly total unawareness of the issue); anything short of  </s>
<s> initial attention renders a result, even a "converted" version, with a result having a frustration index (FI) of about 11 on a scale of 10. Keep in mind that the trivial part (straight text conversion) is a very minor part and that in the instant case (schedules, etc. - table intensive info) the information about the layout started *and remained* visual in concept.  </s>
<s> The original designers, being usually blindless, weren't even aware that the tables were merely a means of representing data for easy visual access - oblivious to other access means.  </s>
<s> It's built in to the "sighted culture" and to date efforts to mend the inherent attitude are fairly futile.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> [DJW:] That's true for a completely automated tool, but if this tool is completely automated, its real aim is probably to get round blacklisting of PDF, as anything it does could, in principle, be done in an accessibility enhanced Acrobat reader.  </s>
