<s> Hi! I'd like to thank everyone of the W3C staff who answered our questions during the last weeks.  </s>
<s> Since all questions concerning the copyright of a translation have been answered positively, we will now begin with our translation of XML 1.0 into German.  </s>
<s> If all works fine we will publish a first version within the next week; unfortunately we cannot attend the XML conference :-| But when you return from Seattle you will probably find a German XML translation on the web :-) We have already an URL for the translation: At the moment there's nothing valuable; just an announce...

<s> BTW: Is there already a page for XML translations at the W3C site?  </s>
<s> (I just know about a page for HTML 4 translations)  </s>

<s> Hello Stefan, Very glad to hear that you started the XML translation.  </s>
<s> I just had a look at your page at  </s>
<s> There is one problem that has been brought up to W3C staff before, and that may come up again, so I think it is worth discussing it here in the list.  </s>
<s> There is no such thing as an "official" translation of HTML or whatever into language X.  </s>
<s> The W3C does not have the manpower and language expertise to do the checks that would be necessary to give some translation a kind of "official" status.  </s>
<s> The only thing the W3C can do and does is to reserve the right to require corrections or removal of a translation if errors become apparent (see the FAQ at In principle, it is possible to have two translations of the same document into the same language.  </s>
<s> Of course, this is a waste of time,  </s>
<s> and we try to avoid this by providing this list and the respective pages.  </s>
<s> In this connection, the use of the definite article (in languages where this is possible) is also a bit questionable, but as long as there is only one translation, to say that this is *the* translation into a given language is factually true.  </s>
<s> I have initiated that we get one.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry, Martin, I have fixed this on my pages immediately.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I can change it back to "official", if there should be a decision about an "official" translation in the future.  </s>
