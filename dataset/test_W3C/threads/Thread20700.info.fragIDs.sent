<s> Hi, everyone.  </s>
<s> I'm new to the list and new to Amaya.  </s>
<s> It looks like it is  </s>
<s> going to become my primary writing tool.  </s>
<s> I like the interface.  </s>
<s> Problem:  </s>
<s> When I attempt to print from Amaya 5.1 on a Win98 system, I get the following messages: Error- Source: PrintDoc (4) then either I get the Windows "program has performed an illegal  </s>
<s> operation and will be shut down" dialog or sometimes the blue screen of  </s>
<s> death "Fatal exception has 0A has occurred at 0147:00008831..." or Amaya  </s>
<s> crashes without any notification.  </s>
<s> Sometimes the material is sent to the printer and prints okay.  </s>
<s> At other  </s>
<s> times only part of the material prints.  </s>
<s> Sometimes I get multiple copies  </s>
<s> and the printer spool talks of printing "page 57 of 2 pages," etc.  </s>
<s> I have scanned the archives back to January for every report of printer  </s>
<s> problems or crashes I could find without seeing anything like this.  </s>
<s> Is  </s>
<s> there a fix that I've missed?  </s>
<s> Is this a known problem?  </s>
<s> If it is  </s>
<s> something new, is there anything I can do to help identify it better?  </s>

<s> Hello Will,  </s>
<s> Does your printing problem occurs with some specific documents or is it  </s>
<s> general?  </s>
<s> If it concerns certain documents only, could you send us one of them.  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Since I also work with Amaya 5.1 under Win98, I've made a test with my  </s>
<s> document It was printed and I got no error message.  </s>
<s> However, the two pictures that that page contains came out as two totally dark rectangules, and this happened with two different printers.  </s>

<s> other  </s>
<s> copies  </s>
<s> printer  </s>
<s> Is  </s>
<s> better?  </s>
<s> it  </s>
<s> The problem is general and consistently repeatable with documents from different sources.  </s>
<s> Two that would be easy to replicate: printing the product of the "make book" command on Manual.html has repeatedly failed when Amaya reports printing page 64 and it also leaves the spool messed  </s>
<s> up; printing AmayaPage.html  </s>
<s> (the default home page) also fails.  </s>
<s> And this just failed: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"  </s>
<s> "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; It printed okay, but that instance of Amaya spontaneously vaporized,  </s>
<s> leaving no trace of itself even in the task list.  </s>
<s> I just realized I haven't yet tried removing an re-installing Amaya.  </s>
<s> I'll do so later this morning and see if that helps.  </s>
<s> (rusty with this kind of thing-- many years since I've done much configuration work!) Will  </s>
<s> PS-- I'm sending this to both the list and the originator.  </s>
<s> Is that the  </s>
<s> group's preference, or would it be better to just send replies to the  </s>
<s> list?  </s>
<s> There is effectively a bug with the print command under Windows.  </s>
<s> We'll try to fix it as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your report.  </s>
<s> Good question.  </s>
<s> I don't know is there is such a 'protocol' in that mailing-list.  </s>
