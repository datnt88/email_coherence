<s> Since no-one posted in response to my previous report: Installed the new release 1.3 System Linux 2.0.29 PPro 32Mb Amaya starts up as far as making its top panel and then freezes.  </s>
<s> No buttons then respond.  </s>
<s> It can be killed from the window manager using "destroy".  </s>
<s> ... Perhaps someone could at least give us some information about the linux version, motif, etc that the 1.3 binary was created with.  </s>
<s> Then perhaps it might be possible to guess what to try next.  </s>
<s> I have now established that 1.3 does the same freezing problem on two machines, RedHat versions 4.1 and 4.2, Xfree86 3.3.1.  </s>
<s> No way am I going to start randomly installing new libraries on a stable system in case that might solve the problem.  </s>
<s> No I don't have motif, otherwise I would try to compile it myself.  </s>
<s> (Actually I did try, but only got as far as ./configure  </s>
<s> telling me I did not have motif -- which I know already -- and so my knowing that amaya needs it.)  </s>
<s> More information might be really helpful, folks!  </s>

<s> Hello, There was a problem with the Amaya binary distribution for linux.  </s>
<s> We recompiled the code today in another linux box and this seems to have fixed the freeze problems that were reported in the list.  </s>
<s> You can find the distribution as usual at: Thanks for your useful feedback and your patience, -Jose, on behalf of the Amaya team Jose Kahan | w3c/INRIA | The taste W3C technical support team | ZIRST | of rain [http://www.w3.org] | 655, avenue de l'Europe | -Why kneel?  </s>
