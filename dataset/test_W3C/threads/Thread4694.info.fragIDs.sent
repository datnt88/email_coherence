<s> Hello, at VLDB in Berlin, Michael Rys convinced me to send another email to the XQuery comment list.  </s>
<s> Since I don't expect my email to have any influence, I don't bother writing down all points of XQuery which I think should be corrected.  </s>
<s> Instead I concentrate on the points I think are really bad.  </s>
<s> Here they are: 1) Runtime Exceptions: A query language should not have runtime exceptions.  </s>
<s> This may not always be achievable but at least type-errors should all be discovered at compilation time.  </s>
<s> This is not true for XQuery.  </s>
<s> 2) A query language should be deterministic.  </s>
<s> This is not true for XQuery.  </s>
<s> Essentially, these are the points why I write this email.  </s>
<s> Here is my motivating scenario: In XQuery, "p and q" and "q and p" may give a different result due to runtime exceptions.  </s>
<s> Why is this bad?  </s>
<s> Assume the following scenario: A big company developes a web-site based on millions of XML documents.  </s>
<s> In all these documents XQueries are embedded to give dynamic up-to-date information.  </s>
<s> Millions of the queries embedded in the documents use conjunctions and after thorough testing all queries work and the web site is put into operation.  </s>
<s> After several years, the XML document base grows and queries slow down.  </s>
<s> The sysadmin decides to gather new statistics and let the queries be reoptimized.  </s>
<s> The query optimizer decides that changing the order of conjunctions will result in better plans for about half a million queries.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, due to the indeterminism, all queries crash.  </s>
<s> The web site is down for about three month, costing the company millions of dollars(!).  </s>
<s> What could be your answer?  </s>
<s> -- The programmers should have used cascading "if-then-else" expressions.  </s>
<s> NO! for two reasons: 1) It could well be that they are not aware of the complications involved with using "and" and "or" and runtime exceptions.  </s>
<s> (Remember that testing went all o.k.) 2) Using cascading "if-then-else" averts any query optimization.  </s>
<s> The query is not declarative any more.  </s>
<s> Now, what should be done to correct XQuery?  </s>
<s> Many things: 1) introduce NULL-values and three valued logic (Remember that OQL had the same design flaw as XQuery---although not that bad---and that they introduced NULL-values in later versions after having tried to correct things by introducing "andthen" and "orelse" (similar to "if-then-else").) 2) Don't let empty sequences partially play the role of NULL-values.  </s>
<s> (Remember: is_null(empty-sequence) is not true is_empty(NULL) is not true) These things are too different to be identified.  </s>
<s> 3) Do not identify single items with singleton-sequences that contain that single item.  </s>
<s> Even in the most flexible type systems of real and used programming/query languages they are distinguished.  </s>
<s> Other points I don't like are: 1) too much implicit casting 2) no explicit grouping (grouping has to be expressed by nested queries.  </s>
<s> these are difficult to unnest.  </s>
<s> unnesting is not always possible and is an error-prone process due to its complexity.)  </s>
<s> This is also a mistake that was made by the OQL designers.  </s>
<s> (Not exactly the same, since they have an explicit grouping, but a nested query had to be used to work on the "partition" attribute.  </s>
<s> They subsequently corrected things half-way by introducing some syntactic sugar for common cases.  </s>
<s> But you wouldn't call that a perfect solution nor would you call it elegant.) best guido ps: although XQuery improved, some of the points of my first email are still valid.  </s>
<s> Just a nitpick: SQL WHERE clauses fail with a conversion error if a conversion fails and the query processor executes a plan that leads to the execution of the offending conversion.  </s>
<s> Actually, the current XQuery rules are pretty close to SQL's rules in that respect.  </s>

<s> On Behalf Of Bill Keese Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2003 7:11 PM Subject: Re: XQuery Guido, you suggested that null values be introduced into XQuery, and  </s>
<s> met  </s>
<s> with a lot of opposition.  </s>
<s> But, from your examples, it seems like what you really wanted was something like "use null semantics when  </s>
<s> evaluating  </s>
<s> where conditions".  </s>
<s> You don't actually want an XQuery expression to return null values, do you?  </s>
<s> What if where clauses operated like SQL where clauses, returning false when there was a type conversion exception?  </s>
<s> I guess this is pretty much what Michael Kay suggested.  </s>
<s> (Of  </s>
<s> course, the counter-argument is that type-exception messages help programmers catch errors in their code and their data.  </s>
<s> I understand both views.)  </s>
<s> for $p in document("p.xml")//person  </s>
<s> where is_null((number) $p/@age) /* not exactly XQuery syntax,  </s>
<s> sorry  </s>
<s> return $p/@name  </s>
<s> You can write this query using the "instance of" operator, right?  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#id-instance-of) for $p in document("p.xml")//person  </s>
<s> where not($p/@age instance of xs:number) /* I think this is xquery  </s>
<s> syntax  </s>
<s> return $p/@name  </s>
<s> Indeterminism sucks!  </s>
<s> By the way, I don't think anyone was really debating your argument  </s>
<s> that  </s>
<s> non-deterministic languages have serious disadvantages.  </s>
<s> Basically, if  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> was to paraphrase all the responses, I would say that  </s>
<s> "non-deterministic  </s>
<s> languages have many problems, but we can't make XQuery deterministic because the performance would be unacceptably bad".  </s>
<s> Bill Keese PS: it took me a while to figure out that existentialism has nothing  </s>
<s> to  </s>
<s> do with Kafka.  </s>
<s> (Especially since every Kafka book's main character is named "K", which is pronounced the same as "Kay"...)  </s>
<s> Wow, I've been away from SQL too long, I had forgotten this.  </s>
<s> I had a dim memory that SQL is also non-deterministic; you might cause/avoid hitting an exception, for example, by creating an index on a certain column.  </s>
<s> Well, if XQuery is working like SQL then at least it's something that's been proven by experience.  </s>
<s> Basically, it seems like - a (non-null) column value in a relational table (accessed via SQL) corresponds to a sequence in an XML document (accessed via XQuery) (ie, a list of values rather than just a single value) - a NULL value in a relational table (accessed via SQL) corresponds to an empty sequence.  </s>
<s> (ie, a list of no values) Other than that SQL and XQuery are "the same", so to speak.  </s>
