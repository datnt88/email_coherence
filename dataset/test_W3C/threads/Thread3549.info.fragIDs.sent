<s> In addition, there may be more than one service involved in the message exchange.  </s>
<s> And there may be different requester, who consumes the message, who may expect different locale and language.  </s>
<s> Message exchange in components with different language and/or locales may result a failure or unexpected result.  </s>
<s> This section describes various message exchange patterns that need consideration or that have potential failure scenarios.  </s>

<s> Using non-internationalized Data Structures A data structure may be provided without international considerations.  </s>
<s> This may happen, for instance, when a service was originally designed and targeted for a specific local market and later adopted to a global Web service.  </s>
<s> This is an example of my daily activity provided in Japanese 12 hour time scheme.  </s>
<s> Example: My schedule Time : To do GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast GOGO 0:00 : Lunch GOGO 7:00 : Dinner GOZEN 0:00 : Go to bed GOZEN means "before noon", and generally corresponds to AM. GOGO means "after noon", and generally corresponds to PM. The problem is GOGO 0:00 is noon rather than 0:00 AM, and GOZEN 0:00 is midnight rather than 0:00 PM.  </s>
<s> This is confusing and conversion to internationally known time format may fail.  </s>
<s> Thank you  </s>
<s> Hi, Good example.  </s>
<s> Note that translating Gozen and Gogo to AM and PM works out ok, but the 0:00 needs to convert to 12:00.  </s>
<s> Same confusion apparently exists in English, see excerpts from Heritage dictionary below.  </s>

<s> Usage Note: By definition, 12 A.M. denotes midnight, and 12 P.M. denotes noon, but there is sufficient confusion over the meanings of A.M. and P.M. when the hour is 12 to make it advisable to use 12 noon and 12 midnight where clarity is required.  </s>
