<s> Two narrow, technical questions: (a) if my base language is EN-US but I have proper names in other languages, should I use SPAN LANG="xx" Foreign Name /SPAN to be in compliance with the WAI content recommendation?  </s>
<s> I have been working under the assumption that I should use LANG where a foreign word would be italicized under print conventions (i.e., non-proper foreign words, but not proper nouns).  </s>
<s> However, a voice browser is going to mangle a name just as badly as a non-proper foreign word.  </s>
<s> But if I do use LANG on proper names, I could be flipping among languages multiple times per sentence, or even per name (for example SPAN LANG="FR" Marie /SPAN SPAN LANG="IT" de'Medici /SPAN , SPAN LANG="NL" Maurits /SPAN of SPAN LANG="DE" Nassau /SPAN ).  </s>
<s> If voice user agents announce the change in language every time this happens, or change the voice used to speak the words, I imagine it could be very annoying to users, perhaps even more annoying than mangled names.  </s>
<s> I understand that, given the lack of support for LANG in current technology, this is a somewhat abstract question.  </s>
<s> Still I would like to be prepared for the future and in compliance with the standard in the present.  </s>
<s> (b) if I include roman numerals in my text, will commonly used voice  </s>
<s> browsers/screen readers read them as the associated number or as the component letters?  </s>
<s> For example would a listener hear "Bogislav XIV" as "Bogislav the Fourteenth" or as "Bogislav EX-EYE-VEE"?  </s>
<s> Is there any difference in reading among: Bogislav XIV Bogislav XIVth Bogislav XIVth.  </s>
<s> If this is a problem, is there any solution other than writing out the numeral or using arabic numerals (both of which would confuse or annoy users of visual browsers)?  </s>
<s> Would SPAN TITLE="the Fourteenth" do anybody any good?  </s>
<s> Or even ACRONYM TITLE="the Fourteenth" ?  </s>
<s> (Yes, ABBR is actually correct, but I'm not even going to go there.) I know this is a little off-topic for a policy making list, so if there is a proper list of which I am unaware, I would be grateful if you could forward this there.  </s>

<s> reads Bogislav XIV as "Bogislav ZIV" Ivan IV is Ivan Eye Vee in the past, when i have had to encode roman numerals, i have done so using something similar to: George ABBR title="the Second" lang="la" II /ABBR or George ABBR lang="la" title="the Third" III /ABBR  </s>
<s> but, with the state of today's technology, i still hear "George Two" and "George Three", as JFW does interpret double capital eyes as "two", and triple capital eyes as "three", but that's the extent of it's knowledge of roman numerals...  </s>

<s> (Yes, ABBR is actually correct, but I'm not even going to go there.) unquote for those using Graphical User Agents that expose titles as ToolTips, the supplemental information should be exposed when a user mouses-over the titled element... and, when screen reader manufacturers allow users to pick and choose what sort of information they want exposed when reading web based documents, it will definitely help those speech users who care to avail themselves of the functionality... i know i will, gregory.  </s>

<s> Just as a footnote, if someone really wanted Roman numerals spoken correctly it would be what the math books like to call a "trivial exercise" (i.e., conceptually easy but tedious) to define entries for most of them in the screen-reader's pronunciation dictionary.  </s>
<s> Thus "XIV" = "fourteen", "LXIII" = "sixty-three" etc.  </s>
<s> The system would break down though for single Roman numerals, since no screen reader alive can figure out if the I in "After Leopold I came to power" is a pronoun or a numeral.  </s>
<s> ... So the markup could be handy if implemented.  </s>
