<s> I question whether it's appropriate for DOM to define as many virtual keys as it already does.  </s>
<s> Many of these keys are very device- or platform-specific.  </s>
<s> Also, you mention Unicode, which seems orthogonal to the discussion of virtual key codes.  </s>
<s> Aren't VK_ codes intended for key events and not character events?  </s>
<s> For example, there are not separate VK codes for '3' and '#' because they occupy the same key on the qwerty keyboard.  </s>

<s> Keycodes are device specific in any case so relying on them for keydown/keyup would be inappropriate imho.  </s>

<s> The specification is unclear however on which character should be generated, i.e. with or without the modifier:  </s>
<s> - A generates a 'a' on keydown/up, shift+A generates 'A'.  </s>
<s> - 3 generates a 'a' on keydown/up, shift+3 generates '3' (and not '#').  </s>

<s> In my opinion, the only sensible way, is that always the generated character would be generated.  </s>

<s> I think it's important that the users' locales are abstracted sufficiently so that we don't have to think, "ah yes, shift+3 is a currency symbol, so that's OK"  </s>
<s> In turn, this suggests to me that the best method is to return the (Unicode) character -- which a few virtual keys left over for non printing keys (for example, cursor, f-keys, esc, etc.)  </s>

<s> - A generates a 'A' (and not 'a') on keydown/up, shift+A generates 'A'.  </s>

<s> Agree.  </s>
<s> This was indeed the intent: virtual keys are for keys without unicode character representation.  </s>
<s> If we reintroduce the keyCode, it will be possible again to rely on the device specific layout btw, but we'll make clear in the specification that its use should be avoided as much as possible.  </s>

<s> From: Philippe Le Hegaret [mailto:plh@w3.org]  </s>
<s> So use of keyDown/keyUp should be discouraged for every key except VK_ keys, which should have no unicode equivalent.  </s>
<s> One might justifiably use keyDown/keyUp of the 'A' key in a game, for example, just as one might use the left arrow key -- as an on/off switch rather than as a means of text input.  </s>
<s> In that case, there should be some definition of what code will be in the keyCode ('a' or 'A').  </s>
<s> Platforms generally have conventions for that.  </s>
<s> DOM should recognize that if it is going to specify virtual key codes and key events.  </s>
<s> --Brad Pettit  </s>
<s> Yes. The question is whether to try to do something that includes a wide range of keys on a lot of keyboards, or something that only includes the keys on most keyboards.  </s>
<s> My tendency is for the former, with the clear addition that a DOM implementation is only required to support equivalents for those keys that are actually present.  </s>
<s> "On some querty keyboards" is probably slightly more precise.  </s>
