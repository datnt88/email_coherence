<s> I want to make sure that I had adequate coverage of parsers for the test review matrix.  </s>
<s> Java: In the past, I've run the tests (or the earlier Domunit test) on: Xerces-J 1, Xerces-J 2, Crimson, DOM4J, Oracle-J, Batik (making allowances for SVG-specificity).  </s>
<s> Probably should add GNUJAXP, any others.  </s>
<s> ECMAScript: Mozilla 0.9.+, MSXML 3.0, Adobe SVG Viewer (again making SVG allowances).  </s>
<s> Do Amaya, Konquerer, or others support XML DOM?  </s>
<s> .NET: Would love to have System.Xml from Microsoft's .NET in the matrix, but I haven't been able to spend any time with it.  </s>
<s> Python: Any progress on a Python binding, Fred?  </s>
<s> If you could transliterate even a few of the generated Java tests and get them running under PyUnit, I should be able to get the test-to-py transform done pretty quickly.  </s>
<s> C++: I've run Domunit with Xerces-C, but I haven't done C++ support for the DOM TS yet.  </s>
<s> I've never used libxml but it definitely should be supported by the suite.  </s>
<s> Konqueror does, as does Opera (though no methods to insert nodes into the document tree are supported).  </s>
<s> Amaya does not support ECMAScript ( -Dylan Schiemann Do You Yahoo!? Make a great connection at Yahoo! Personals.  </s>
<s> FWIW, I read http://www.opera.com/opera4/specs.html#xml as saying that Opera has very limited HTML DOM support, but never mentions XML DOM support.  </s>
<s> In any event, they do say: "We support the following attributes [sic, "methods" ???] in the document object: getElementsByTagName() getElementById() getElementByName() " That's pretty minimal!  </s>
<s> Dunno if you want to hear about partials... Xalan supports partial DOM bindings to its (non-DOM) internal data models in the Java version, and I believe in the C++ version.  </s>
<s> Should be close to complete for core read operations, but no mutation is permitted.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> The primary motivation was to find enough distinct implementations that think they are complete and spec conformant to find any holes in the tests.  </s>
<s> It should be pretty simple to produce a test suite that is only read-only cases (since load has a willBeModified attribute to allow reuse of documents in ECMAScript testing).  </s>
<s> Does Xalan-J's DOM support JAXP?  </s>
<s> If not, then a JAXP adapter would need to be added to the DOM test support files.  </s>
