<s> I've done a pass through the whole document.  </s>
<s> There is now some purple text to indicate technical issues, though not a lot and quite a lot more green text.  </s>

<s> Hi Brian  </s>
<s> I just wanted to pick up on the purple bits - all mine.  </s>
<s> 1: URI Ref The URI Ref section is a mess - I tried to fix it and failed and reverted to the previously published version that you've dissected.  </s>
<s> For this publication, in your opinion, would it suffice to note that this section is currently inadequate in the detail but captures the main intent; or would you like me to have another go at making sense of it.  </s>
<s> 2: predicate *RDF* URI Reference accept 3: Graph Equality largely reject - change to Two RDF graphs are equal if and only if they are isomorphic, as follows.  </s>
<s> rationale: - your term Graph Equality Isomorphism is ugly.  </s>
<s> - standard usage is that XXX isomorphism preserves the structure of XXX. thus an RDF Graph isomorphism preserves the structure of an RDF Graph.  </s>
<s> This standard usage (largely) depends on a defn of an XXX isomorphism for each XXX.  </s>
<s> "respects" has a well-established meaning when discussing isomorphisms and does not further clarification.  </s>
<s> FYI it indicates that the structure is unaffected by the bijection.  </s>
<s> If i is the isomorphism then i respects arc labels if and only if for any arc a and any label l, l labels a = l labels i(a).  </s>
<s> 4: Charmod (Not sure why this is purple ... I suppose this will be a substantive change at last call).  </s>
<s> As it says in the doc, Charmod is currently in last call, and, upon examination of the I18N web site appears to be stalled awaiting advancement of IRI-draft, which appears to be stalled since its author is too busy in IRI-advocacy mode on the tag!  </s>
<s> I am intending to formally propose the deletion of this para straight after this publication.  </s>
<s> I feel that it is better to leave it in now so that when we get last call comments from I18N about what happened to thbe early uniform normalization (that is mentioned in M&amp;S) we point to this WD.  </s>
<s> The failure of the I18N people to advance charmod really leaves us little choice here.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> PS Didn't you have any comments on the changelog?  </s>
<s> I think it can go as is for now.  </s>
<s> I think that deals with with the 'not all isomorphisms will do' comment.  </s>
<s> Should be a colon on the end of that though.  </s>
<s> raised eyebrow  </s>
<s> for some notion of structure, but different isomorphisms can preserve different aspects of the structure.  </s>
<s> Well established where?  </s>
<s> In mathematical circles?  </s>
<s> You are not writing just for mathematicians.  </s>
<s> I don't know what it means.  </s>
<s> If I am a member of the intended audience of this document then a part of the intended audience is not going to understand this bit.  </s>
<s> I suggest saying this in the draft.  </s>
<s> Why are there two revisions 1.2?  </s>
<s> :) Brian  </s>
<s> I could subscribe under most of Brian's comments.  </s>
<s> In particular, I agree that the document can be shortened substantially.  </s>
<s> It's supposed to be a spec...  </s>
<s> I would suggest to keep Sec. 2 short and get to the 'meat' of the document, the abstract data model, as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> Sec. 4 definitely needs to be rearranged, e.g., in the way Brian suggested (top-down).  </s>
<s> The graph model could be defined more concisely and a bit more formally.  </s>
<s> I'd also move all business of XML syntax after the graph model has been presented, or maybe into the syntax doc altogether.  </s>
<s> Sec.  </s>
<s> 2.2, and 2.3 could possibly be reduced to one page each.  </s>
<s> Sec.  </s>
<s> 2.1 and 2.4 could be replaced by an introductory paragraph in Sec. 1 and 4, respectively.  </s>
