<s> sorry! the link has changed and the file I downloaded did not save all the text.  </s>
<s> Will ask for it.  </s>
<s> Their archive simply point you to a bio not logical .  </s>
<s> If anyone outside is intereted here is some pertinent information at the bottom of the current page on 508 and the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD).  </s>
<s> Mr. Dennet states, "I guess I'd like to put in a plug for a program called the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.  </s>
<s> It's called JWOD.  </s>
<s> That's a program where the federal government acquires goods and services from people that are disabled and blind.  </s>
<s> E-procurement at first, really shook that special interest group up that has statutory support for the government to buy from it.  </s>
<s> Because they were using the old GSA warehouses.  </s>
<s> But they now have a web site, JWOD.com ( www.jwod.com ) , and they're getting all their products and services online and allowing the government to have access to it through e-procurement.  </s>
<s> I think all of our programs, as they adopt and hook up, will find that e-procurement is the way of the future, and it will help them.  </s>
<s> There is a 75% unemployment rate amongst blind and disabled people.  </s>
<s> The use of e-procurement to place orders with JWOD.com will not only give us good products and services rapidly through e-procurement, but allow us to support these very worthy social programs at the same time.  </s>

<s> we don't need another social program.  </s>
