<s> The CGI URLS at my proxy make up 11% of all accesses.  </s>
<s> In terms of unique URLs, CGI URLs make up 15%.  </s>
<s> Of these 56% are accessed more Average CGI transfer 6404  </s>
<s> I'd be more interested in increasing the hit rate on cacheable URLs.  </s>
<s> I can't discern the hit rate from your data, but if you're getting a 40% hit rate then, sure, you can try to squeeze the remaining 5% (48% of 11%) out of it.  </s>
<s> Well, actually the current hit rate is zero.  </s>
<s> Due to sizing problems we have had to turn off caching a few weeks ago.  </s>
<s> That's why I found out about this list, and also why I wrote some code to analyze 600MB of log files.  </s>
<s> I'm looking to implement a multi-level cache, distributed over three sites, but today I am just collecting data to model the sizing issues.  </s>
<s> To answer another recent post, I am looking at implementing a central proxy cache of ~30 GB, using Netscape 2.0 (or 2.1 which Netscape claims will be performance-enhanced).  </s>
<s> We will start testing in a few weeks.  </s>
<s> Here are my cache stats (for a small workgroup, data in megabytes) - Total cacheable URLs: 64194/90.51  </s>
<s> Total cacheable data: 427.2/91.98 Unique cacheable URLs: 29799/46.42/42.01  </s>
<s> Unique cacheable data: 301.2/70.50/64.85  </s>
<s> URLs accessed only once: 23138/77.65/36.04/32.62  </s>
<s> Data accessed only once: 242.2/80.41/56.69/52.15  </s>
<s> Unique non-cacheable URLs: 1204/17.88/  </s>
<s> 1.70 Unique non-cacheable data: 6.5/17.37/  </s>
<s> 1.39 I have similar numbers in terms of cacheable (91%) and non-cacheable (9%) URLs.  </s>
<s> The percentage of URLs accessed only once is relatively high: 78% of unique cacheable URLs, 36% of total cacheable URLs, or 33% of total URLs.  </s>
<s> And the percentage of data accessed only once is even higher: 80% of unique cacheable, 57% of total cacheable, or 52% of total data.  </s>

<s> EXPIRED/freq: 697/ 1.09 REFRESH/freq: 3196/ 5.00 IMS/freq: 15564/24.34  </s>
<s> ERR/freq: 239/ 0.37 The percentage of hits is relatively small (17% of requests and 21% of data) and I'd like to increase this.  </s>
<s> But it looks like the best I can hope for is about 40% of total data volume (+ 52% accessed once + 8% non-cacheable = 100%).  </s>
<s> Has anyone been able to do better than 40%?  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if that's the practical limit.  </s>
<s> That's what I'm seeing as well.  </s>
<s> The best I could hope for would be 37% of the URLs, which would account for 48% of the data.  </s>
<s> And this assumes that none of the pages have expired (which I can't easily see from the logs) within the week.  </s>
<s> What I did notice that as the number of logs analyzed increase, the potential hit rates did get better.  </s>
<s> When I looked at one day, I calculated that I should only be able to get a 28% hit rate(URLs).  </s>
<s> With two days data in cache, I should be able to get a 33% hit rate.  </s>
<s> One week - 37%.  </s>
<s> The relationship is not linear with respect to time, and I expect to see diminishing returns, but I imagine that if the cache is large enough to store all accesses for a month, the hit rate would increase even higher.  </s>
<s> I could try to analyze a month's worth of  </s>

<s> program isn't up to the task.  </s>
<s> However, the overhead of managing the cache increases with the size.  </s>
<s> Or is it the square of the size?  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> It depends on how the cache is structured (and the OS it runs on).  </s>
<s> If stupidly structured (i.e. flat) on a standard Unix then it is O(n^2), or worse.  </s>
<s> If sensibly structured, then it is O(n*log(n)) (probably).  </s>

<s> Of course, it depends on how long you set your TTLs and how long ago the modified times are.  </s>
<s> I suspect that with longer TTLs you'll see more IMS and REFRESH requests (due to users hitting the reload button), which is actually not a bad thing since you're still saving bandwidth over a clean MISS.  </s>

<s> We have a techreport: which discusses some issues in the relation between cache size and hit rate.  </s>
<s> Actually, we have also done some simulations on the performance of hierarchical and/or cooperating caches; a report on that is not available yet, but the bottom line is the following: N cooperating caches (a la Harvest) with disk capacity D each work almost as a single cache with N*D disk space (for N not too large, let's say N  10).  </s>
<s> The communication between caches is a small fraction of the overall traffic (because it only affects documents which are accessed more than once).  </s>
