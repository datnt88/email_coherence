<s> Thanks for your comment and for reviewing our documents.  </s>
<s> Appendix B indeed defines sameAs as a subproperty of sameIndividualAs, but also the inverse: sameIndividualAs is defined as a subproperty of sameAs: The combination of these two subproperty statements implies that the extensions of sameAs and sameIndividualAs are identical.  </s>

<s> "Identity" is the most basic concept in logic.  </s>
<s> OWL should be able to express "identity" directly, instead of having to prove it.  </s>

<s> Richard - I am a bit confused about this comment.  </s>
<s> I agree with what you say above, but you are bringing up this problem in the context of as RDFS description of owl -- and RDFS has no way to directly express identity (other than using the same URI) instead one must create something like what we have done below -- making two things subproperties of each other.  </s>
<s> In OWL we would be able to do what you want, but the appendix you are asking about was designed to be an RDFS document.  </s>
<s> That is, Owl certainly has the ability to express identity directly.  </s>
<s> For example, I can say :JohnKennedy a person.  </s>
<s> :JackKennedy a person.  </s>
<s> :JohnKennedy owl:sameAs :JackKennedy.  </s>
<s> So I see that we can do exactly what you ask, we just can't put it into the appendix you're asking it to go in, because that appendix is written in the less expressive RDFS - Jim Hendler  </s>
