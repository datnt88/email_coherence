<s> Okay -- it's pretty crude, but this is what we have been up to.  </s>
<s> I've defined an external DTD, called methods.dtd.  </s>
<s> Inside this dtd, I have definitions for describing a particular test scenario (at this point, it is crude, but allows us to illustrate the point).  </s>
<s> We would of course augment this test description with pointers to the spec, and additional documentation for generating in-line comments for code, etc.  </s>
<s> This file also contains a conditional include, which defines names for each binding (methods for Java, functions or properties for ECMAScript).  </s>
<s> I've come to realize that what we have is overkill -- we don't really need a type definition for each call -- instead, we could simply have a collection of allowable types.  </s>
<s> At any rate, this approach relies on using the idl name as the entity name and the particular binding as the value of the entity.  </s>
<s> I also have something called domtests.xml,  </s>
<s> which calls in methods.dtd, and a discrete set of tests -- right now, it is nist/node.xml  </s>
<s> -- inside node.xml,  </s>
<s> I have definitions for each test scenario -- this example uses only the nodeType tests, but I think it can be extended to cover all of our tests.  </s>
<s> Under test scenario, I've defined the necessary steps, using the appropriate idl entity def's, which will in turn substitute the approriate bindings, to execute a particular test.  </s>
<s> This approach needs some additional work -- in particular, support for if's and loops, operating on a particular object, and simple assignments.  </s>
<s> Using the supplied stylesheet, java.xsl,  </s>
<s> I'm able to generate a set of node tests.  </s>
<s> I'm currently using the xerces parser and xalan 2. I've supplied a simple Test driver, Test.java, that loads the xml file we are operating on -- staff.xml (staff.dtd) and simply uses the reflection api to get at all defined test methods, run them, and print out the results.  </s>
<s> I've purposely kept this simple until we know the end approach -- at that point, it can be polished to work with additional parsers, different input files, and automatically comparing expected and actual results.  </s>
<s> The idea is that we can write additional stylesheets for ECMAScript, Perl, Python, etc. Comments / suggestions?  </s>

<s> Mostly it's a difference in presentation.  </s>
<s> In Perl there could be two levels of conformance testing, one at the "full DOM API" level using an OMG IDL wrapper and the standard tests, but also a level that tests what Perl considers the "lite DOM API"[1], which, for reference, is currently only in draft.  </s>
<s> That may be the thinking behind the original question.  </s>
<s> We should be able to work out what the crossover is.  </s>

<s> Mostly it's a difference in presentation.  </s>
<s> Is this W3C's point of view?  </s>
<s> Is this applied only to Perl's implementation?  </s>
<s> I'd say it's Perl-specific at this point.  </s>
<s> -- Ken  </s>
<s> Yep. The DOM test suite will test for compliance against the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> If you fail tests, you aren't compliant.  </s>
<s> If you deliberately don't implement all the DOM behaviors, you should be able to predict exactly what tests you're going to fail.  </s>
<s> (Note that passing a test suite never proves compliance since it's impossible to test every possible case, but failing it -- assuming the test is correct -- definitely establishes a point of noncompliance.) If you want to discuss whether the DOM might define specific subsets and compliance to those subsets, that's a topic for the IG list rather than this one.  </s>
<s> Start by reading the open issues list (level_3_issues.html),  </s>
<s> specifically the section titled "Lightweight DOM"; we _have_ considered the issue before but it's unlikely to fly unless there is a subset whose exact boundaries are widely agreed upon (meaning cross-langage and cross-implementation) and which defines a fairly sharp functional/semantic boundary.  </s>
<s> For example, the "read-only DOM tree" proposal passes the second test but so far has failed the first despite several attempts.  </s>
