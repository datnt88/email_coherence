<s> Going back to the 21 January draft (for the sake of a convenient document) the checkpoint says that these mechanism, where they exist, should be implemented usign standard mechanisms, so that users can find them in a familiar manner.  </s>
<s> I think that is what they should say still, and i think it would eb easier to find them if they stay where they are.  </s>
<s> The standard things they need to do are to meet OS/system requirements for user interface (i.e. be readily identifiable by looking at them) as well as being programmatically exposed.  </s>
