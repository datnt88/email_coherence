<s> Here is a question about the copyright issues involved when creating a DOM implementation.  </s>
<s> The copyright notice creation of "modifications or derivatives".  </s>
<s> My perception is that the creation of a DOM implementation involves making a derivative work of the DOM API published in are published under the mentioned copyright notice, so how can any legal DOM (level 1) implementation exist?  </s>
<s> Regarding DOM level 2, there is a distinction between the "document" and the "bindings", with the latter being published under a different license that permits modifications.  </s>
<s> The copyright notice  </s>
<s> the "IDL binding", while the table of contents speeks of "Java Language Binding" and "ECMA Script Language Binding", but "IDL Definitions" instead of IDL binding.  </s>
<s> Are these "IDL Definitions" really meant by the term "IDL binding", and if they are, could this be made more clear in the level 2 document?  </s>
<s> Thanks for your thoughts, Tobias  </s>
<s> It seems fairly clear that the first "notice" refers to the documents on the W3C site.  </s>
<s> It is understandable that W3C would not authorize changes to the documents posted on its site, since this would lead to confusion about the official standard.  </s>
<s> The second "notice" refers to the "software and documentation."  </s>
<s> This is a software implemenation of the W3C standard and the documentation to use the  </s>
<s> implementation.  </s>
<s> This does authorize modification, but only on the conditions stated.  </s>
<s> By the way, there is a technical difference between a "notice" and a "license."  </s>
<s> A "notice" is merely notice to the user that a claim of copyright exists.  </s>
<s> Under the Berne Convention, no "notice" is required to secure copyright protection, although one is often used in some circles.  </s>
<s> Under the recent WIPO Copyright Treaty, a "notice" now becomes "rights  </s>
<s> management information" whose unauthorized removal is actionable in itself.  </s>
<s> A "license" is a contractual commitment, enforced by contract law in addition to enforcement allowed under copyright law.  </s>
<s> The W3C "Notice and License" appears to be both a notice and a license.  </s>
<s> Lorin Brennan  </s>
<s> This is not exactly true.  </s>
<s> "modifications or derivatives" is about the document itself.  </s>
<s> So yes, according to the DOM Level 1 copyright, you had no right to modify or create derivatives of the DOM Level 1 bindings.  </s>
<s> It doesn't prevent you to use them, btw.  </s>
<s> yes, we discovered that the DOM Level 1 document copyright statement is too restrictive for the bindings (in others words, the copyright for the bindings in DOM Level 1 was an error).  </s>
<s> So, following a comment from the Debian community, we changed the copyright statement to match their requirements of open source softwares.  </s>
<s> Good catch, this needs to be synchronized before the REC !  </s>
<s> Thank you, Philippe  </s>
<s> While it does not prevent me from using this API in a given DOM level 1 implementation, but it actually prevents me from creating such an implementation.  </s>
<s> Here is a concrete example: I began to create a DOM level 1 wrapper in C++ around Daniel Veillards libxml.  </s>
<s> I used the IDL definitions file from the w3c website and modified it using an editor so that it becomes C++ class declarations.  </s>
<s> However, I realize now that I have created a modified copy of a part of the DOM level 1 specification document, and that I had no right to do that according to that document's copyright notice, thus I must not distribute the result.  </s>
<s> Using an IDL compiler won't help, since such a compiler does nothing else than creating a modified copy of the IDL definition file.  </s>
<s> Reading the Level 1 recommendation and creating a matching class hierarchie won't help either, it is also nothing else than creating a modified copy.  </s>
<s> I cannot see a way to create a DOM level 1 implementation without breaking copyright laws.  </s>
<s> So my question is: How have the existing DOM level 1 been created?  </s>
<s> Is there a way to achieve this without breaking copyright laws, a way that I simply fail to see?  </s>
<s> Tobias  </s>
<s> As I said, this is a known error in the DOM Level 1 spec (and it's going to be fixed soon since the DOM WG is planning to update the DOM Level 1 spec).  </s>
<s> The bindings of the DOM specification are under the Software notice: See also: btw, for the update, we never received any answer from the open source organization (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html)  </s>
<s> after our request to obtain the OSI certification ... Regards, Philippe Philippe Le Hegaret - http://www.w3.org/People/LeHegaret/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), DOM Activity Lead  </s>
