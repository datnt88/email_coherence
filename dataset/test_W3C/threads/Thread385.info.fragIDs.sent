<s> hi, I am writing an application which is supposed to remove Java/VB/ASP/Php scripts from an HTML page.  </s>
<s> Can anyone please give me some insight as to how do I do the same using html-tidy software.? Presently I am going through Parser.c and PPrint.c files.  </s>
<s> thanks in advance,  </s>
<s> --Suresh  </s>
<s> Basically this could be done via a modified printing routine in pprint.c,  </s>
<s> but what are you going to do about scripts like if some condition markup for use if the condition is true else markup for use if the condition is false You can't pick the right markup unless you know the value of the condition.  </s>
<s> Other problems arise from computed values.  </s>
<s> In short, I don't think this problem is tractable *in general*.  </s>
