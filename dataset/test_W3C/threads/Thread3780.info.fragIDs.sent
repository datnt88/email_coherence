<s> My current  </s>

<s> Possibly also context sensitive so that references to specific elements will trigger appropriate explanations.  </s>

<s> It's not really a serious issue for packaging; the different sets of messages are completely interchangable as far as building and running a working installation are concerned.  </s>
<s> I haven't asked there.  </s>
<s> The basic issue is that some of the changes are pretty specific to the validation task, and would probably not  </s>
<s> be appropriate to other OpenSP applications.  </s>
<s> For example, it replaces a warning about NET-enabling start tag with (from memory) "Stray slash found in start tag: are you confusing SGML and XML (or HTML and XHTML) syntax?"  </s>
<s> Do you think I should post a diff to openjade-devel with a pointer to this thread, and ask for opinions?  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Ok, but there's stuff like http://validator.w3.org:8001/docs/errors.html  </s>
<s> ...  </s>
<s> That's what I'd do.  </s>
<s> It's a win-win situation for everyone in the end if even some of the changes are considered improvements to OpenSP and get applied there.  </s>
