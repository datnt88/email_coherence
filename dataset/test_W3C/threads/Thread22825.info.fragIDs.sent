<s> Currently the createCSSStyleSheet method under the DOMImplementationCSS interface does not throw any exceptions.  </s>
<s> Should this method throw a SYNTAX_ERR exception in the case that the media DOMString has a syntax error and is unparsable?  </s>
<s> Also, Under Section 5.2, the insertRule method of the CSSMediaRule interface the description for the 'rule' parameter states that it is "The parsable text representing the rule.  </s>
<s> For rule sets this contains both the selector and the style declaration.  </s>
<s> For at-rules, this specifies both the at-identifier and the rule content."  </s>
<s> Should this actually say something like "The parsable text representing the rule sets' selector and style declaration."?  </s>
<s> Any at rules would generate SYNTAX_ERR exceptions.  </s>
