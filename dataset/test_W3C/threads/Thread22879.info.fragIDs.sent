<s> I also agree it isn't a good idea to specify these as additional valueTypes.  </s>
<s> My original comment was just to add clarifying language that when these interfaces are used that the CSSValue base instance should use CSS_CUSTOM.  </s>

<s> These things aren't values anyway, they are things that are assigned values (properties), and more will need to be added in future CSSOM's, as you point out.  </s>
