<s> Hi, I am developing a site using XHTML and CSS that degrades gracefully to a linear format for older browsers and text readers.  </s>
<s> Users with their own stylesheets should be able to override the site colours and font sizes without any problems.  </s>
<s> The problem we have is that the client wants the content to be centred on the page with some fixed width columns - if you try to increase the font size in the browser some of the content ends up overlapping from one column to the one beside it.  </s>
<s> It only happens with the menu column down the left hand side when there are long words in the menu.  </s>
<s> I can get around this by providing a 'text only' style link on the page so that users with problems can get the linear version.  </s>
<s> Ideally I should try to persuade the client to move to more flexible columns, but I have failed so far.  </s>
<s> What would you suggest the best way to go with this is?  </s>
<s> I would appreciate your feedback.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker  </s>
<s> I would not use nor call it a text only page.  </s>
<s> I would if the client insists  </s>
<s> charge extra for the required duplication and code the page so that it works  </s>
<s> correctly and link to it with an accessible page link if need be and leave the other the way the client wants it to be.  </s>
<s> In this way, everyone gets the  </s>
<s> full functionality of the page.  </s>

<s> Hi David, OK, so you are suggesting doing the two versions, but rather than use a 'Text Only' link call it something like 'Accessibility version'.  </s>
<s> What's the best wording for it?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker  </s>
<s> That's a good question, the main thing though is that it is not a text only  </s>
<s> page for two reasons at least.  </s>
<s> one is that it separates us out as is mentioned in another message and the other is that text only is not too accessible.  </s>
<s> call it the universal link or the alternate link.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure  </s>
<s> what to call it.  </s>
<s> It is certainly not non graphical some call them low bandwidth but only if that is the case.  </s>
<s> how about wcag compliant version link?  </s>
<s> around an accessibility problem?  </s>

<s> Hi David, Thanks for the further comments.  </s>
<s> I could use 'wcag compliant', but doubt that many people will know what it means.  </s>
<s> I think that I might just call the link 'full screen', 'flexible layout' or something along those lines and get the link to change the styles so that the layout is a flexible full width design.  </s>
