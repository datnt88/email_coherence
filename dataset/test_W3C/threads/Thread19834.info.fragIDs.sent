<s> I have detected two problems with amaya - V1.1c (under Digital Unix, Linux and WIndows NT) : 1) the horizontal scroll-bar does not work.  </s>
<s> If the page contains an image wider than the window, it is clipped and the scroll-bar does not move to show the real size.  </s>
<s> 2) opening an URL like a href=Image.gif results in the binary contents being displayed instead of the image.  </s>
<s> Including the image in an html file with img src="Image.gif"  </s>
<s> works fine.  </s>

<s> I have noticed a significant amount of refresh delay running under Win95/NT.  </s>
<s> Generally, the screen will go blank for a few seconds while scrolling as new positions are calculated.  </s>
<s> (I would assume) This occurs more dramatically the faster the text is scrolled.  </s>
<s> (If things are scrolled _really_ slowly, it is not too bad.  </s>
<s> Paging down causes it to take a bit before displaying.  </s>
<s> Are there any plans to speed this up?  </s>
<s> Or, am I the only one who has experienced this?  </s>

<s> Hi Daniel, 1.  </s>
<s> You can't use the horizontal scroll in amaya.  </s>
<s> This is a choice it is not a bug.  </s>
<s> 2. At the present time, you can't open an image with amaya if it is not referenced in a HTML file.  </s>
