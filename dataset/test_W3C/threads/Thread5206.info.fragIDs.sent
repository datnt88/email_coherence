<s> Hi Apologies if there is an obvious answer to this, but I havent been able to locate it via browsing, searching or asking yet: is there a working group, standard, best practice or even published proprietary API for deploying an ontology via Web Services.  </s>
<s> I am interested in the case of a community managed ontology, where working groups can be delegated to maintain parts of the ontology, all via a single web accessible repository.  </s>
<s> Applications would be able to search this repository as required.  </s>
<s> I would like the ability to:  </s>
<s> 1) insert, update or delete classes  </s>
<s> 2) find references that directly depend on a class  </s>
<s> 3) query  </s>
<s> 4) ideally, insert an entire OWL ontology including relationships to pre-existing classes...  </s>
<s> 5) ... which implies having a stable URI to reference items within the deployed ontology in the first place  </s>
<s> Maybe there is no API that makes sense, and its always only possible to think about publishing a single file, and using xlink to try to glue it all together - in which case there should be some serious thought somewhere about the query mechanisms you would use to perform typical ontology traversals.  </s>
<s> I'd be happy with a registry-friendly model where the transactions can be defined to be honest.  </s>
<s> Can anyone point me to where such deployment issues are being worked out?  </s>

<s> Rob, you might want to take a look at the work of the EU project Wonderweb.. http://wonderweb.semanticweb.org/  </s>
<s> They might have some tools that are moving in the direction you are seeking.  </s>

<s> Hi Rob, Two tools might be interesting for you: * the Sesame ontology store and query engine (available as a WS), see: * the WebOde - a web based ontology editor which offers support for multiple users, see: http://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/webODE/.  </s>

<s> Rob -- You may be interested in the Internet Business Logic system for this.  </s>
<s> It's live, online at www.reengineeringllc.com .  </s>
<s> The author- and user-interface is a browser.  </s>
<s> Several people can point their browsers to one ontology, and cooperatively edit it (with locking).  </s>
<s> If one person has the ontology locked for changes, others can run, the prior unchanged version.  </s>
<s> The notation is closer to English than OWL, supported by a heavyweight inference engine.  </s>
<s> Your points 1-5 below are supported, though 4 might need a bit more work.  </s>
<s> A good example to start with is RDFQueryLangComparison1 .  </s>
<s> HTH. Thanks in advance for comments.  </s>

<s> The closest is the DIG interface.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> It depends on what you mean.  </s>
<s> You can add to a class expression, or to the axioms.  </s>
<s> But there is no deletion.  </s>
<s> I don't know what this means.  </s>
<s> At least a standard set of DL queries.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> I don't understand this.  </s>
<s> The DIG interface is incomplete, but it is implemented and deployed (see the oiled and protege editors for some examples).  </s>
<s> Our group raised some of this as a requirement for the Data Access Working Group (DA-WG): 0286.html  </s>
<s> Our reasoner, Pellet, also supporst some of this in a fairly crude, GET oriented sort of way: We are working on a solution based on XPointer that would give you some useful URIs for parts of the ontology.  </s>
<s> Not a lot of this is trivial, or even straightforward, unless you are really working against something like the XML of a document.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> This is the goal of the Open Source RDF/RDFS/OWL editor "pOWL" - it is currently under heavy development.  </s>
<s> Maybe you would like to check the website at: An interactive demo is provided, but pOWL lacks an exhaustive documentation.  </s>
<s> Please use the mailinglist and forums at the SourceForge project page and feel free to add feature requests at the tracker.  </s>
<s> Most of the things you mentioned are already implemented, nevertheless pOWL ist still of late alpha / early beta quality.  </s>
<s> A first stable version is planned for August, please subscribe to the powl-releases mailinglist at sourceforge (http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/powl-releases)  </s>
