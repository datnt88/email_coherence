<s> Dear members, I have translated the WAI-Quick Tips document to my native language, Kannada and would like to put it up in the translated pages list of the W3C site.  </s>
<s> Following is the link for the translated document: Please do the needful.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Note: Kannada is the language spoken in Karnataka State in South India.  </s>
<s> Bangalore, the "Silicon Valley" of India is the capital of Karnataka.  </s>
<s> The population of Karnataka is approximately 55 million.  </s>
<s> PS: I have also included a few details in Kannada script in the attached HTML file that might be useful.  </s>
<s> Regards, Narasimha Datta Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, INDIA  </s>
<s> Narashimha, thank you.  </s>
<s> However, there seem to be a (minor) problem.  </s>
<s> Neither the attached file nor the translation itself appears properly on my screen (I tried to different browsers, running Win2K).  </s>
<s> Looking at the source, the character encoding is set to iso-8859-1, which is obviously wrong.  </s>
<s> Interestingly, you did set utf-8 in the meta statement of the attached file, but it is still unreadable, I suspect the encoding went wrong somewhere (maybe it is safer to put this info somewhere on the web, rather than send it through an email...) Can you set these?  </s>
<s> Thank you again Ivan P.S. I want to particularly thank you for the attached information, it is clear that you spoke to your colleages...  </s>

<s> Thanks for the prompt response.  </s>
<s> I have corrected the encoding part (set it to UTF-8) - I am able to view the HTML pages correctly on my Mozilla browser.  </s>
<s> You need a Kannada font to be able to view the translation (though I don't know how much you will be able to decipher out of it :-)).  </s>
<s> If you are interested, you can download Sampige.ttf from: http://brahmi.sourceforge.net/downloads.html.  </s>
<s> Regarding the previously attached file containing some Kannada translated words, I have uploaded it to: this helps.  </s>
<s> Thanks and regards, Narasimha  </s>
