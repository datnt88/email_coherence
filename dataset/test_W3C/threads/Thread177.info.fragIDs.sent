<s> A lot of the authoring tools automatically generate, for example, I and B in place of em and strong (MS FrontPage 98 generated the latter, but FP2000 has reverted to the former -- with no option to change or set it).  </s>
<s> It would be handy if there were a "replace-elements" option to obviate the need for Perl, XSL, or a text editor's search-and-replace function.  </s>
<s> Something like: replace-elements: i, em; b, strong PS.  </s>

<s> An interesting idea, although I guess I would prefer a slightly different syntax, e.g. replace-tags: i/em, b/strong  </s>

<s> No. The only question would be how it interacts with the clean operations.  </s>
