<s> It would be nice if the Node interface had a "hook" property -- that is, a read/write property in which the user could store any value they like.  </s>
<s> (I don't know what the IDL type is, but this would be equivalent to Object in Java or void * in C/C++.)  </s>
<s> As an example of why this is useful, consider the problem of constructing a DOM tree based on external order information.  </s>
<s> That is, the DOM construction code receives DOM nodes along with the information, "This is the third child," "This is the fourteenth child," etc.  </s>
<s> To perform this task, the code needs to know the order value associated with each node in the tree.  </s>
<s> With a hook property, the application could store order values with each node and either build the tree in sorted order or sort after the tree is complete.  </s>
<s> Without a hook property, the application must encapsulate each node and add the order property -- more work than seems necessary.  </s>
<s> Another use (inspired by recent discussions on xml-dev) would be storing the current namespace scoping information.  </s>
<s> I am certain that many other uses/abuses could be found as well.  </s>
<s> -- Ronald Bourret P.S. Please cc me on any replies, as I am not a member of this list.  </s>
<s> Check the DOM Level 3 Core draft:  </s>
<s> The intent is to address the "hook" property as well as memory management associated with it and multi-threading environment.  </s>
<s> Feedback is welcome.  </s>
<s> The type Object exists in IDL.  </s>
<s> As a side comment, the DOM Level 3 XPath gives you this information: We didn't find any interest or enough use cases to add this Node into the DOM Level 3 Core module.  </s>
<s> XPath was our only main one.  </s>

<s> That does exactly what I need.  </s>
<s> (My code wouldn't use the UserDataHandler interface, but it's easy to imagine code that would.) My only objection is the name "DOMKeyObject", which sounds like a key, not data.  </s>
<s> "DOMDataObject" or "DOMUserDataObject" would be better.  </s>
<s> Too bad.  </s>
<s> This would be useful for anyone traversing the tree and wanting to discover what namespace declarations are in force at the time.  </s>
<s> Two use cases are: 1) Figuring out if you need to add an xmlns attribute after moving a node from one location to another.  </s>
<s> (I would prefer that DOM did this for you, but in the absence of that, this node would be very useful.  </s>
<s> The alternative is to traverse the path back to the root and figure it out myself.  </s>
<s> Yech.)  </s>
<s> 2) Resolving QNames in attribute or element content.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how many languages do this, but at least some do.  </s>
<s> Note that it would be most useful if, instead of having a set of Namespace Nodes, I could simply call Node.getPrefix(uri) and Node.getURI(prefix).  </s>
<s> -- Ron  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> The DOM will do that for you but not automatically.  </s>
<s> It is one of the purposes of the normalizeDocument method: This method works with the normalization features (also used in the Load and Save module.  </s>
<s> One of them is "namespace-declarations" and is activated by default.  </s>
<s> Calling normalizeDocument will add the appropriate xmlns declarations for you.  </s>
<s> We're still working on that but you can take a look at lookupNamespaceURI and lookupNamespacePrefix on the Node interface: We are currently improving the namespace algorithms and default namespace handling.  </s>
<s> see above.  </s>
