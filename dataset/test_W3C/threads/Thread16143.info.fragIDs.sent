<s> Regarding "Designing Pages Accessible to Limited Textual Comprehension User" by Kynn Bartlett.  </s>
<s> One group of users that Kynn mentions is users who are not native speakers/readers of the language of a site.  </s>
<s> In this regard, cultural issues are very important.  </s>
<s> 1. images often mean less In my view, a word like "home" is much more useful than an icon.  </s>
<s> When "home" is used on an English language site on the web, it is clear that it referres to the website's home page.  </s>
<s> On the other hand I recall browsing in some Swedish website (in Engish) and it took me some time to realize  </s>
<s> (due to my Swedish culture disabilities) that the icon of "a trip to an exotic snowy country with a wooden hut in a thick forest" means "home".  </s>
<s> 2. Don't use words in their localized jargon meaning.  </s>
<s> Use the official dictionary meaning to avoid mis-understandings.  </s>
<s> The usage of the term "religious" in a negative manner in regard to the usage of images is counter productive.  </s>
<s> One should note that there are religions that have heavy restrictions on the usage of images (notably Islam, and to a certain extent Judaism), some people may be offended by the implication that there is something wrong with their religion.  </s>

<s> Subject: Avoiding Cultural Influences  </s>
<s> Is it _possible_ for someone from a particular culture to avoid writing things from their perspective?  </s>
<s> If so, is it _desirable_ that authors deliberately do this?  </s>
<s> In my opinion this is the most frightening thought to come out of this discussion.  </s>
<s> A world so "homogenized" we lose the beauty of our differences and the value of different points of view.  </s>
<s> You can go to far in the name of "political correctness"!  </s>

<s> Is it _possible_ for someone from a particular culture to avoid writing things from their perspective?  </s>
<s> If so, is it _desirable_ that authors deliberately do this?  </s>
<s> From a writer's standpoint (I'm not really one, but given 36  </s>
<s> hours in a day, I'd become one), each author has a specific "voice", a unique viewpoint from which she is writing.  </s>
<s> That is part of the creative process -- part of what makes the writer herself worth reading.  </s>
<s> And a factor in that unique viewpoint will undoubtedly be the her cultural background.  </s>
<s> Is it desirable, in the name of "cultural correctness", to homogenize all writings, and risk eliminating that unique viewpoint that she's trying to present?  </s>

<s> How does she gauge the effect her culture has had upon her, without being an expert in every society on Earth?  </s>
<s> How will she know if there is someone in a far- off country who would not understand her choice of metaphors?  </s>
<s> Does anyone have a reference on how to identify these things in your own writing?  </s>
<s> Are there any understandable, non- academic guidelines for doing so?  </s>
<s> Or is it all hit and miss?  </s>

<s> All, I think that when you are trying to convey a particular aspect of a culture, you would not want to be sterile and avoid cultural influences.  </s>
<s> In fact you would want to try to convey to the ready what those influences are and to convey a sense of the culture.  </s>
<s> Howver, when you are simply passing along non cultural information such as instructions or scientific information I would think you would want to be a neutral as possible  </s>

<s> This is good in theory but there are some matters of style that play a role in even technical instructions.  </s>
<s> I spoke with my friend Laurie Harrison about this -- she said that my writings on web accessibility have a very specific _tone_ to them.  </s>
<s> I have a particular style of writing, which some think is "approachable" but which I just think of as "how I write", that is different from how Laurie writes, or Ann writes, or Jutta writes, or Charles writes.  </s>
<s> Even when communicating technical details, we all have our own "personality", which can be heavily influenced by our culture.  </s>
<s> Take a look at Jakob Nielsen -- sure, he has good content, but part of why he's entertaining to read is that you can feel a strong sense of _Jakob_ come through.  </s>
<s> An opinionated, stubborn, intelligent person -- with a European background.  </s>
<s> I think his cultural perspective is more than a quirk in his writing, it's a tangible _asset_ -- and there would be a danger if we felt that we had to silence that perspective in the name of greater understanding.  </s>
<s> I don't want to sound like I'm paranoid and ranting here, I'm just trying to figure out where we should draw the line between "increasing understanding" and "promoting homogeneity"?  </s>

<s> Your article makes the point that writing simple English and using images will make one's site more international.  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> Even fully translating a site won't work without taking into account cultural differences.  </s>
<s> Doing international business through the web is technologically easyer, but it cannot be accomplished trivially.  </s>
<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> I was thinking more from a business point of view.  </s>
<s> When I try to sell my old car, I compromize my artistic freedom, and don't argue with my customers on irrelevant issues such as politics.  </s>
<s> This doesn't make my car less interesting to the potential buyer.  </s>
<s> Why homogenize?  </s>
<s> just use the simplest and clearest language appropriate for the intended audiance.  </s>
<s> There is some guideline like that in the WCAG1.0.  </s>
<s> I was thinking more of doing business (in a commercial site) rather than any sort of "correctness".  </s>
<s> If it's desirable,  </s>
<s> Exactly my point.  </s>
<s> Writing simpler English and using images for navigation won't make one's site much more useful internationally.  </s>
<s> Translation is not enough either.  </s>
<s> A localized version of a commercial site must be developed by (or at least with) people of the locality.  </s>
<s> Last thing, I did not claim that you presented religion negatively, but that you critized the position of Nielsen on images in a way that may be misunderstood as critizing religion.  </s>
<s> Regards, Nir Dagan  </s>
<s> cultural neutrality doesn't always work to "increase understanding", so you may want to separate the two issues, Kynn.  </s>
<s> All people are part of their culture, and folks with cognitive, sensory, or physical disabilities are no different.  </s>

<s> You disagree that it doesn't at least _help_?  </s>
<s> (BTW, "simple English" is your term -- I made a point to make sure _not_ to assume that pages would be written in English.)  </s>
<s> I think that proper use of images to convey meaning and use of plain language can help a page be more easily under- stood by a broader audience including people who speak a different language than that of the page.  </s>
<s> Is that saying that it's all that's necessary for "internationalization"?  </s>
<s> No. But it will help some, and it's certainly an easier sell than convincing web designers they need to create multiple, i18n'ed sites in various languages specialized for specific countries in order to feel they are communicating effectively.  </s>
<s> You suggest that "A localized version of a commercial site must be developed by (or at least with) people of the locality."  </s>
<s> And that's a good goal, but it's a lot of work and a lot of expense.  </s>
<s> As many commercial sites may not choose to do this, I think it's good to tell them OTHER things that they MIGHT want to do.  </s>
<s> Do you really think there's no benefit in images and plain language to international users?  </s>
