<s> Pat, this is rather more than just an editorial tweak.  </s>
<s> 1. M&amp;S states that properties are a subset of resources 2. Object oriented implementations of RDF typically have property objects that are subclass of resources - is that still an accurate design?  </s>
<s> 3. I've seen no last call comment that justifies the change The claim in the change log that it does not affect entailments is false.  </s>

<s> rdf entail ppp rdf:type rdf:Resource .  </s>
<s> I believe the answer should be yes, but in any case the answer is distinguishable in RDF.  </s>

<s> This is only for simple interpretations.  </s>
<s> It does not make any difference to RDF or RDFS interpretations, since those interpretations are still required to conform to the subset condition by virtue of their semantic conditions; cf. section 3, 5th para (after the table of RDF semantic conditions):  </s>
<s> "The first condition could be regarded as defining IP to be the set of resources in the universe of the interpretation which have the value I(rdf:Property) of the property I(rdf:type).  </s>
<s> Such subsets of the universe will be central in interpretations of RDFS.  </s>
<s> Note that this condition requires IP to be a subset of IR." So all of the following is still true in RDF, and in all RDF semantic extensions.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> The only document in the entire RDF document suite which mentions  </s>
<s> simple entailment is the semantics doc, and all the lemmas in section 2 still hold.  </s>
<s> The answer is yes.  </s>
<s> No RDF entailments are affected by this change.  </s>
<s> If you really feel that this is a serious matter then I can go back and undo this, but I would rather not, as this makes it clearer that  </s>
<s> it is RDF itself which imposes this condition on IP (by virtue of the 'type Property' condition on properties) rather than the graph syntax in some mysterious way.  </s>
<s> There is no need for this condition to be  </s>
<s> imposed on simple interpretations, is the point - it is only needed for RDF itself - and removing it from there makes the RDF conditions less redundant and makes simple interpretations more like conventional first-order interpretations.  </s>
<s> This is really all a part of the general organizational clean-up made since last call where conditions that apply purely to the RDF vocabulary are all labelled as RDF conditions, for RDFS are labelled RDFS conditions, and so on, ie it distributes content into different  </s>
<s> parts of the document.  </s>
<s> I really do consider it a technicality within scope for an editorial change.  </s>

<s> Well, that's been something I've wondered about myself, but it be a change from the original spec without any compelling justification that I could see.  </s>
