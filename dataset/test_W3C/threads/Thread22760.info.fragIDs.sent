<s> Can you inform me of the desired behaviour of importing a node that has event listeners associated with it.  </s>
<s> And while on this subject can you answer this same question for Document.adoptNode() in DOM Level 3  </s>
<s> Cheers Pat  </s>
<s> The newly created (imported) nodes will start off with no listeners.  </s>
<s> The DOM has no way of knowing which listeners should or shouldn't be attached in the new document , and some might actually cause aplication malfunctions if they were bound to the new nodes, so we leave this for the user to deal with.  </s>
<s> There has been discussion of trying to invent a callback scheme where each listener could say what it wants done in this situation,but I think we decided it was becoming overly baroque.  </s>
<s> Good quesiton.  </s>
<s> adoptNode() is intended to really move the node object from one document to another (in those situations where the DOM can do so without destroying its internal datastructures).  </s>
<s> One can argue that this means the listeners should remain attached.  </s>
<s> But I don't know if we've made a formal decision on that.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> [joe already replied to that question]  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> We decided to not remove the listeners from the Node since we didn't see any technical argument to not do so: When a Node is adopted using the adoptNode method the EventListeners attached to the source Node stay attached to the adopted Node.  </s>
