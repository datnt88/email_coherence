<s> hello, in the Evaluation and Repair Tools working group we have been discussing how to evaluate and repair tables.  </s>
<s> Particularly, nested tables.  </s>
<s> if nested tables are used to present data, is there a way to associate the cells in the inner table with header cells in the outer table?  </s>
<s> I would assume that axis and headers could work across tables (if a UA was built that way).  </s>
<s> However, in HTML 4.0 the only values for "scope" are row, col, rowgroup, and colgroup.  </s>
<s> so, it seems that "scope" could *not* be an inner table.  </s>
<s> Nested tables seem less of a problem for layout tables.  </s>
<s> I propose that the evaluation and repair is to handle each table separately, like Mark Novak's HelpDB tool.  </s>

<s> I would have thought that whatever technique is used to apply headers to a table cell should still apply, except the headers would then apply to the whole of the nested table.  </s>

<s> Indeed, and the user agent would need to communicate the fact that the contents of every such cell is actually a table.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, do there exist genuine data tables which employ nesting other than in an attempt to control layout?  </s>
<s> To my knowledge, nested tables do not appear in conventional printed publications and are largely an artifact of the web, in which case the author should reconsider whether or not to use them at all.  </s>
<s> a 3d bar chart is a simple nested table especially if it is a multi-colored sum, as is a linked excel chart.  </s>
<s> In general spreadsheets are linked and have been historically.  </s>
<s> The difficulty I as a novice have had trying to construct a first nested table indicates to me at least that somewhere, someone took a leap of faith.  </s>
<s> Surely it is not absolute that the constraints on the containing table are global and determine the behaviour of the tables contained.  </s>
<s> This shows a lack of foresight, and given the number of years it has remained a distinct abscence of flexibility.  </s>

<s> Yes, there are a number of cases where tabular data is nested.  </s>
<s> (I can see the tables in books in my mind's eye, but don't have an example to hand.) In some cases it could be done differently, but as onathan pointed out in some cases it makes very good sense as a compact way to present data (in situations where the reader can make use of the structure to improve efficiency of comprehenson).  </s>
