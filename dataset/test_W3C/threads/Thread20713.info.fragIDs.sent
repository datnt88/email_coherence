<s> After a new release of Amaya there are situations that may require a bug-fix release for those who do not have access to CVS and compilers...  </s>
<s> I do not know the priorities of the team but I think some of the situations that should cause a emergency fix-it-up and rerelease are: 1] bugs that crash the system 2] bugs that hang the system 3] bugs that destroy files or authors documents 4] bugs that take a file that validated and makes it into a file that no longer validates!!! Currently there exists a type four problem.  </s>
<s> When comments occur prior to other elements in the head element of a validated file, loading the file into Amaya and saving as foobar creates an invalid file.  </s>
<s> meta and link statements can get moved into the body element.  </s>
<s> My example (rrdiesel.htm) is included as a test document.  </s>
<s> This type of action validates the statement that says Amaya produces valid html.... Can a fix be applied!  </s>
<s> And if so can a new binary release be issued so that the 'produces valid html' is legit!!!

<s> There used to be an automatically created tarball of the CVS stuff that was updated daily or {4 hour}ly.  </s>
<s> This seems to have gone, from what I can see on the Amaya website.  </s>
<s> I haven't got my head around this CVS really yet, so I'd support this being made available again.  </s>
<s> Free compilers are available for most platforms... Hugh  </s>
<s> I tested your file.  </s>
<s> I only had the problem when the elements following the comment were preceded by a line break.  </s>
<s> I don't mean a BR -element, but an actual line break in the textfile.  </s>
<s> When the "jumpy" elements (or rather: the first of them) followed the comment on the same line, they didn't jump.  </s>
<s> Instead Amaya inserted an actual line break.  </s>
<s> Is a comment in HTML invalid if anything else follows it on the same line?  </s>
<s> I don't see anything about that in the specification.  </s>
