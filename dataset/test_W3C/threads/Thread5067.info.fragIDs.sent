<s> Gentlemen  </s>
<s> The new W3C Working Group 'Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment' [1]  </s>
<s> has put Topic Maps on the list of (many) legacy and technologies that it  </s>
<s> would like to be made interoperable with the Semantic Web infrastructure and languages.  </s>
<s> For those technologies, the SWBPD WG purpose is to identify and promote best practices for interoperability.  </s>
<s> The intended process needs to involve participation of qualified experts,  </s>
<s> assuming organizations and communities of users have expressed interest in  </s>
<s> the Semantic Web initiative.  </s>
<s> Relevant preliminary work has been made in recent years in the TM  </s>
<s> community, including various proposals for TM-RDF mapping.  </s>
<s> But this work  </s>
<s> has never been endorsed by any of relevant standard organizations (W3C and  </s>
<s> ISO).  </s>
<s> This message is intended to trigger a process in this direction, provided  </s>
<s> you agree on :  </s>
<s> - A common declaration of interest in collaboration at the organizational  </s>
<s> level, respectively W3C SWBPD and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3.  </s>
<s> ( Consider this  </s>
<s> declaration is made from our side through the present message.  </s>
<s> ) - Definition of a task force, including people proposed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3 as invited experts.  </s>
<s> This task force would have as first objective to deliver a Technical Note  </s>
<s> on best practices for TM-SW interoperability, endorsed by both W3C and ISO.  </s>
<s> We are looking forward for a positive feedback.  </s>

<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/ Remarks: - A TM-RDF workshop mentioned by DanBri during Cannes meeting could it be used as a place to kick-off this process ?  </s>
<s> - The most relevant expert in RDF-TM interoperability is AFAIK Lars Marius  </s>

<s> stylistically this is more formal than I would have made it, but that's no big deal ...  </s>
<s> I am not entirely comfortable with the word 'endorsed' used twice - I am not at all sure that any of our WG Notes constitute endorsement by the W3C.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that the Rec track process is for that.  </s>
<s> Suggest the following changes: 1) delete sentence  </s>
<s> But this work has never been endorsed by any of relevant standard  </s>
<s> organizations (W3C and ISO).  </s>
<s> (Or alternatively replace 'endorsed' by 'followed through')  </s>
<s> 2) modify  </s>
<s> endorsed by both W3C and ISO. to  </s>
<s> potentially jointly published by both W3C and ISO.  </s>

<s> Well, I'm also usually far less formal than that, but I thought that was the place for being formal, since it was a organization-to-organization communication.  </s>
<s> OK. Forgive the vocabulary flaws of the author : neither native english-speaker, nor background in legal vocabulary (just checked dictionary to figure that "endorse" had a stronger meaning than I thought)  </s>
<s> Agreed, but I would stick to the latter.  </s>
<s> Agreed again Bernard  </s>
