<s> [Gregg questioned my suggestion that null ALT strings be used.]  </s>
<s> I myself believe that authors should be encouraged to consider null ALT strings as within their range of choice if they will take the trouble to think about ALT strings at all.  </s>
<s> I have no big problem with "IBM logo" suggestion.  </s>
<s> I would prefer that the WAI not go out to beat people up telling them they must have a non-null ALT string for every image.  </s>
<s> ALT="" is really telling something about the image: that it is pure decoration, but that the user-agent is still free to try to guess what it is (using some HTTP metadata, the filename, etc).  </s>
<s> Another convention I remember coming across regarding null ALT was an optimization of the above where the convention could be stated at the beginning of the HTML, in some kind of (I'm making that syntax up) and the rest of the file would not have an ALT attribute where ALT="" would be used otherwise.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> Yes, the user agent has latitude.  </s>
<s> I hope it also has latitude to elide all evidence of the image (in the initial page presentation) when this is the ALT, so long as there is a follow-up method available (just two examples: in Netscape, the Document Information page; in Lynx the IMAGE_LINKS mode) that would list all used and suppressed references.  </s>
<s> One of the points that may bear repeating is the idea that text-to-speech is a narrowband medium and hence the speech-using visitor may have a bias toward an executive summary of the story on the first go, as opposed to the quantity of information that can be packed on one GUI Web Page.  </s>
<s> So I am hoping that we can couch the message to browser developers in the following way: - REQUIREMENT: (on information accessibility): applies_to_information: LongDesc[Accept=text/*](image_object).  </s>
<s> methods_required: GET The point about the "information definition" is that the browser must support some method for satisfying a query in which the user only has the image [or its name or handle] and wants to get [any, the designated] textual description of that image.  </s>
<s> Text here refers to the Internet Media primary type text/* so as to include HTML, which is the preferred medium for LongDesc.  </s>
<s> The method can be multi-step and interactive.  </s>
<s> It is not required to be an atomic action.  </s>
<s> Example, suggested, or recommended methods may be defined by the guidelines but in this case I think less is more and moral suasion should be focused on the more functional requirement.  </s>
<s> This leaves up to browser experimentation guided by user feedback the layering of whether certain classes of information (discriminated by ALT="" in this case) are represented on the first pass at what level of detail.  </s>
<s> My current thinking revolves around the idea that this is a special case of an About method, and that the Web should be driving toward providing a very short list of pervasive methods.  </s>
<s> About is on my current list of candidate pervasive methods.  </s>
<s> Do, About, ...(I am prepared to hide Help under About but I might lose that one...).  </s>
<s> The point is that the About method would be implemented in different ways in different implementation contexts but that it would be enough of a workalike at all levels so that at least what shows through at the UI level could be consistent.  </s>
<s> An example low-level implementation is to introduce an IREF attribute of HTML tags, a variant on HREF.  </s>
<s> HREF is used on Do and IREF is used on About.  </s>
<s> Example of a high-level implementation is that this About method could be implemented in HTTP via a more vigorously populated HEAD response or new META method.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> One might think that you could do this using CSS1 fragments in the document HEAD .  </s>
<s> This violates the notion that CSS just adjusts frills and doesn't change content.  </s>
<s> The scenario you have raised here is a good example in which to test the idea that some pervasive generation-by-rule [or other abstraction] capability is required throughout, independent of what one considers to be "content" vs. "style."  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Perhaps it would be beneficial to this discussion if the issues under consideration were distinguished.  </s>
<s> First, there is the semantic issue, specifically, the question of what advice should be given to authors with respect to substituting textual content for an image that can not be displayed in a text-only environment.  </s>
<s> This problem should be addressed in style guidelines, although the borderline between what rightly belongs in the HTML specification and what should be left to usage guidelines is becoming increasingly obscure, given that the HTML 4.0 draft is attempting to satisfy the needs of both users and implementors.  </s>
<s> Secondly, there is the question of an appropriate mechanism through which to provide textual alternatives to graphic images.  </s>
<s> Since an inline image is notionally part of the document, there are no structural reasons why at least some of the alternative textual content should not be included within the document itself, as is presently the case with the ALT attribute.  </s>
<s> Since many users may not wish to download or read a lengthy description, there is an argument that they should either reside in separate files, or become components of image files to the extent that the relevant data formats permit.  </s>
<s> However, given that inline images (whether they be inserted by means of the IMG or the OBJECT element) are integral to the document, there is a good case for maintaining that at least a descriptive title or label should be given in the HTML markup itself, and ought not need to be retrieved separately via an HTTP mechanism.  </s>
<s> Irrespective of whether or not one accepts the conceptual argument, this is the design which is imposed upon as by HTML as it presently stands, both in the ALT attribute and the OBJECT element.  </s>
<s> A third issue is the extent to which the user should be able to exercise control over that which is presented in place of an image.  </s>
<s> Certainly, the retrieval of a long description should be optional, and perhaps there should be a means by which users can ignore the presence of decorative graphics, the problem being that some people may nonetheless wish to have access to brief labels for such images.  </s>
<s> Whether this problem can be handled by the client or not is a question that I would like to raise for further consideration.  </s>
<s> I think the OBJECT element should be able to satisfy the requirement for long descriptions: I am very inexperienced at reading DTD's, but it appears from the HTML 4.0 draft that the content of the OBJECT element includes the %inline entity, which in turn should contain the anchor element.  </s>
<s> Thus, to modify one of the examples in the HTML 4.0 draft: object data="figure1.png" type="image/png" Figure 1 a href="figure1-description.html" [description available] /a /object  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the IMG element provides no corresponding solution.  </s>
<s> Would it be better to include an attribute whereby the URL of the document containing the long description can be specified within the IMG start tag, or rely on HTTP mechanisms, or offer both as alternatives that should be available to software developers?  </s>
<s> This is a content rule, so it is normal that it is expressed in HTML, and not in CSS.  </s>
<s> Why would we want to do otherwise ?  </s>
<s> Right on target, the OBJECT element allows for long description.  </s>
<s> (mainly because it is a container, whereas IMG is not and ALT doesn't allow for markup inside its CDATA).  </s>
<s> If it wasn't for pragmatic considerations such as: "nobody uses OBJECT yet, so let's not declare the problem solved with just that in hand", we could indeed say we've got what we want.  </s>
<s> But most, if not all, images are described using IMG, so we need to find a way to express long description using it.  </s>
<s> Dave proposed something like: Another option, along the D-TAG model could be: which has the disadvance of modifying the visible text (I seriously doubt Web designers will agree to have the letter D appearing all over their pages), unless a CSS rule is used such as: A.D-LINK {display: none} but it happens that this display:none functionality which is so useful in this case, is not implemented by the major CSS compliant browser (IE 3 and NS 4), not being part of the core CSS1 properties...  </s>
<s> I personally like the ALTSRC IMG extention.  </s>
<s> I can be simply implemented in browser that wants to support LongDesc functionality and will be ignored by others.  </s>
<s> We could also advocate the use of CLASS=D-LINK, as another mechanism, but I'm worry that pointing at 2 or 3 solutions (we already have OBJECT in place) will not serve us well.  </s>
<s> I would also tend to support the ALTSRC approach, which is a more elegant solution than relying on CSS to eliminate the unwanted side effect (the letter D appearing next to images) that would inevitably result from the alternative method.  </s>
