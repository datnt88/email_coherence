<s> Hello Brant This bug seems to be very odd.  </s>
<s> I can reproduce it, but : - only on a Windows platform, - only with your document, - only the first time I load your document.  </s>
<s> Once the document has been saved with Amaya, the following loadings don't generate extra spaces any more.  </s>
<s> In fact the first time I load your document on a Windows platform, the application receive a buffer from the XML parser that contains twice as much  </s>
<s> CR/LF characters than on a UNIX platform.  </s>
<s> Before to continue, I would like to know if the attached HTM file has been saved with Amaya or with another editor ?  </s>
<s> Regards Laurent Carcone Amaya team  </s>
<s> It was saved with Amaya.  </s>
<s> I believe the file was originally created with Amaya 5.2a and then I upgraded to Amaya 5.3.  </s>
<s> I started a new file and copied with the structure minus extra white space and I have not yet had the problem again to my knowledge.  </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP which is fairly new and there may be some sort of issue with that.  </s>
<s> I think that at the time I may have had my User directory "encrypted" and "compressed" by the NTFS file system.  </s>
<s> It is no longer that way and the problem does not appear to be occurring in any files now.  </s>
<s> Occasionally though, although I saved a file with Amaya, I will reopen it and it will say parsing errors.  </s>
<s> I cannot reproduce these instances, though.  </s>
