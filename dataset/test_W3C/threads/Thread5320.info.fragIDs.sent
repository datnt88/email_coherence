<s> Hi, I am very pleased to see that this mailing list is (at last) created within W3C !  </s>
<s> I truly believe that web services (real) interoperability can only be reached only if web services are described semantically.  </s>
<s> The current trend in web services arena defines the web services using different standards based on XML schemas (UDDI, ebXML,WSDL, SOAP, SAML,XXX,XXXX...).  </s>
<s> IMHO, the huge number of XML schemas to deal with, makes the integration of exiting web services very hard, costly, very brittle and hard to evolve.  </s>
<s> I favor a more loosy coupled architecture, based on a minimal design, that is not based on structure and syntax (such as XML Schema) but rather on semantic information exchange (RDF/OWL).  </s>
<s> I wish to see in the future more focus on systematic mapping of the different standards such as WDSL, BPEL to RDF/OWL.  </s>
<s> I see two important aspect that needs to be standardized: - A core ontology for describing Web Services (such as DAML-S) - A standard ( universal ?) semantic query language based on RDF (support of graph pattern/ filter/ rules / bindings).  </s>
<s> I have not seen so much activity on DAML-S recently ?  </s>
<s> Will W3C try to standardize DAML-S (OWL-S??) What is going on the semantic query language side ?  </s>
<s> I am curious to get your opinions on my thoughts... Best regards Stephane Fellah Senior Software Engineer PCI Geomatics 490, Boulevard St Joseph Hull, Quebec Canada J8Y 3Y7 Visit our web site: www.pcigeomatics.com  </s>
<s> Throwing bigger specifications and bigger repositories at the problem won't really help.  </s>
<s> So I agree that going the semantic web way might offer a nice alternative.  </s>
<s> Regarding web services themselves also a desire to be more minimal can be seen.  </s>
<s> A lot of people are advocating the "REST" style of web services (just using http for sending messages back and forth) over the SOAP style (bigger toolkits, more specifications).  </s>
<s> I think going a more minimal route regarding schemas (semantic data) combines very well with a more minimal approach regarding transport (plain http).  </s>
<s> That's a real semantic web to me.  </s>
<s> I suspect, though, that you can use rdf/owl to good effect in describing and tying together the SOAP kind, too.  </s>

<s> Stephane, W3C issued on october 15 an invitation to the WS-Policy authors to attend a workshop about Constraints and Capabilities.  </s>
<s> Depending on the output of the proposed workshop, work on this topic may start within W3C Web Services Activity.  </s>
<s> Odds are high that people from the OWL-S community will attend such a workshop.  </s>
