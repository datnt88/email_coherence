<s> I propose the following rewording to the last two paragraphs of the Introduction (in response to Judy's comments).  </s>
<s> Somehow in the multiple re-edits we have blurred the distinction between making the tool accessible and making a tool that generates accessible content (note the sentence : "It does design issues directly related to accessible authoring tools, such as automation, accessibility checking, appropriate documentation,  </s>
<s> navigation mechanisms, prompts, the adoption of system conventions, and  </s>
<s> other features that will result in authoring tools which allow users to create accessible content regardless of disability.")  </s>
<s> Present wording is: An accessible authoring tool is accessible software that produces accessible content for the Web.  </s>
<s> For detailed information about the production of accessible content this document relies on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT].  </s>
<s> Similarly, this document does  </s>
<s> not directly address the general design of accessible software.  </s>
<s> It does design issues directly related to accessible authoring tools, such as  </s>
<s> automation, accessibility checking, appropriate documentation, navigation mechanisms, prompts, the adoption of system conventions, and other features that will result in authoring tools which allow users to create accessible content regardless of disability.  </s>
<s> Because most of the Web is created using authoring tools, they play a critical role in ensuring the accessibility of the web.  </s>
<s> A separate document, entitled Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility [WAI-AUTOOLS-TECH], provides suggestions and examples of how each checkpoint might be satisfied, It also includes references to other accessibility resources (such as platform-specific software accessibility guidelines) which give additional information on how a tool may satisfy each checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Readers are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the techniques document.  </s>
<s> Please note that while there may be many helpful suggestions there the requirements which need to be fulfilled are the checkpoints in this document, and ways other than those suggested may be appropriate for some tools.  </s>
<s> Proposed revision is: An accessible authoring tool is accessible software that produces accessible content for the Web.  </s>
<s> Thus the goals of this document can be stated as follows: that the authoring tool be accessible to authors regardless of disability, that the authoring tool generate accessible content by default, and that the authoring tool support and encourage the author in creating accessible content.  </s>
<s> Because most of the Web is created using authoring tools, they play a critical role in ensuring the accessibility of the Web.  </s>
<s> Since the Web is both a means of receiving information and communicating information, it is important that both the web content produced and the authoring tool itself be accessible.  </s>
<s> For detailed information about what constitutes accessible content this document relies on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT].  </s>
<s> The document provides guidelines for designing authoring tools that generate web content that conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and that support and encourage authors to create content that conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>

<s> Readers are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the techniques document.  </s>
<s> Please note that the techniques are merely suggested implementations of the checkpoints, alternative strategies may be used to meet the requirements of the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> End of revision As previously suggested I have included the goal statement and have addressed the awkward wording of the second paragraph.  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> I would suggest adding to the last sentence of the 1st paragraph  </s>
<s> such as conformance to accessible standards (i.e., HTML 4.0), accessibility checking and correcting, prompting, appropriate documentation and help, and navigation mechanisms.  </s>
<s> PJ: This is one of the "main" purposes and the majority of the "meat" of the document and should be briefly introduced in the introduction.(strikethrough:  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins  </s>
<s> Jutta, Thank you for the rewording, I think this is clearer and addresses several issues.  </s>
<s> I also agree with Phill's recommendation to add:  </s>
<s> In the interests of having the intro read as smoothly as possible for people who haven't been living &amp; breathing this, a few other very minor suggestions, if time allows: - break up the new first paragraph, right before "For detailed information about what constitutes accessible content..." so it's not so long to plow through; - at "Because most of the Web is created using authoring tools..." specify instead "Because most of the content of the Web is created using authoring tools..." since the Web also involves servers handling transport protocols; - change the "the" to "this" at "The document provides guidelines..." since, given the reference to WCAG at the end of the previous sentence, the reader at first assumes this is another reference to WCAG. - Judy  </s>

<s> Phil, The sentence you cite refers to making the tool accessible to authors with disabilities.  </s>
<s> The examples you cite refer to ensuring that the content created is accessible, with the exception of "navigation mechanisms."  </s>
<s> I take your point that we need to give examples of what we do include and taking Judy's comments as well I propose the following re-revision of the middle Introductory paragraph: Begin re-revision: An accessible authoring tool is accessible software that produces accessible content for the Web.  </s>

<s> The current re-rewording (or re-revision) of the "middle Introductory paragraph) gets my vote.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I received 3 comments from developers about the introduction/guidelines: Developer 1 said: The revision seems better to me.  </s>
<s> Developer 2 said: The logic of this sentence is mind boggling quote Since the Web is both a means of receiving information and communicating information, it is important that both the web content produced and the authoring tool itself be accessible.  </s>
<s> endquote.  </s>
<s> I think the sentence is constructed just to restate the accessible tool requirement and the same logic could be used to require engine maintenance courses for a drivers license.  </s>
<s> I want accessible tools too.  </s>
<s> But the overwhelming issue is accessible content.  </s>
<s> When the introduction does not give that impression, the introduction fails.  </s>
<s> The focus of *several* sentences is the accessibility of the tool.  </s>
<s> The first sentence, "accessible authoring tool..." - in common parlance that means software accessibility.  </s>
<s> The first goal is software accessibility.  </s>
<s> I claim the "communicating information" sentence is there for the purpose of accessible software.  </s>
<s> I much prefer the prior introduction wording.  </s>
<s> End Developer 2 Developer 3 said: Phill, The rewording is fine.  </s>
<s> However, I think the nature of the authoring tool guideline is too stringent.  </s>
<s> A tool can create accessible Web pages without being accessible itself.  </s>
<s> I thought the guideline was meant to dictate what a tool should create.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't the authoring tool requirements be evaluated separately?  </s>
<s> I agree that in an ideal world that all software would be accessible, but shouldn't we take it one step at a time?  </s>
<s> To ask a developer to put requirements into his/her software so the tool is creating accessible Web pages is only asking him/her to modify the features of the product.  </s>
<s> To ask a developer to make his/her software accessible may be asking for a total redesign of the tool itself.  </s>
<s> This is too much too soon.  </s>
<s> A guideline shouldn't overwhelm developers so much so that they decide it's all too much and do nothing at all.  </s>
<s> End Developer 3 These comments are being sent to the list as example of reaction to the Intro/guidelines.  </s>
<s> It's not necessary to discuss each comment and debate whether or not the developer got the "right impression".  </s>
<s> But their reaction should be taken into consideration in our decisions.  </s>
<s> More at the call Regards, Phill Jenkins 512-838-4517 Accessibility Program Manager  </s>
