<s> [Priority3] The effective requirement is probably close to what you are looking for, although you may be considering explaining to AU why this actually qualifies as more than beneficial - removing a significant barrier to accessibility, and thereby  </s>

<s> OK, there is no reqwuirement in ATAG that the information is tracked carefully, or is particularly helpful.  </s>
<s> And the requirement is P3.  </s>
<s> At that level of priority, the techniques become more like what people are actually going to do.  </s>
<s> In particular, the best technique for providing a summary is to track what has been done, including author-checked stuff (ATAG is pretty explicit that there are requirements for author-checking in some cases.  </s>
<s> In fact the minimum requirement is just to ask the author to check everything).  </s>
<s> The best technique would be to use an interoperable language for knowing this stuff.  </s>
<s> One option is to consider taking on the work of developing such a language as a W3C Recommendation - after all, it is a fairly small piece of technical work by comparison to things like SMIL.  </s>
<s> It just needs implementors...  </s>
<s> Alternatively, maybe we should just shoot for implementation, make a Note, and then think about where to go... Charles  </s>
