<s> Hi, Can anyone recommend or comment on the accessibility and usability of these three web mail applications.  </s>
<s> NeoMail SquirrelMail Horde They are used in so many places.  </s>
<s> I use Horde occassionally, which is used by my current ISP.  </s>
<s> I'm also interested in any type of feedback on these products, it would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> Geoff  </s>
<s> Our organization uses SquirrelMail for web-based access, and Eudora or desktop access to email.  </s>
<s> The only accessibility that I've checked out is the ability to TAB between elements on the screen, which it does nicely.  </s>
<s> It is pretty straight-forward and user-friendly.  </s>
<s> Even our not-so-tech-savvy staff have had very little difficulty using it.  </s>
<s> Janet  </s>
<s> Yes, this is the one that a few people have told me off list they find the best, with Neo coming a close second.  </s>
<s> Thanks Geoff  </s>
