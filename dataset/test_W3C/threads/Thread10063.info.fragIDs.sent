<s> [[Issue 1 - aboutEachPrefix I am told by Jeremy Carroll that this problem can be dealt with by Jena and modelled using OWL.  </s>
<s> The issue is why this is not something that a "basic" RDF processor should be able to deal with.  </s>
<s> In the aboutEachprefix case it was (theoretically) available in basic processors which did not implement other "optional" specifications.  </s>

<s> So it is a layering question, asking why is this not (no longer) in RDF.  </s>
<s> I think we had good feedback that it lived badly in RDF and as such was hardly implemented.  </s>
<s> It broke layering by looking inside URIs rather than dealing with identity, felt mor elik a RDF/XML syntax thing than part of the RDF model and as such it mixed badly with the triples model (and bagID - ha ha).  </s>
<s> I also quite like what Dan Brickley said during the RDF Core WG discussion: [[I for one will never enourage people to write down useful generalisations in aboutEach syntax, because I don't want to have them come back and ask me why those rules aren't accessible via the (graph-oriented) APIs, query languages, database interfaces etc that they'll have to use to access their content.  </s>
<s> In my experience of talking to RDF developers _and_ content producers, there's often misunderstanding about which features of the XML syntax are carried through to the abstract graph.  </s>
<s> So my problem with encouraging the use of aboutEach is that it risks creating a huge legacy problem: information loss as we go from the RDF/XML into databases, APIs etc.  </s>
<s> Because about aboutEach mechanism _appears_ to be RDF's way of making generalised claims about members of a collection, people will likely use it as such unless we attach a health warning.  </s>
<s> Once it becomes clear that aboutEach is just a wierd macro mechanism, I believe it'll lose its appeal to content producers.]] -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0532.html  </s>
<s> This comment isn't a proposal to change anything, just a question.  </s>
<s> How do you deal with such things?  </s>
<s> It doesn't fit into accept/reject/postpone.  </s>
<s> Picking one: reject, the reasons it was thrown out of RDF remain valid.  </s>
<s> Brian: please add this to the agenda for Friday  </s>

<s> Chas expresses the issue two ways: [[The first is the lack of a standardised "abouteachprefix" in RDF.]] and [[The issue is why this is not something that a "basic" RDF processor should be able to deal with.]]  </s>
<s> Processwise, I suggest we clarify this issue (as you have done) as: request that aboutEachPrefix be reinstated.  </s>
<s> Sure; please can we have proposed resolution text to consider.  </s>

<s> Brian McBride said:  </s>
<s> I propose that the WG reject chas-01 "request to add aboutEachPrefix" on the grounds that the original reasons for removal remain valid: * We had good feedback that it lived badly in RDF and as such was little implemented or used.  </s>
<s> * It broke layering by looking inside URIs rather than dealing with them as identifiers.  </s>
<s> * Felt more like a RDF/XML syntax thing than part of the RDF model and as such it mixed badly with triples.  </s>
<s> * Worked badly with rdf:bagID - the interactions were never well understood.  </s>
<s> * Experienced practitioners recommended against using it.  </s>
