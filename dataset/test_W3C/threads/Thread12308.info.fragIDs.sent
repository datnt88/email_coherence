<s> On the call it was suggested that there be a way to differentiate the checkpoint numbers of WCAG from those of ATAG and that is clearly necessary.  </s>
<s> One suggestion is to leave out the word "checkpoint" and designate them as "WCAG 3.1" or "ATAG 7.2".  </s>
<s> When "Reference:" is used under a checkpoint to WCAG it shouldn't be so general but should isolate where to look (I guess this has already been brought up but needs reinforcing) so that the "feel" intended for hyperlinks is evident.  </s>
<s> I don't know how practical this is since the target snippet would have to be marked and is beyond the control of this document.  </s>
<s> Maybe all the destinations could be gathered in one place to make this process work fast?  </s>
<s> The Sample under 1.1 shouldn't be a general statement - it *must* point to an actual sample.  </s>
<s> This should be true of all samples.  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> On the whole I would prefer real examples to fictional ones.  </s>
<s> In most cases there is a good real example of a technique (A-prompt may not be a complete solution, but it is an example of a number of techniques nonetheless).  </s>

<s> For the record, when I say "based on A-prompt" in my techniques piece, I usually mean I have modified the dialog from a correction configuration to a prompt configuration.  </s>
<s> However, sometimes the images are only A-prompt design ideas.  </s>
