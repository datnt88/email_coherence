<s> How is overflow to be handled during the computation of arithmetic functions?  </s>
<s> For example, on implementations that choose to limit the precision of xs:integer to (signed) 64 bit integers, should let $max_int := xs:integer("9223372036854775807") return avg(($max_int, $max_int)) succeed and return $max_int, fail with overflow, or is the behavior implementation-dependent/defined?  </s>

<s> I'm asking about builtin functions like avg().  </s>
<s> 6.2 just addresses the built-in operators like +, and nothing in the standard says that fn:sum() uses the same semantics as op:add().  </s>
<s> (Although avg() is defined to be sum() div count().)  </s>
<s> Also, I'm asking whether overflow occurs, not how the implementation is required to handle it when it does.  </s>
<s> On an implementation that chooses limited precision, is ($max_int + $max_int)/2 allowed to return $max_int or must it overflow?  </s>
<s> If 6.2 answers this, it's not obvious.  </s>
<s> It's ok, it's not an important question.  </s>
