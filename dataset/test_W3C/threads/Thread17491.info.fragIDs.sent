<s> (AOLAccessibility@aol.com) and received the bounced message below.  </s>
<s> Apparently, AOL access is not functioning either as an e-mail address or as a company concept.  </s>
<s> Its new media player does not have a means to control volume that is accessible to the blind.  </s>
<s> it is controlled using a slide bar and mouse  </s>
<s> only.  </s>
<s> I do know that the aolaccessibility@aol.com address is still functioning.  </s>
<s> I don't know why your message bounced, but I know from my contact at AOL that they are aware of the issue that you raise and I'm cc'ing them on this message so they can contact you directly.  </s>
<s> I dont know about the email address and if AOL is aware of the issue and is working on it or not...  </s>
<s> I am taking your word for it.  </s>
<s> Keyboard and screen reader control of embedded media players is uniformly poor, and this version of the aol media player is no exception.  </s>
<s> The Quicktime player, when embedded will allow some control of the media player controls (volume, next/previous song, etc.), but no embedded player gives the same level of control as the standalone version of the same player.  </s>
<s> Why not?  </s>
<s> It is not good enough to say dont worry about it because that is the way they all are (inaccessible).  </s>
<s> And Kelly is trying to alert AOL of  </s>
<s> IT'S inaccessible embedded media player.  </s>
<s> What you wrote here gives the  </s>
<s> feeling that since noone has attempted to fix the problem, it is ok to be inaccessible until one (or more) comes along that is accessible.  </s>
<s> This way of thinking (whether or not you meant it that way) is one reason most of  </s>
<s> the web is still inaccessible and businesses not moving to rectify it.  </s>
<s> If everyone else is not accessible, then why should I bother until I am in the minority.  </s>
<s> And with the majority thinking that way, accessiblity will not be an important issue with them.  </s>
<s> I know AOL will be interested in hearing your observations and wishes, but you might also want to raise the issue with the radio station that is using the player and ask that they provide a link to open the stream in a standalone player.  </s>
<s> Very good point!  </s>
<s> I agree that this is an issue that should be addressed, and the fact that other embedded players doesn't provide justification for the inaccessibility of the media player, but I don't think that a blanket dismissal of AOL's accessibility efforts is appropriate.  </s>
<s> I have a problem here.... dissmissal no, but if it is inaccessible on one thing... it is STILL inaccessible.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure where you're reading me stating that this is a non-issue that shouldn't be worried about.  </s>
<s> In fact, I state the exact opposite a couple of paragraphs down.  </s>
<s> I wrote, "the fact that other embedded players doesn't provide justification for the inaccessibility of the media player".  </s>
<s> Kelly is welcome to alert AOL, and he should do so.  </s>
<s> He has brought up many excellent points about access issues that I have seen.  </s>
<s> The feeling you describe is not what I was trying to convey.  </s>
<s> You're applying a bias to my words that is not supported by the actual words I wrote.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> That mindset, which neither I nor the my contacts at AOL hold, does impede progress.  </s>
<s> In any large organization you are bound to have people that are at either end of the spectrum.  </s>
<s> I agree that this is an issue that should be addressed, and the fact that other embedded players doesn't provide justification for the inaccessibility of the media player, but I don't think that  </s>
<s> a blanket  </s>
<s> dismissal of AOL's accessibility efforts is appropriate.  </s>
<s> The player is not accessible and there is no good justification.  </s>
<s> However, AOL does a lot more than provide a version of the WinAMP player that is embedded in Web pages.  </s>
<s> To state that "AOL access is not functioning...as a company concept" is unnecessarily inflammatory and doesn't accurately reflect AOL's ongoing work addressing accessibility in its products.  </s>

<s> Ok, I am not picking on Mr. Kirkpatrick or trying to start a flame.  </s>
<s> I am making a point to all to watch what they say in a public forum where businesses can use the words (albeit out of context maybe) by accessiblity advocates against their (our) cause.  </s>
<s> Here is an example of what I mean:  </s>
<s> Me (a made up lawyer for a made up company who is going to court to fight an accessiblity issue that they dont want to be bothered with): I call Mr. Kirkpatrick to the stand.  </s>
<s> Me: Mr. Kirkpatrick are you a member of WAI and an established expert in web accessibility?  </s>
<s> Mr. Kirkpatrick: yes Me: Mr. Kirkpatrick did you say this (refer to the previous message about all embedded media players) Mr. Kirkpatrick: but... Me: Yes or no please.  </s>
<s> Mr. Kirkpatrick: Yes Me: Was this the exact statement of everything in the paragraph?  </s>
<s> Yes or No? Mr. Kirkpatrick: Yes Me: Thank You Me: (to the court) I rest my case Is this cheesy?  </s>
<s> yes.  </s>
<s> But it is done and done very well to get their point accross.  </s>
<s> It makes it look like WAI agrees with their side.  </s>
<s> Now I, being  </s>
<s> in the Washington DC area, have seen this tack employed far too often.  </s>
<s> Andrew, I know you did not intend it to be read like that.  </s>
<s> And I am truly sorry that your message was the first that I saw since I took an active interest advocating the web accessiblity issue.  </s>
<s> I am just doing a service to all whose job it is to advocate web accessibility.  </s>
<s> It is definately not personal and I look forward to working with you and everyone on this list to make the web accessible to ALL! -Steve  </s>
<s> This exchange between me and a lawyer who is trying to use one sentence out of several in an email assumes that the lawyer on the other side is completely incompetent.  </s>
<s> It is true that most embedded media players are largely inaccessible to keyboard and screen reader users, and I would be dishonest to say anything else.  </s>
<s> Part of the entire message is that this is no excuse.  </s>
<s> I wrote that at the outset, and a qualified plaintiff's attorney would draw that out if I was forced to answer a misleading question with a yes or no answer.  </s>
<s> AWK  </s>
