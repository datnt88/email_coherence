<s> This is a brief final review of *all* the RDF Core documents (not just the Primer) as of the CVS versions indicated.  </s>
<s> I note that *all* the documents now have the same SOTD, which means that *none* of the documents are explicitly indicated as being normative (see below).  </s>
<s> There are also a few other issues in some of the documents that may or may not be considered problematic.  </s>
<s> Primer Rec CVS 1.44  </s>
<s> All the SOTD and References look OK now.  </s>
<s> The Change Log is OK.  </s>
<s> Section 7.2 of the Primer, in describing Test Cases, says "The test cases are not a complete specification of RDF, and are not intended to take precedence over the normative specification documents."  </s>
<s> On thinking about the discussion on the meaning of "normative" earlier last week, I suppose someone could read this as saying that Test Cases is *not* normative.  </s>
<s> If that's a concern, simply changing this to: "The test cases are not a complete specification of RDF, and are not intended to take precedence over the *other* specification documents."  </s>
<s> would be a simple fix.  </s>
<s> Leaving this alone doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother anyone else.  </s>
<s> Concepts Rec CVS 1.70 SOTD: This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer; there is nothing here that indicates the normative status of the Concepts spec.  </s>
<s> All the links and other material seem OK. References: seem OK In the Change Log, under "References", there's a "TODO" at the end.  </s>
<s> To reduce confusion, this should probably either be done or removed.  </s>
<s> Semantics Rec CVS 1.69 SOTD: This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer; there is nothing here that indicates the normative status of the Semantics spec.  </s>
<s> All the links and other material seem OK. References: seem OK  </s>

<s> There is also an Appendix B, "Open Issues" that has a bullet "complete the test cases", which suggests the Test Cases document is not complete.  </s>
<s> This should probably be deleted (both here and in the Table of Contents).  </s>

<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> Thanks for the careful review, Frank.  </s>
<s> As I understand the process, these kinds of changes are made (at this point, after PR) at the discretion of the Director, rather than by WG decision.  </s>
<s> However, it would be good to know if anyone on the WG sees any problem with any of these changes.  </s>
<s> They all seem good to me, except the idea that the SOTD should say something about normativity.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, to the extent that normativity is conveyed explicitely, it should be in the document main text, or in parenthetical expressions on the section titles.  </s>
<s> And that kind of change is potentially substantive, and so not appropriate here and now.  </s>
<s> I like this change.  </s>
<s> I like this change.  </s>
<s> I'm ambivalent on this.  </s>
<s> There's not wrong with listing old changes, although they are a bit of clutter.  </s>
<s> Ambivalent, ditto old changes.  </s>

<s> -- sandro  </s>
<s> Sandro-- The reason I mentioned the "normative" business was that at one point the second sentence in the SOTD of the documents said "It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another document."  </s>
<s> (This seems to be standard boilerplate for other W3C normative specifications as well.)  </s>
<s> There was also a statement above that for translations that said that the English translation was the normative one.  </s>
<s> I think these sentences were removed as a result of my pointing out that the Primer wasn't normative.  </s>
<s> However, it seems to me that they *are* appropriate for the other documents.  </s>
<s> However, it's really not a big concern to me.  </s>
<s> I was just pointing out that some changes that were appropriate for the Primer  </s>
<s> seemed to be carried over to the other documents as well, and I wondered whether that was intentional.  </s>
<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> snip  </s>
<s> That's OK with me.  </s>
<s> I have to say, though, that a lot of the email traffic having to do with getting the Recs finalized could have been eliminated if the Editors (or at least *this* Editor) had been better informed as to what was going on.  </s>
<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> Thanks for catching that - I can't remember what was todo, but either it ot done or it didn't!  </s>
