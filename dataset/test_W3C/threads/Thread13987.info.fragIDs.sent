<s> Chuck, Gregg, and Wendy Five significant changes to the page author guidelines since December.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> A few of the early sections of the HTML 4.0 recommendation were reorganized into one fewer section (reduced from 25 total to 24).  </s>
<s> We updated the master document to reflect the changes by renumbering effected sections and updating the names of the place-holders.  </s>
<s> 2. Added to the section on Frames: [Recommended] Provide descriptions of the layout and purpose of frames and how multiple frames relate to each other.  </s>
<s> [New] Use the "longdesc" attribute on FRAME and IFRAME elements to link to a page with descriptions.  </s>
<s> 3. Added to the section on Forms: [Recommended] For long lists of selections, group items into a hierarchy.  </s>
<s> [New] In the near future, browsers will display grouped lists with expanding and collapsing levels of detail.  </s>
<s> To group items, use OPTGROUP elements with a SELECT element, such as: OPTION label="3.7.1" value="pm3_3.7.1" PortMaster 3 with ComOS 3.7.1  </s>
<s> OPTION label="3.7"  </s>
<s> value="pm3_3.7"  </s>
<s> PortMaster 3 with ComOS 3.7 OPTION label="3.5"  </s>
<s> value="pm3_3.5"  </s>
<s> PortMaster 3 with ComOS 3.5 OPTION label="3.7"  </s>
<s> value="pm2_3.7"  </s>
<s> PortMaster 2 with ComOS 3.7 OPTION label="3.5"  </s>
<s> value="pm2_3.5"  </s>
<s> PortMaster 2 with ComOS 3.5 OPTION label="3.7R"  </s>
<s> value="IRX_3.7R"  </s>
<s> IRX with ComOS 3.7R OPTION label="3.5R"  </s>
<s> value="IRX_3.5R"  </s>
<s> IRX with ComOS 3.5R **Note - the next two items were added to the "Tips and tricks for more accessible design" section of the author guidelines and checklist, but we are not sure where they fit in the master document.  </s>
<s> It might be best to move them into "Good web site design practices."  </s>
<s> 4. Added to the Tips and Tricks section (no ratings for this section) * Create a single downloadable file for documents that exist as a series of separate pages.  </s>
<s> This facilitates people reading documents off-line.  </s>
<s> Currently, an archival or compression program is needed to create the single file.  </s>
<s> In the near future, user agents will be able to collate separate pages based on information in page headers.  </s>
<s> The following example shows how to indicate where the first page of the reference manual exists as well as which page follows the current one.  </s>
<s> link rel="Start" title="The first page of the manual" type="text/html" href="http://someplace.com/manual/start.html"  </s>
<s> link rel="Next" title="Chapter 2" type="text/html" href="http://someplace.com/manual/ch2.html" 5. Added to the Tips and Tricks section (no ratings for this section) * Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. to decrease the amount of sifting readers perform to find important information.  </s>
<s> This is commonly referred to as "front-loading" and is especially helpful for people accessing information serially.  </s>
