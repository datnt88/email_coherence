<s> In trying to make the OWL semantics correspond to the RDF  </s>
<s> semantics I came  </s>
<s> up with the following problems in RDF datatyping: 1/ A datatype is an element of IR, because the RDF MT says  </s>
<s> that datatypes are  </s>
<s> denoted by URI references.  </s>
<s> However, rdf:XMLLiteral is said to be a datatype, but rdf:XMLLiteral is a URI reference.  </s>
<s> Something  </s>
<s> is wrong here.  </s>
<s> rdf:XMLLiteral denotes the datatype.  </s>
<s> It is not itself the datatype.  </s>
<s> It is a URIref.  </s>
<s> 2/ XSD-interpretations include in their datatypes the XML  </s>
<s> Schema datatypes  </s>
<s> that are problematic when removed from XML documents or have other problems.  </s>
<s> XSD-interpretations also include, for example,  </s>
<s> the datatype  </s>
<s> named FOO, which is not defined as an XML datatype.  </s>
<s> I'm not really sure what your saying here.  </s>
<s> I'm not aware of any XML Schema datatype that does not conform to the definition of rdfs:Datatype.  </s>
<s> Can you be more specific?  </s>
<s> 3/ A datatype has to be more than is specified in the RDF  </s>
<s> MT. Except for  </s>
<s> XSD-interpretations, which explicitly mention the  </s>
<s> URI-reference to datatype  </s>
<s> relationship, there is no way of tying the intended  </s>
<s> URI-reference for a  </s>
<s> datatype to that datatype.  </s>
<s> For example, if I have D  </s>
<s> containing a datatype  </s>
<s> for integers and a datatype for strings, there is no way to  </s>
<s> require that a  </s>
<s> particular URI reference, say ex:int, denotes the integer datatype.  </s>
<s> It probably makes more sense to say that a datatype is a four-tuple, consisting of a URI reference, a lexical space, a value space, and a lexical-to-value mapping.  </s>
<s> This doesn't make sense to me.  </s>
<s> A URIref is a name.  </s>
<s> It denotes  </s>
<s> something.  </s>
<s> A name is not part of the thing it denotes.  </s>
<s> It is fully concievable that there can be multiple URIrefs that denote the same datatype, just as there can be e.g. multiple URIrefs that denote the city of Paris, France.  </s>
<s> A URIref denoting the city of Paris is not part of the city of Paris.  </s>
<s> Further, one can use OWL mechanisms to express such equality  </s>
<s> of denotation if in fact multiple URIrefs denote the same datatype.  </s>
<s> I would consider the inclusion of the URIref as part of the datatype definition a mistake.  </s>
<s> Regards, Patrick  </s>
<s> If that's the case (and your position seems reasonable) then I don't see that we have any choice but to include the language tag contents in the L2V mapping for all datatypes, OR to drop it from XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> The reason why PFPS was suggesting that the URIRef be made a part of the datatype definition was (as far as I can tell) so that we can ensure  </s>
<s> XMLLiteral gets a separate treatment.  </s>
<s> I would much rather remove this - clearly awkward - special case and give a regular treatment to all datatypes.  </s>

<s> I would drop it from XMLLiteral, as I've proposed many times before.  </s>
<s> The fact that the RDF/XML serialization can "infect" what is essentially an XML fragment taken in isolation (and not relevant or part of an RDF/XML serialization -- i.e. not constituting any RDF statements -- is IMO a bug in the original M&amp;S and should be fixed.  </s>
<s> If one has an XML literal and one wishes to specify xml:lang for that literal, then fine, do so, *in* the literal.  </s>
<s> Having the RDF/XML context "leak" into the XML literal makes RDF far more cumbersome to use for modular content management.  </s>
<s> I fully agree.  </s>
<s> A third option is to back up a bit and not treat XML literals as typed literals and not define any datatype rdfs:XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> I.e., back to when we had three kinds of literals: plain, typed, and XML.  </s>
<s> But I'd rather see the semantic significance of xml:lang for XML literals removed as it is for all typed literals.  </s>
<s> Question: are there *any* existing implementations which rely on xml:lang defined at higher scope in the RDF/XML serialization for the proper interpretattion/processing of XML literals?  </s>
