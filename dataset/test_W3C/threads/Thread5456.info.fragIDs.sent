<s> Hi: Note that in Sect 6.1 the following reference under [IANASchemes] is to a self-confessed retired page: "Dan Connolly's list of URI schemes is a useful resource for finding out which references define various URI schemes."  </s>
<s> Would it be appropriate to distingush between normative and non-normative (i.e. informative) references?  </s>
<s> If so, then the following would be an example  </s>
<s> of a normative reference "IANA's online registry of URI Schemes is available at while the Connolly resource (were it not retired) would be an informative reference.  </s>

<s> Tony,  </s>
<s> For the moment, we don't distinguish between normative/informative references because there is no conformance to this document.  </s>
<s> I think that the current organization of the references may be confusing.  </s>
<s> We do intend to have a list of architectural references (6.2).  </s>
<s> Section 6.1 used to be the list of normative references, but then we eliminated conformance.  </s>
<s> "Internet Specifications" is not a useful title for 6.1.  </s>
<s> My sense (this morning) is that we should have two lists: a) References b) Architectural References Thoughts?  </s>

<s> Hmm - good point.  </s>
<s> Was just mindful that DanC had mothballed that URI web page (and also traded it in for a newer 'sexed-up' wiki model).  </s>
<s> And then looking at the document I kind of wondered what a new reader would make of it all.  </s>
<s> No distinction between REC, CR, WIP, etc.  </s>
<s> They would all pass themselves off as authoritative.  </s>
<s> Whereas some docs have received considerable scrutiny.  </s>
<s> Though as you say, there is no conformance requirements.  </s>
<s> Your suggestion looks interesting and I will noodle on it.  </s>
<s> Perhaps useful to relegate the Internet side of things to a general infrastructural level.  </s>
