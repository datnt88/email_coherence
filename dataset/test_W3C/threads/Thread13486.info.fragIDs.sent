<s> Hello - I've been looking through this mailing list archives about EARL.  </s>
<s> It seems that it is what we might adopt in our project.  </s>
<s> That is generating an output from Bobby and HTML Validator that can be machine readable (like stored in a database and so on ...).  </s>
<s> So far I know that I need to read about XML, RDF and Notation 3. I have a little knowledge of XML but that's all !  </s>
<s> I don't have to much time, so could anyone tell me where can I find some documentation about it ?  </s>
<s> I know that on the W3C web site are a lot of recommendations and I have been using the ones referring to HTML and CSS and I think that they are great (structure and content).  </s>
<s> So if u could tell me exactly which one should I read it would be WONDERFUL !  </s>
<s> :) Thanks a lot - Carmen  </s>
<s> Hi, You don't need to know anything about N3 unless you want to read the eamples that we swap in email - it is just a form of RDF that is easy to write by hand.  </s>
<s> What you need is to understand RDF model (the concept part of the RDF Model and Syntax specification) - http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax - and the EARL properties and model - http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl - and look through the examples to see what needs to be generated (at the moment - we are still using a draft, and might change the vocabulary when we have more implementation experience).  </s>
<s> There are a bunch of tools around that can do things like manipulating and storing RDF (EARL is an RDF vocabulary, and not a very big one) - information is available from the RDF page - http://www.w3.org/RDF/ (at least I think that is enough) Can you tell us a bit more about the project?  </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply !  </s>
<s> I am a postgraduate student and I am doing my masters in Web Accessibility in R.I.N.C.E. - D.C.U. (Research Institute for Networks and Communications Engineering - Dublin City University) We are 2 students working on this research project.  </s>
<s> A part of this project is to see the accessibility of some web sites in Ireland.  </s>
<s> Well... now we are more concerned about our university web site !  </s>
<s> :)) We are using Bobby and HTML Validator to test the web sites.  </s>
<s> And we have to keep evidence of all these reports.  </s>
<s> Now I am trying to find a way to make a script (or more) to do that.  </s>
<s> I saw the mails about EARL and I thought that it sounds good.  </s>
<s> I'll start looking on the references that you sent me.  </s>
<s> Thanks again for them.  </s>
