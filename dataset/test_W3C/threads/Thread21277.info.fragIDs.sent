<s> Help! The Amaya Documentation says something like "We'll explain later how users can create their own types."  </s>
<s> I can't find this explanation, or work out what to do.  </s>

<s> Hello Tim,  </s>
<s> You're right.  </s>
<s> We haven't yet updated this part of the doc, but the work to do is quite easy.  </s>
<s> First some info...  </s>
<s> The annotation and annotation types RDF schemata are currently stored in the Amaya/config directory under the names annotschema.rdf and annottypes.rdf.  </s>
<s> As we can't yet dynamically download schemas from the web, we have another file called annot.schemas that tells Amaya the filenames where we stored the annotation schemas.  </s>
<s> This file is also under Amaya/config/  </s>
<s> Now, if you want to add new annotation types, you'll need to define their namespace and write their schema.  </s>
<s> This is quite easy.  </s>
<s> Let's do a new namespace called MyTypes.  </s>
<s> I add the following line to the end of annot.schemas:  </s>
<s> Then I'll add a new annotation type called "kudos" in mytypes.rdf:  </s>
<s> rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"  </s>
<s> And that's all.  </s>
<s> Next time I launch Amaya, I'll see the new Kudos annotation type.  </s>
<s> Look at the annottypes.rdf  </s>
<s> file to see other examples.  </s>
<s> As you can see, Amaya is not yet able to download schemata dynamically from the Web.  </s>
<s> For Amaya to understand the semantics of Kudos (the label in this case), the schema has to be stored in the Amaya/config directory.  </s>
<s> If this were not the case, then Amaya would have shown the URL of the property when browsing annotations of this type.  </s>
<s> It wouldn't have been possible to create such a type with Amaya either.  </s>
<s> These are things we need to further develop.  </s>
<s> Tell us if you have any problems or other questions.  </s>
<s> -jose  </s>
<s> Some further clarification: Amaya does not yet dynamically load RDF schemas from the Web.  </s>
<s> It loads only the schemas listed in Amaya/config/annot.schemas (SMOC - small matter of coding).  </s>
<s> But Amaya will load schemas from the Web if annot.schemas tells it to do so.  </s>
<s> For the two namespaces copy of the schemas.  </s>
<s> These are the first two files Jose is referring to.  </s>
<s> It is legitimate to cache a copy of an RDF Schema as http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327 says that once you publish a namespace name you should not change the contents of the namespace.  </s>
<s> note that, per the comments in annot.schemas, if you just put (without a second field) into that file then Amaya will attempt to read the schema from the Web.  </s>
<s> -Ralph  </s>
<s> Dear Colleagues,  </s>
<s> Thank you for your advice.  </s>
<s> I followed it, I thought correctly, but when I relaunched Amaya, the annotation type list was unchanged.  </s>
<s> This is how my copy of annot.schemas  </s>
<s> (in Amaya/config) now reads: # annot.schemas  </s>
<s> # specifies the RDF schemas to be pre-loaded for Annotations # each line beginning with '#' is a comment # all other non-empty lines must be in one of two formats: # 1. namespacename # 2. namespacename filename # In case 1, an RDF schema is expected to be found at the namespace URI # In case 2, the filename is expected to be a (local) copy of an RDF # schema for the namespace.  </s>
<s> The strings $THOTDIR and # $APP_HOME may be used at the beginning of the filename # and will be expanded to the Amaya installation directory # and the user's amaya home directory respectively.  </s>
<s> # Historical schema presented at WWW9.  </s>
<s> Obsolete.  </s>
<s> #http://www.w3.org/1999/xx/annotation-ns# #first release schema; do not change unless you also change the service #some Annotation subclasses that we think will be useful #a new namespace called "MyTypes" This is how mytypes.rdf now reads (in the same directory): rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" rdfs:seeAlso resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/Collaboration/Annotation/papers"/ rdfs:comment A class of Annotations representing glosses on vocabulary and usage /rdfs:comment rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/ Note: I initially wrote the antepenultimate line (and the fourth line before that) as in your example, namely: and respectively.  </s>
<s> When this didn't work, I tried the modifications indicated, not knowing exactly what I was doing!  </s>
<s> I expect that I have missed something obvious, and would be grateful for your advice.  </s>
