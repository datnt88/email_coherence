<s> We've been discussing how to transform languages into XML form so we can use XPointer in our evaluation descriptions of them.  </s>
<s> I took an action item to propose a generic way to convert any language expressed in Backus Naur Form (BNF).  </s>
<s> See e.g. [1] for a BNF tutorial.  </s>
<s> I propose an XML application with just three tags "rule" and "terminal" correspond to BNF rule and terminal symbols (what else?).  </s>
<s> We could get by without cdata, but then all the terminals would be individual characters.  </s>
<s> This is a shortcut to avoid that level of detail.  </s>
<s> Lets jump to an example.  </s>
<s> Here's a simple unix-like command sort +increasing -unique phonebook BNF for this sort of command is as follows.  </s>
<s> (I use the following BNF notation: Unquoted strings are rules.  </s>
<s> Quoted strings and characters are terminals.  </s>
<s> * means 0 or more.  </s>
<s> means "or".  </s>
<s> Brackets [] enclose prose definitions.  </s>
<s> command ::= command-name (argument)* filename command-name ::= "sort" | "print"| "mail" argument ::= prefix argument-name argument-name ::= "increasing" | "unique" prefix ::= '+' | '-' filename = [any sequence of alpha characters] Using the BNF to parse the example "sort" command, which I repeat here for convenience, sort +increasing -unique phonebook we get: Note that if you just scan down and read the terminal and cdata tags, you reconstruct the original unparsed data.  </s>
<s> So it's simple to see where you are in the raw input stream.  </s>
<s> And, if you go up the XML tree, you unwrap the production rules that were involved in the parse.  </s>
<s> In other words, this is a just an XML version of the parse tree.  </s>
<s> So in principle we've got a way to represent CSS, ECMAScript, C++, Java, Cobal, ADA, anything that can be specified by BNF.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> Is there an BNF for HTML?  </s>
<s> So... comments anyone?  </s>
<s> Any yacc gurus out there who'd like to implement this?  </s>
<s> Len p.s. I did a quick look around w3c and google and didn't find anything like this, but I expect that other folks have been thinking along the same  </s>
<s> lines.  </s>
<s> If anyone knows of something like this, please post it, especially  </s>
<s> if they already have the converter coded up!  </s>

<s> BNF describes the grammar for a language.  </s>
<s> So if you have a BNF, and an example of something written in that language, you can hunt out each thing and say what kind of object it is, and away you go with your conversion... (more or less) This seems like a very cool thing to do.  </s>
<s> For converting bad HTML to XML I still suggest that we call Tidy our algroithm, and then point out that it is already implemented.  </s>
<s> The problem is that most programmers get things more or less into the right syntax - most HTML coders (including those using tools to do it for them) more or less don't.  </s>
<s> So it won't amtch a BNF description in the first place.  </s>
