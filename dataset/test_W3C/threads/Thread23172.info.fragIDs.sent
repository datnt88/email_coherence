<s> It depends upon whether a level 1 or a level 2 method is called.  </s>
<s> For level 1 methods, the qualified name is used.  </s>
<s> For level 2 methods, the localName ane namespaceURI.  </s>
<s> This means that, depending upon whether a level 1 or a level 1 method was called, a different node may be replaced when setting an attribute.  </s>
<s> This is why it is important that after the document is created in normalized form where both the qualified name and the localName/namespaceURI is unique (usually by a parser) you should only use level 1 or level 2 methods in your application -- not both as some people try to keep suggesting.  </s>
<s> This means that if you ever use namespaces, you should never use level 1 methods which have been superseded, even for those things which do not have a namespace.  </s>
<s> Instead you should use level 2 methods passing a null namespaceURI if there is no namespace.  </s>

<s> Hi !! Here's my query!!! ........Can somebody help me out on this.......???  </s>
<s> In DOM specification, an element's NamedNodeMap contains its attribute nodes.  </s>
<s> In DOM level 1,we use setNamedItem to retrieve a node from NamedNodeMap by its name.  </s>
<s> In DOM level 2 the setNamedItemNS method is used..., I wanted to know ....What should be the lookup key used to retrieve from NamedNodeMap?  </s>
<s> Is it qualifiedName (two-part name containing prefix and localName) or two-part name containing localName and namespaceURI?  </s>
<s> thanx in advance, regards Thara  </s>
<s> What should be the lookup key used to retrieve from NamedNodeMap?  </s>
<s> As a DOM implementer you have to support both: For getNamedItemNS(), the key is the localname and namespace URI.  </s>
<s> For getNamedItem(), the key is the qualified name.  </s>
<s> This provides backward compatability for DOM Level 1 applications.  </s>
