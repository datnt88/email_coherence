<s> At the meeting in LA last week a new accessibility problem was announced called browser sniffing.  </s>
<s> Browser sniffing is done by a Web server to determine what browser requested information and denying information if you are not an approved browser.  </s>
<s> This is a problem since many browsers used by persons with disabilities are not "approved" by these servers.  </s>
<s> The practice seems to orginate by organizations (like banks) concerned about security and limiting the site to browsers that support secure transations.  </s>
<s> The current method of sniffing does not really detect if a browser supports secure transactions, it mainly just wants to know if you are netscape navigator or microsoft explorer.  </s>
<s> So even if your browser can handle secure transactions, the serve will ignore the request.  </s>
<s> Main questions for the user agent group is: Is this an issue the user agent working group wants to deal with?  </s>
<s> If so what do we want to do?  </s>
<s> How many people in the current working group are familiar with this problem and the technical issues surrounding it?  </s>

<s> I have a question/quiry and a thought.  </s>
<s> is this not a server issue? the server through a "script" that examines where a user is coming from gets the user agent information and decides what to do with it.  </s>
<s> this is most likely similar to deciding to put up those nasty messages like "you're browser is not frames capable, download this or that browser and try again".  </s>
<s> or you are not using xxx shame on you. is there a group in the wai that handles server issues?  </s>
<s> here's the thought.  </s>
<s> in our ua guidelines, we can have a list of browsers that support security and hope/ask servers to allow them.  </s>

<s> In response to David Poehlman, Broswer sniffing is a server issue, and I think WAI will bring it up with the server people at W3C.  </s>
<s> I think in general W3C is against browser sniffing, but it not clear what power they have to stop it.  </s>
<s> Do you think it is something UA should be dealing with and make a statement?  </s>

<s> Jon, I think a request that if it is used it should be used judiciously is in order.  </s>
<s> if a browser is truly insecure than I under stand partially the point.  </s>
<s> if it is being uused to deny fredom of information than that is something else again and should be garded against.  </s>
<s> I guess we could tell user agents how to break it.  </s>
<s> it can be a simple trick to fool a site that looks at the user agent into passing your browser by falsifying the user agent.  </s>
<s> not all browsers can do this, but some can.  </s>

<s> I was attempting to remember the part this played in a discussion we had some time back.  </s>
<s> browser snipping was a part of a new set of capabilities.  </s>

<s> As a browser developer we must say that browser sniffing is a problem.  </s>
<s> The result is that we need to say that we are Netscape to get pages that are ok or even get pages at all in some cases.  </s>
<s> What would have been much better is to be able to ask for pages using a system where you say whether the browser and user want certain things such as - frames - tables - java - javascript - images This allows the page designer to take these things into consideration and deliver an optimal page.  </s>
<s> Sadly, some of them will just say "turn on feature X".  </s>

<s> JRG in response to Jon S. von Tetzchner: What do you think WAI or W3C should do about this?  </s>
<s> Should WAI make a statement against any use of sniffing?  </s>
<s> Should sniffing be done on technical merits of a browsers features and not it's developers name?  </s>

<s> I really think W3C should get involved.  </s>
<s> I think that getting rid of browser sniffing will be very difficult, but I agree that it should be based on what the browser/user can handle and not on the type of browser.  </s>
<s> This would allow designers to make pages that fit the user, no matter which browser s/he is using.  </s>
