<s> ref: http://www.abou-zahra.net/shadi/w3c/wrapper/outline.html here are some comments i have about EARL: 1. EARL versions  </s>
<s> considering the fact that there are already two versions of EARL, a  </s>
<s> dedicated earl:version attribute would be very helpful so that a  </s>
<s> consumer tool can determine if it has the capability to process the  </s>
<s> input.  </s>
<s> currently the only possibility is to look at the namespace value  </s>
<s> but in my opinion that is a hack.  </s>
<s> 2. location specification even though the earl:subject attribute might describe a tested DOM *element* fairly well (eg.  </s>
<s> "http://www.example.org/page.html#html[1]/body[2]/img[1]"),  </s>
<s> in many cases a cursor to the specific location within a *file* (eg.  </s>
<s> earl:cursor row="23" col="15"/ ) might be more appropriate, for example  </s>
<s> if the consumer is an authoring tool that needs to point an end user to  </s>
<s> that location.  </s>
<s> 3. test case nesting  </s>
<s> having child/parent relationships for test cases might be very helpful  </s>
<s> in understanding the assertions and possibly making a judgment on severity and importance of a failure or success.  </s>
<s> for the tool i am trying to build such a description would also allow me to align assertions conducted by different assertors without getting into any tools specifics.  </s>
<s> 4. multiple messages  </s>
<s> an assertor might have a lot to say about a conducted test but not  </s>
<s> everything might be equally important to the end user depending on their  </s>
<s> role. being able to tag an earl:massage with a priority or similar might  </s>
<s> be useful for flexibility.  </s>
<s> to put it all together, here is what my imaginary EARL code would look like: earl:subject rdf:resource="http://www.example.org/page.html#html[1]/body[2]/img[1]"  </s>
<s> earl:message priority="2" hint: it looks like the element is missing its closing brace /earl:note earl:test-type ns="&amp;wcag;/standardtypes/html" earl:parent-test-type ns="&amp;wcag;/standardtypes/html" earl:related-test-type ns="&amp;wcag;/standardtypes/html" earl:related-test-type ns="&amp;wcag;/standardtypes/wai" regards, shadi  </s>
<s> Comments inline - quick summary: version is not necessary, different location specifiers are required but should be in RDF, not extra properties for line/column, line/col is the least accurate reference over time, test-case nesting is critical but maybe doesn't belong in the EARL spec itself, you can already put complex annotations into an earl:note so priority isn't a particular need.  </s>
<s> I don't think this is a hack, because the EARL namespaces identify each version differently - this is therefore providing some identifier for the given version, in line with the use of namespaces in XML and RDF.  </s>
<s> Which is, IMHO, better than adding a version property to an EARL assertion.  </s>
<s> This was discussed some time ago, and I was under the impression that the subject would be expected to be RDF - this allows for it to be a single RDF resource such as an Xpointer, some RDF that refers to a line/character offset (Hisoft do this in their AccVerify EARL reports), a more complex kind of pointer such as a fuzzy pointer, or something that says "the tool whose homepage is http://example.org/authTool".  </s>
<s> Providing just a line/character offset is the least stable way to refer to something, since many authoring tools change these even without changing the document - just by allowing for a human-readable source view.  </s>
<s> Conversely they are the easiest to generate from an Xpointer or similar, which specifies more than just the starting point.  </s>
<s> In the authoring tool case being able to track something over changes in the page is particularly important, so stability is desirable.  </s>
<s> There is a discussion that took place some time ago about various techniques for doing this, but I don't have a pointer handy.  </s>
<s> I don't recall if this is in the spec, but we have certainly discussed this  </s>
<s> as a requirement - for example at the Bristol face to face meeting.  </s>
<s> It may be  </s>
<s> that these were defined utside the specification - for example I think the RDF information about WCAG that is used in the MUTAT sample claims that certain test (e.g. WCAG level A conformance) can be determined heurisitcally based on other tests (in this case all the priority one WCAG checkpoints) which may themselves each be determined by several tests (there are several tests available for WCAG1 checkpoint 1.1 in AERT that all need to be met or not applicable in order to assert conformance to the checkpoint).  </s>
<s> This appraoch is also important for testing WCAG and section 508 - a number of the same tests are used and some different ones.  </s>
<s> It would be worthwhile lookin at commercial tools such as AccessValet, AccVerify, LIFT, etc. to see how they handle this.  </s>
<s> It is also important to have information about who is making the claim, based on what.  </s>
<s> I know of at least 3 different analyses of the relationship between 508 and WCAG, which could give different results for overall conformance based on a seres of atomic test results.  </s>
<s> You can put anything you like into the RDF for a message, no? Datatyping, use of different languages, or referring to an RDF resource which has a schema describing lots of things about the message, and is provided as one possible result of a test... Setting the earl priority scheme is probably a mistake because it seriously limits the generality of the solution.  </s>

<s> comments below  </s>
<s> i still disagree on this.  </s>
<s> why not have an assertion conducted by an assertor that speaks 0.95 and a second assertion by an assertor that speaks 1.0 within the same EARL file?  </s>
<s> agreed.  </s>
<s> having 'temporal stability' is also useful to compare different test runs conducted on the same subject that might have changed over time...  </s>
<s> will dig more around here.  </s>
<s> only i want to try to get away from analyzing the "who is making the claim" part and concentrate on the "based on what" part.  </s>
<s> does this make any sense at all?  </s>
<s> hmmm. ok, maybe "priority" is a bad concept but leaving the message definitions totally in the hand of the assertors requires you to know who the assertor is in order to interpret these messages.  </s>
<s> what about defining a minimal message scheme for subclasses such as 'webcontent' for example?  </s>
<s> this way all assertors that conduct tests on webcontent provide a common set of messages about the results.  </s>
<s> was this the intention of the earl:message element at all?  </s>
<s> regards, shadi  </s>
<s> comments below  </s>
<s> You can do this.  </s>
<s> Indeed, because the 0.95 and 1.0 specifications have different namespaces it is simplicity itself to mix them without trying to make sure that the version property is being applied to the right bits of information (which can get messy over a merge).  </s>
<s> Yep, I agree.  </s>
<s> It is as I understand it.  </s>
<s> Defining some obvious message types would be helpful, but I am not sure that they belong in the message namespace - more likely they should be defined along with a set of tests (e.g. WCAG defines some checkpoints, we make an RDF version that also defines some basic properties of failure that live in that namespace).  </s>
<s> You can't get away from the problem of needing to know who the assertor is without using ontology mapping, which on a webscale is probably only feasible using OWL (or its predecessors DAML, OIL, or the imaginatively named DAML+OIL).  </s>
<s> Providing a couple of sample ontologies would be helpful - Ian Hickson talked about one in Bristol which included such properties as catastrophic failure, failure consequential on another failure, failure due to minor bug, etc.  </s>
<s> It is also possible to envisage many of these things as being subClasses of earl:Fail - this can be done just using the RDF Vocabulary (formerly called RDF Schema) definitions, which would also allow attaching a human-readable explanation of the failure type.  </s>
<s> I think earl:message is most likely to be helpful for the cases where there is no obvious re-usability - just a catch-all place to put extra info.  </s>
<s> Best use of the fact that EARL is RDF is to find smarter ways of doing things... IMHO a text string is always a last resort unless it is an rdfs:label or an explicitly labelled description :) cheers Chaals  </s>
