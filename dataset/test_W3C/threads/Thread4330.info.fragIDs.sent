<s> The SOAP WG has decided to adopt the XQuery Data Model for its Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).  </s>
<s> MTOM describes an optimization mechanism for message transmission and "on-the-wire" format for SOAP message which may refer to non-XML message parts.  </s>
<s> As part of the MTOM design, members of the SOAP WG have used the XQuery Data Model specification [1] and wished to make comments on the wording of the document.  </s>
<s> In particular, the SOAP WG has found it necessary to clarify our use of the  </s>
<s> wording relating to Accessors in section 5 of [1] due to perceived ambiguities when used wrt the xbinc:include element for MTOM: Section 5.3 dm:node-name: It was not obvious from the Data Model specification what the syntax for this accessor should be.  </s>
<s> We eventually decided it should be, xs:Qname("http://www.w3.org/...../xbinc", "include") but this was only by noticing the example in Appendix D of the specification.  </s>
<s> We should probably have read the sections on Functions and Operators, but this was not obvious.  </s>
<s> Section 5.4 dm:parent, the specification sates "Returns the value of the parent property" which is not a particularly useful description of the accessor.  </s>
<s> It is not  </s>
<s> clear from traversing the internal hyperlinks how one determines the parent of a  </s>
<s> given node.  </s>
<s> Section 5.5 dm:string-value is fairly well specified for each node type (sections 6.2.2, 6.3.2) Section 5.6 dm:typed-value is also fairly well specified.  </s>
<s> Section 5.7 dm:type, the description "Returns the vaue of the type property" is not very useful.  </s>
<s> Section 5.8 dm:children, once again, the description is not very useful.  </s>
<s> The same problem exists for many of the accessor descriptions in Section 6.  </s>
<s> Many of the descriptions are of the form: db:XXXX "returns the value of the XXXX property"  </s>
<s> A subsection of 6 (i.e., 6.1, 6.2, ...) should be read entirely to understand the behaviour of an accessor.  </s>
<s> For example, for Element Nodes, dm:children is defined as "returns the value of the children property" in 6.2.2. 6.2.1 defines some constraints over the children property, but does not define it.  </s>
<s> 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 specify own this property is constructed from an Infoset or a PSVI.  </s>
<s> Adding some links between those parts would be helpful to a reader.  </s>
<s> In the  </s>
<s> case of dm:children for Element Nodes, it would help to add a reference in the definition of dm:children for Element Nodes in 6.2.2 to the definition of children property in 6.2.1; and also to  </s>
