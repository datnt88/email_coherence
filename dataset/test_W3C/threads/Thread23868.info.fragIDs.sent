<s> In FAQ I read next: Requesting Password-protected Web/FTP sites User authentication support for password-protected sites is also available by www4mail.  </s>
<s> To access such Web site/pages conforming to the pattern `protocol://username:password@site/directory' you need to know (and then pass on) the correct USERNAME and PASSWORD.  </s>
<s> In these cases send an e-mail Subject: (... whatever you like) and write in the body of the e-mail: or ftp://username:password@site/path where site/path is the machine,domain,directory,file you want to retrieve and the @-sign is used to separate the string `username:password' from the site/path.  </s>
<s> I use next line mypassword@ccnow.com/login/"  </s>
<s> http://mylogin:mypassword@ccnow.com/login/ and mypassword@www.amexmail.com/"  </s>
<s> http://mylogin:mypassword@www.amexmail.com/  </s>
