<s> I believe the main benefit of early support for the DeltaV protocol is that you can provide WebDAV access (and therefore all of the current WebDAV clients such as Word 2000 and the Windows Explorer can run against your server), and that a simple "DeltaV helper" client can let you do explicit checkout/checkin if it is needed.  </s>
<s> As more clients support the DeltaV operations, the DeltaV helper client can eventually be phased out.  </s>

<s> There is also the Subversion client -- Subversion uses the DeltaV protocol, and provides both client and server pieces.  </s>
