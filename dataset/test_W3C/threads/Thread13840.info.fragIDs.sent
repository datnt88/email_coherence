<s> Brian suggested that links to non-HTML resources should go via an intermediate HTML page.  </s>
<s> Actually, I think that the way that W3C specs point to a collection of versions - HTML, zip, tgz, etc, and say what each one is, is sufficient, and that we do not need to require further work.  </s>
<s> But perhaps there should be a guideline about this: Guideline: Where a link points to a resource in a 'format which is not a w3c  </s>
<s> recommendation (eg pdf, zip, powerpoint etc - what is the position of plain text here?)' then it should be made clear in the text (preferably) of, or (else) near the link what kind of a resource is being pointed to.  </s>
<s> [p2/3?]  </s>
<s> example: This document is available in several formats: A href="mydoc.htm" HTML version /A , A HREF="mydoc.rtf" Rich Text Format (Priamrily for Microsoft Word processors) /A , A HREF="mydoc.pdf" PDF- Portable Document or Acrobat format, which requires /A the A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/" the acrobat reader, which can be downloaded free for many platforms /A .  </s>
<s> Rationale: Browsers must be individually configured to recognise various file formats.  </s>
<s> Although all browsers recognise HTML and plain text, other formats may or may not be recognised automatically.  </s>
<s> In adddition, users may not have the required software, or may not be able to run it, and it is therefore a waste of their time to download a document in that format.  </s>
<s> Thoughts people?  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> Hmmm. Fine idea, but I suspect that in practice it won't happen.  </s>
<s> Most browsers use the .xyz  </s>
<s> extensions to determine type automagically anyway.  </s>
<s> I don't know whether this is an officially standard practise, or just a sensible one.  </s>
<s> But then I do know that it doesn't always work properly (when I first installed explorer 4 it decided that Netscape, as the default browser at the time, should handle .html  </s>
<s> files.  </s>
<s> Would setting TYPE have fixed this?), so having explicit TYPE is useful.  </s>
<s> Charles  </s>
<s> The TYPE attribute should also be used for non-HTML links too.  </s>
<s> Expanded example: This document is available in several formats: A href="mydoc.htm" HTML version /A , A HREF="mydoc.rtf" TYPE="application/rtf" Rich Text Format (Priamrily for Microsoft Word processors) /A , A HREF="mydoc.pdf" TYPE="application/pdf" PDF-Portable Document or Acrobat format, which requires /A the A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/" the acrobat reader, which can be downloaded free for many platforms /A .  </s>
<s> This allows a clever user agent (of which none currently exist, mind you) to flag selected links that are not supported or perhaps are set to be flagged by user preferences.  </s>
<s> Sample rendering: This document is available in several formats: _HTML version_, _Rich Text Format_ [Unsupported], _PDF-Portable Document or Acrobat format which requires_ [External viewer] the _the acrobat reader, which can be downloaded free for many platforms_.  </s>

<s> Actually most of them use the content-type set by the server.  </s>
<s> Some of them fall back on displaying text/plain or text/html based on the extension, or perhaps simply guessing or checking the system registry for that extension if they can't figure it out.  </s>
<s> So there would be advantage in setting TYPE attributes, in that the file wouldn't need to be downloaded from the server (to get the content-type HTTP header) in order to determine that it can't be displayed by the browser.  </s>

<s> TO:kynn-hwg@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> Thus the advantage of setting the type attribute is mainly in automatically retrieved objects (e.g., OBJECT) to save the browser time and effort to decide whether it can display the object or not.  </s>
<s> In this regard I wonder why the IMG element has no type attribute.  </s>
<s> In regular links (anchors) it maybe useful mainly as a fall back to encounter the possibility that the server is misconfigured and sending wrong MIME types.  </s>
<s> However authors should not count on the type attribute as most browsers do not recognize it.  </s>
<s> It may also save some time to the user as the browser may alert the user of the type when "clicking" before the document is retrieved.  </s>
<s> However authors should warn the users of the type in the text of the document to avoid surprises.  </s>

<s> Yes I agree with Kynn that where possible hints which can be processed automatically should be given.  </s>

<s> I don't recall why IMG did not get a "type" attribute in HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> It might have been an oversight or it might have been that the OBJECT element was given "type" in the hope that it would largely replace IMG. - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
