<s> In this message: it seemed that there was confusion over the correct way to indicate the type of an annotation.  </s>
<s> Jim Ley thought that annotations should have an rdf:type of a:Annotation and could optionally have an a:annotationType which described the annotation type in more detail.  </s>
<s> But the protocol page indicates that there can be two different rdf:type's.  </s>
<s> Can anyone clarify this?  </s>

<s> I think there is confusion.  </s>
<s> In the experimental EARL server we set up at W3C the annotations do not have a type of a:Annotation (where a is the common annotea namespace) at all - they are merely EARL data.  </s>
<s> I suspect that it would have been more useful to make these annotations perhaps with a type that was different to the existing list (something like the Dublin Core relation element?).  </s>
<s> We can experiment further... Cheers Charles  </s>

<s> Currently all annotations are of type rdf:type a:Annotation (namespace a=http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#).  </s>
<s> They typically also have a more specific annotation subclass type e.g. rdf:type aT:Comment (namespace aT =http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#).  </s>
<s> It is also possible for a group to define other annotation subtypes and use them.  </s>
<s> The a:Annotation could naturally be left out and just infer it from the more specific type by using the knowledge about subClassOf definition between the types.  </s>
<s> We have not currently done it for couple of reasons related to history and optimization.  </s>
