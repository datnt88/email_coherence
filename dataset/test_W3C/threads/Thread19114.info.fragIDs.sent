<s> I want to display a message to explain to my readers why their browser doesn't display MathML correctly, but to hide the message if they are using a MathML enabled browser.  </s>
<s> I have achieved partial success: This document is formatted using MathML--see http://www.w3.org/Math/.  </s>
<s> It won't look very good unless you view it with a MathML enabled browser.  </s>
<s> One such browser is Amaya--see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/.  </s>
<s> There is also a MathML-enabled version of Mozilla for Linux--see http://www.mozilla.org/releases/.  </s>
<s> Is there a better way?  </s>
<s> I'd like to put hypertext links in the message, but haven't figured out how.  </s>
<s> The "mphantom" element leaves some ugly horizontal space.  </s>
<s> I've tried to remove it with an "mpadded" element, but to no avail.  </s>
<s> Is it too late to hope for a mnomath element in MathML?  </s>
<s> I guess it's a good idea.  </s>
<s> We'll try to fix that in the next release.  </s>
