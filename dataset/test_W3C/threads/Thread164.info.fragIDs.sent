<s> DAVE, I DOWNLOADED TIDY (GUI VERSION) AND RAN A WEB PAGE I HAD CREATED.  </s>

<s> No, you created the error and Tidy reported it!  </s>

<s> Or, even more accurately: bin/query?q=%22islet+transplant%22&amp;amp;kl=XX&amp;amp;pg=q&amp;amp;Translate=on  </s>
<s> This contains all instances of "&amp;" escaped to "&amp;amp;", instead of just one.  </s>

<s> The HTML specs require &amp; to be escaped, e.g. as &amp;amp; and browsers already know how to deal with this.  </s>
<s> Tidy is doing the right thing to make the document into valid HTML, however, Tidy does include a means to prevent &amp; from being escaped if you insist on this.  </s>
<s> Take a look at the quote-ampersand option.  </s>
