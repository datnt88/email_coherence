<s> It might be a bit too informal, but a possible starting point The web accessibility guidelines exists because: Not all output devices are the same A screen reader will not read pictorial content, neither will an internet cell-phone.  </s>
<s> Not all input devices are the same Keypads, keyboards, mouse, viva la difference Not all systems are the same And I'm not just talking about Netscape and Microsoft Not all people are the same Some folks are learning disables, some are visually challenged, You probably have a few friends who are color impaired, some are sensitive to flashing screens; But all this does not have to be a problem Because we are working to make the web, all the information, and all the fun, accessible to all.  </s>

<s> I can't recall how long it is since I sent an update.  </s>
<s> I gave a presentation on accessibility at Monash University, and another (essentially the same) at RMIT university - in each case to audiences who were primarily staff involved in web development or teaching it.  </s>
<s> I attended a meeting of a Melbourne accessibility group, with a presentation of the Deaf Australia Online projects - interesting.  </s>
<s> Essentially they are asking for significant multimedia content, including signed "captions", where possible (or where you want the audience to be interested...) I attended the W3C/WAP multimodal workshop in Hong Kong.  </s>
<s> Among other things they are looking for use cases for multimodal devices (for example phones that can handle graphics, text, or speech in/out).  </s>
