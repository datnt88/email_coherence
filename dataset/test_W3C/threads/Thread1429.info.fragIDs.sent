<s> Hi, After reading through sections 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 (with a group of other MERANT staff) here is a list of issues/questions (some of these issues are editorial and simply need clarification in the spec, others are real issues/questions).  </s>
<s> [Editorial] In the specification some of the sections eg, 10.1,10.2 have no white space after the section number, others (eg section 9.7,1.6  </s>
<s> do have a single space).  </s>
<s> Some sections, eg 13.10 are followed by multiple whitespace characters.  </s>
<s> I think this is caused by conversion from Microsoft Word to ASCII.  </s>
<s> We should correct this before submitting the draft.  </s>
<s> [Editorial]  </s>
<s> Section 3.1.4, the last sentence does not seem to make sense, it reads: "A live property is supported by a resource if that property has the semantics defined for that property" The property always has the semantics defined for that property.  </s>
<s> Now we  </s>
<s> have the property-o-rama we could replace that definition with something like: "A live property is supported by a resource as specified in Appendix A (section 23)."  </s>
<s> [Issue/Editorial] Section 3.9 the specification says that when a resource is automatically checked out: "the DAV:checked-in property MUST be empty"  </s>
<s> Should it be empty or should it be removed, I read this statement as meaning that DAV:supported-live-property-set would still contain DAV:checked-in and that a PROPFIND on DAV:checked-in would return an empty value.  </s>
<s> I thought we were going to remove the DAV:checked-in property from the supported-property list when the resource is checked-out.  </s>
<s> The specification should be consistent with respect to which properties are removed and which are empty in the various states of the resource since it is crucial for the whole "check the properties to find out what type of resource this is" system to work.  </s>
<s> This also applies to section 4.4 where it talks about properties being "no longer set".  </s>
<s> [Editorial] Section 4.4 starts to talk about the UNCHECKOUT on a Working Resource.  </s>
<s> I think this text would make more sense if it was in "Working Resource Feature" section 8.  </s>
<s> [Issue] Section 4.3 states for CHECKIN that : "The response for a successful request MUST include a Location header".  </s>
<s> The only time deltav talks about the location header is for CHECKIN of a VCR and CHECKOUT of a working resource (section 9.3).  </s>
<s> Why is this only on those methods?  </s>
<s> What is the use case for it  </s>
<s> (does it simply save the client from having to PROPFIND the DAV:checked-in?).  </s>
<s> I ask this because  </s>
<s> the Location header is not returned by other methods that create resources, eg UNLOCK etc for  </s>
<s> auto-versioning clients (eg when automatically checking in).  </s>
<s> I suggest we either remove the feature or use it consistently eg whenever a new resource is created return the Location header.  </s>
<s> [Issue]  </s>
<s> Section 5.4.1 since this report is on a collection I would like a Depth header defined.  </s>
<s> Again I think we should be consistent (to avoid speical-case coding).  </s>
<s> Any method that gets properties of a collection should take a Depth header.  </s>
<s> [Issue] Section 5.5 defines this mechanism where OPTIONS can be used to find a possible location in the namespace that is to be used for version histories.  </s>
<s> I assume this is so a client can indicate in a GUI if a collection is a collection of version histories or a client could choose not to display that part of the namespace.  </s>
<s> It seems odd that this is only available for version histories, these are not the only resource that have "server-defined" URLs.  </s>
<s> For example would the clients want a OPTIONS request to indicate where in the namespace will be used to reference versions as opposed to version controlled resources?  </s>
<s> The same arguments as in section 5.5 applies to versions, they may not be stored on the same server etc.  </s>
<s> I also think an example of the OPTIONS method being used for this would be good as it is quite different from other uses of OPTIONS.  </s>
<s> [Editorial/Issue]  </s>
<s> Reading section 5.6 it took us quite a while to decide how to delete the last version from a version history.  </s>
<s> I think the answer is "you don't" you must delete the version history  </s>
<s> itself in order to delete the last version.  </s>
<s> Did we interpret this correctly?  </s>
<s> Do you think we should clarify this in  </s>
<s> the spec?  </s>
<s> I look forward to seeing some of you at the deltav sessions in London tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Regards, Peter Raymond - MERANT  </s>
<s> Hi Peter, I'm going to skip most of the editorial points you make and comment on some of the issues you raised:  </s>
<s> This is a (somewhat desperate) attempt to define the supported properties.  </s>
<s> The point is that if the property is 'live' i.e., its semantics are enforced by the server, and those semantics are those defined by this document, then it is a 'supported' property in the DeltaV sense.  </s>
<s> Alternative wording is invited.  </s>
<s> I think we have agreed that the properties should be removed (not just made empty).  </s>
<s> The Location: header is required in the response to a successful check-in of a version-controlled resource to indicate which version was created by the CHECKIN.  </s>
<s> Without the Location: header there would be a race condition between the client checking in the resource and PROPFINDing the DAV:checked-in property with other clients that may be checking-out the version-controlled resource or UPDATEing it, that would loose that information.  </s>
<s> The Location: header is required in the response to a successful CHECKOUT of a version to indicate to the client the server defined working resource URL.  </s>
<s> I ask this because the Location header is not returned by other methods that create resources, eg UNLOCK etc  </s>
<s> (UNLOCK will not create a resource) In general, the methods that create resources do so at user-defined URLs (e.g., PUT, MKCOL, MOVE, etc.  </s>
<s> Auto-versioning clients, by definition would not know about any extensions we would define for them.  </s>
<s> All REPORTs may take a Depth: header (see versioning-16 Sec.  </s>
<s> 3.6)  </s>
<s> That was not the motivation for providing this information.  </s>
<s> In general, the version histories will be maintained in server-defined URL space which is likely to not conflict with user URLs.  </s>
<s> The mechanism was provided to give clients the ability to locate version histories 'from scratch'.  </s>
<s> This is required when clients remove all the version-controlled resources that refer to (versions in a particular) version history.  </s>
<s> Since without any version-controlled resources all that remains is the version histories and versions, which are all at server-defined URLs, they can become 'orphaned'.  </s>
<s> This mechanism gives clients a way to find them again.  </s>
<s> There was no attempt to refine the description of the server storage to this level of detail.  </s>
<s> That's not to say a particular server cannot include such information, only that it is not required for versioning clients and servers to interoperate.  </s>
<s> ACK.  </s>
<s> Yes, that is correct.  </s>
<s> Just one of the riddles for the careful reader g .  </s>
<s> Do you think we should clarify this in the spec?  </s>
<s> Yes. Regards, Tim  </s>

<s> We should correct this before submitting the draft.  </s>
<s> Yes, I will be doing this (I used to do this for the internet drafts, but after around draft 6, decided it was not a productive use of my time :-).  </s>
<s> Section 4.4 starts to talk about the UNCHECKOUT on a Working Resource.  </s>
<s> I think this text would make more sense if it was in "Working Resource Feature" section 8. Done.  </s>

<s> All REPORTs may take a Depth: header (see versioning-16 Sec.  </s>
<s> 3.6) Yes, but I think Peter's point was that the Depth header is missing in the example.  </s>
<s> It is in fact missing ... I've added it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for noticing!  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> As currently implemented, my server will allow you to delete the last version.  </s>
<s> That version goes away and the VCR reverts to the next to last version.  </s>
<s> That solution works because I don't fork.  </s>
<s> But if the consensus is to prohibit this I can prohibit it (except as a side effect of UNCHECKOUT, though).  </s>
<s> Ah, the wonderful ambiguities of English ... (:-).  </s>
<s> This thread was about deleting the "last" version in the sense of "the only version left in the version history".  </s>
<s> The result of this would be a version history with no versions in it, which is not allowed by the spec.  </s>
<s> I believe you are referring to the "last" version in the sense of "the one that was created most recently in a linear history".  </s>
<s> That is totally legal to delete (assuming it is not the only version left in the history), and having the VCR revert to the immediately preceding version is very reasonable (although not required by the protocol).  </s>

<s> Good.  </s>
<s> I already forbid deleting the only version, though I didn't know the spec actually said I had too.  </s>
<s> That didn't prevent me from having someone try to delete the only version and log a bug because they couldn't.  </s>
<s> :)  </s>
