<s> Obviously something that was wrong has been put right now.  </s>
<s> For all of these, we would like to have included: - Whether or not it can be used as a MIME text/* character set (basically, whether CRLF is a 2-byte sequence encoded as 0x0D0A) (this is a requirement on the registration) - If possible, pointers to a stable specification of the character sets, if possible with enough information to permit mapping tables to/from ISO 10646 to be constructed.  </s>

<s> Yes. A simple search gave me URL:http://www.as400.ibm.com/euro/roadmap.htm , which looks like quite relevant, though.  </s>
<s> However, as Harald noted, these informations are a little too evasive (for example, I am unable to understand easily what 924 looks like, based on the informations I read; I should add that I already know all the others, so I am biased to determine if the description is sufficient or not).  </s>
