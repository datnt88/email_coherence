<s> This does not look disastrous to me.  </s>
<s> In RDF URIrefs ending in # (i.e. with explicitly empty fragment) only regularly occur as namespace names.  </s>
<s> All possible uses of such URIrefs involve qnames which give them a non-emtpy fragment part.  </s>
<s> The text in question  </s>
<s> "URI producers and normalizers should omit a delimiter if the component it  </s>
<s> delimits is empty" uses a "should" not a "MUST", and is hence sufficiently weak.  </s>
<s> We perhaps could suggest modifying the text: , with one exception: a double-slash delimiter indicating an authority component should not be removed, even when the authority is empty, since doing so can lead to misinterpreting the path.  </s>
<s> to .  </s>
<s> A first exception is: a double-slash delimiter indicating an authority component should not be removed, even when the authority is empty, since doing so can lead to misinterpreting the path.  </s>
<s> A second exception is: a common idiom in RDF/XML uses URI references with empty fragments as XML namespace names.  </s>
<s> The overall normalization rules in section 6 inevitable create a many positive matches that are not honoured in RDF  </s>

<s> Like XML namespaces we chose the simplest possible definition of  </s>

<s> The overall tone of section 6 ought to respect such a choice.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Yes, but the text also seems to claim that it is always safe to apply the normalization.  </s>
<s> That is my concern.  </s>
<s> Section 6.1 says "... while strictly avoiding false positives".  </s>
<s> I think it would also apply to empty path and query components, so I'm not happy to just pick out empty fragments as a second exception.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>

<s> Jeremy,  </s>
<s> It appears we are in agreement about RDF (phew!  </s>
<s> ;-)...  </s>
<s> Again, I don't think we are silent.  </s>
<s> In RDF, they are different URIs by my understanding.  </s>
<s> And what about: compared with: ftp://foobar/ and ftp://foobar:80/ RDF knows nothing about schemes, so they must be different, surely?  </s>
<s> My understanding is that RDF Semantics does not say that these are the same, however, it does not prohibit adding (with an understanding of owl:sameAs).  </s>
<s> Exactly.  </s>
<s> My concern is that the revised RFC2396bis suggests that it is *always* safe to replace one with the other, by the language: Even though it is possible to determine that two URIs are equivalent, it is never possible to be sure that two URIs identify different resources.  </s>
<s> For example, an owner of two different domain names could decide to serve the same resource from both, resulting in two different URIs.  </s>
<s> Therefore,  </s>
<s> comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives while strictly avoiding false positives.  </s>
<s> -- http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#equivalence  </s>
<s> Specifically: "while strictly avoiding false positives"  </s>
<s> A SemWeb reading of the section of RFC2396bis that we are reviewing could be that a web service could automatically generate such a triple for every http URI it sees.  </s>
<s> I would see such a web service as compliant with both RFC 2396 bis, and with RDF Semantics.  </s>
<s> (It is adding new information, but information which one of the authorities involved (IETF) underwrites).  </s>
<s> I figure I must be misunderstanding what you are saying.  </s>
<s> Maybe my responses will flush out the disconnect.  </s>
<s> I have tried to turn into it a test triple: is not implied by RDF Semantics combined with OWL Semantics but is implied by RDF Semantics + OWL Semantics + comparison ladder from RFC 2396bis.  </s>
<s> Yes. But I have two concerns: (a) a future version of RDF would presumably cite RFC2396bis, in which case it acquires an additional axiom, which I think is a potential source of surprise.  </s>
<s> (b) the RDF rules for formation of URIrefs from namespaces and local names mean that URIrefs may be changed (by the RFC2396bis normalization) in ways that cannot be described by additional assertions of this kind.  </s>
<s> Conversely NOT is not implied by any recommendation.  </s>
<s> Hence, most RDF systems should not endorse the test triple, but must not contradict it.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> RDF systems may explicitly implement the comparison ladder and then would endorse the test triple.  </s>
<s> Then some given RDF may have different meanings when processed by different systems.  </s>
<s> If the triple is to be endorsed, I think it should be explicit (somewhere) in the RDF data.  </s>
<s> In the open world, the test triple is true;  </s>
<s> That seems like an unjustified leap to me.  </s>
<s> It may be true in the "open world" *when used for the purposes of retrieval*, but there are other purposes (e.g. URIref formation from namespace URI) for which it is not true.  </s>
<s> In practice, we would hope that people do not assign different meanings to URIs that differ in these ways, but we seem to agree that this is not prohibited by RDF.  </s>
<s> ... but it is not part of the open world that we expect RDF systems to be aware of.  </s>
<s> #g  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> But the primary issue here is, if they ARE used then they should NOT be considered to be identical or interchangeable.  </s>
<s> Substituting one form of a URI for another could produce unforseeable and potentially catastrophic consequences for any SW reasoner.  </s>
<s> I agree with Graham that this is a potentially serious problem that we should nip in the bud.  </s>
<s> I also would like to be a co-signatory on the proposed textual changes; Graham, please include me.  </s>
<s> I particularly like the inclusion of the phrase " for purposes of retrieval" as it acknowledges that URIs have other purposes.  </s>

<s> OK, here's what I propose: Further to my earlier message [1], I've discussed the issue of URI normalization with some colleagues and we'd like to propose the following small change of wording with respect to [2] (announcement [3]): Section 6.1, para 2, final sentence: The suggested change is to this sentence: Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives while strictly avoiding false positives.  </s>
<s> To be: Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives while strictly avoiding false positives when used for purposes of retrieval.  </s>
<s> Rationale: This reinforces the earlier comment that "URI comparison is performed in respect to some particular purpose" [section 6 intro], and I think provides the necessary get-out for those purposes other than retrieval for which the normalization processes described can result in false URI-equivalence (i.e. in circumstances where existing applications may legitimately deliver differing results).  </s>

<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Probably not.  </s>
<s> Better, I think, to debate the case coherently than make it a political issue.  </s>
<s> Having Jeremy and Pat supporting my comments will, I think, be enough to show it's not an isolated comment.  </s>
<s> We're not at the stage of IETF last-call yet.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if people have additional comments to make that add substantially to the debate, that's always welcome.  </s>
<s> (But please bear in mind that this specification is in its final stages of being nailed down, so any comments should be addressed specifically to the specification rather than to broader issues, preferably with suggestions for improvement.)  </s>
