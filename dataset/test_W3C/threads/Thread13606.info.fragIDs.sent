<s> What can be done?  </s>
<s> I put more of the "blame" on us WAI folks for forcing or at least requesting that CAST make Bobby check every little thing that the WCAG guidelines ask for - even if it had to be a manual check.  </s>
<s> Sometimes we err on academic purity rather than practical usefulness.  </s>
<s> But the good news is that the next release of Bobby will allow one to select which checks to conduct.  </s>
<s> For example, you could ask Bobby to only check the machine checkable priority one items.  </s>
<s> You will even be able to select which priority one items to check.  </s>
<s> Of course CAST have been working to improve the algorithms of the checking that it does.  </s>
<s> So most of the problems that Charles noted should be fixed as well as others he didn't note.  </s>
<s> What else can be done you ask? - review and comment on the Evaluation and Repair Techniques document - upon which Bobby will be basing it's checking algorithms.  </s>

<s> Phil and others, Thanks for responding to Chuck O. and Bruce with such constructive comments.  </s>
<s> I do appreciate it.  </s>
<s> Michael is in Amsterdam at the WWW Conference and I do want him to provide the official response to Chuck Oppermann who, as usual, raises a number of very legitimate issues.  </s>
<s> We have been concerned about the number of manual checks displayed for a very long time and have wrestled with an approach that keeps them in open yet causes developers not to be overwhelmed by the list and all of the code.  </s>
<s> This can be especially problematic when using Bobby to make a presentation to others hoping to convince them that, with just a little effort, they too can create accessible sites.  </s>
<s> I have been in Bobby funding presentations where I dared not run Bobby on that organization's Website lest the Webmaster be fired for what might appear to be total incompetence.  </s>
<s> Anyways, having lost Keith Kostorf as our Bobby Java programmer slowed down the release of Bobby 3.2 just a bit and we hope to have some news shortly.  </s>
<s> This is not an official announcement as Michael will be responsible for that.  </s>

<s> Hi all - sorry to make such a delayed response to this thread, I just got the messages today, my email access has been sporadic during my time in Amsterdam.  </s>
<s> I'll start by seconding what Phill Jenkins and Chuck Hitchcock have already said - we do attempt to provide completeness of coverage of the guidelines; currently this is at an expense of usability, which we fully acknowledge and are working on solutions.  </s>
<s> Coming up with these solutions requires significant design time, and we benefit greatly from feedback in forums such as this and our email at bobby@cast.org.  </s>
<s> Implementing solutions is also a large task for us in the current architecture, which is several years old, so the solutions have not come as quickly as many, including us, would like.  </s>
<s> We have a plan in place to rewrite Bobby from the ground up, with the specific intent of creating an architecutre that will enable us to address issues like this more quickly; we also want to enlarge the team to improve our response time.  </s>
<s> We have not yet ascertained how to fund this enlargement of the project as new sponsors have been slow to appear, but we are working on this and I am hopeful that we will in fact be able to move forward on that work soon.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, we have focused our efforts on developing a version 3.2 that, more or less, addresses the largest issues that have been brought to us.  </s>
<s> Many unexpected development cycle issues have delayed this release, including most recently the loss of our previous programmer, but we do think we are close to that release.  </s>
<s> As Phill mentioned, one of the projects has been to add the ability to filter guidelines out of the report that you don't want.  </s>
<s> The filter can be on the basis of a particular priority level, or on the "automaticity" of the guidelines so you aren't presented with issues that may or may not be relevant to a particular page, etc.  </s>
<s> The "Bobby Approved" rating will continue to require compliance with all Priority 1 checkpoints, so users who use this filter option will need to account for that if they seek to claim Bobby Approved status.  </s>
<s> For many people, though, that is not the goal and the suppression of unwanted checkpoints will increase the relevance of the report.  </s>
<s> The other major goal for this release has been to improve the accuracy of our evaluation as much as possible within the current architecture.  </s>
<s> Again, Phill mentioned the guidelines from the WAI Evaluation and Repair group, to which we have actively contributed and from which we have drawn extensively in the 3.2 implementation.  </s>
<s> We have moved many items from "partial detection" to "complete detection" status, and many more from "no detection" to "partial detection" status, so this version will also be inherently more useful even without the report filtering option.  </s>
<s> Here I should describe the distinction between the above detection types, which I think is at the core of the confusion I see here.  </s>
<s> Again, I acknowledge that the wording of the report does not explain this well, and we are trying to find a terse wording [a non-terse wording would introduce another usabilty problem] that will do so.  </s>
<s> Broadly, "complete detection" items can be detected definitively by Bobby.  </s>
<s> "Partial detection" items are more confusing - it means a trigger exists which tells Bobby it needs to ask a question, but it cannot answer the question fully on its own.  </s>
<s> For example, if a TABLE is found, there are guidelines that apply only if the table is used for layout, and others only if it is used for data, but Bobby does not have a heuristic to determine which role the table plays, so it has to ask, as in "If this table contains data in rows and columns ...".  </s>
<s> For another example, we have not yet written a module to allow Bobby to evaluate script languages, so whenever it detects a SCRIPT element it has to ask a series of questions related to scripts.  </s>
<s> The third category, "no detection", is straightforward though not clearly differentiated from the others in the report; basically there are no particular triggers we could give Bobby, such as the checkpoint to use navigation bars - there is no NAVBAR element, so any group of images and/or links may or may not be a navigation bar.  </s>
<s> Bobby just asks those questions in every report.  </s>
<s> I could go over each of the Bobby report items that confused you and fit them into the explanations above, but that's probably not a good use of this forum.  </s>
<s> Let me just speak to a couple that are especially relevant.  </s>
<s> The one about properly positioning form labels - that is triggered actually be the presence of form controls, not LABEL elements.  </s>
<s> This is because it's a backwards-compatibility checkpoint; people whose browsers, screen readers, Braille displays, etc. don't support the LABEL element have no way of knowing which piece of text functions as the label for a form control except by positional context.  </s>
<s> So proper use of the LABEL element does not, currently, remove the need to also consider label positioning.  </s>
<s> Another example, the advisory to use Q and BLOCKQUOTE elements - this is one of the ones asked on every page - Bobby can't detect the presence of quotes on the page that may need this markup, so it's just asked.  </s>
<s> Finally, the browser compatibility error - I tend to see those as advisories - they indicate elements, attributes, and values that are not supported by a particular browser.  </s>
<s> However, browsers support different sets (thus the need for browser compatibility tests), and since the usual behavior is to ignore unknown elements and attributes, if you know something functions properly in one target browser it's probably ok for the rest.  </s>
<s> Note too that as far as Bobby is concerned HTML 4.0 is a "browser" even though it's really a specification.  </s>
<s> We've been working on the explanations of these items (that you get by selecting the hyperlinked error title in the report) and hope they will also be much clearer in Bobby 3.2.  </s>
<s> The best ways you can help us to reduce confusions caused by Bobby's implementation of the Guidelines is to send us feedback to bobby@cast.org and, if you represent an organization that is a potential funder, contact our development officer, Don Giller, dgiller@cast.org.  </s>
<s> I assure you that we are committed to providing the best support for the guidelines possible for us, and to keeping Bobby available for free at the same time.  </s>

<s> "Priority 3, item 4: Specify a logical tab order among form controls, links and objects.  </s>
<s> (2 instances)" I did exactly that with TABINDEX in the LABEL tag.  </s>
<s> Bobby should be smart enough to know that the SELECT control was nested inside the LABEL block and since the LABEL had a TABINDEX attribute should not report the error.  </s>
