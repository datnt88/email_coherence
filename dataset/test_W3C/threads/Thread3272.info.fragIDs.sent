<s> To try to push forward, because many people seem to use it without having a clear definition of what it is.  </s>

<s> That this otherwise brilliant company wastes untold bandwidth to deliver a look and feel no one admires says everything you need to know about the entrenched mindset of developers who hold "backward compatibility" in higher esteem than reason, usability, or their own profits.  </s>
<s> What do developers mean by "backward compatibility?"  </s>
<s> They mean using non-standard, proprietary (or deprecated) markup and code to ensure that every visitor has the same experience, whether they're sporting Netscape Navigator 1.0 or IE6.  </s>
<s> Held up as a Holy Grail of professional development practice, "backward compatibility" sounds good in theory.  </s>
<s> But the cost is too high and the practice has always been based on a lie.  </s>
<s> There is no true backward compatibility.  </s>
<s> There is always a cut-off point.  </s>
<s> For instance, neither Mosaic (the first visual browser) nor Netscape 1.0 support HTML table-based layouts.  </s>
<s> By definition, then, those who use these ancient browsers cannot possibly have the same  </s>
<s> visual experience as folks who view the Web through later browsers like Netscape 1.1 or MSIE2.  </s>
<s> Developers and clients who strive for backward compatibility inevitably choose a "baseline browser" (say, Netscape 3) beyond which they will make no effort.  </s>
<s> To support that baseline browser and those that succeeded it, developers layer their markup with a series of  </s>
<s> browser-specific, non-standard hacks and workarounds that add weight to every page.  </s>
<s> At the same time, they write multiple scripts to accommodate the browsers they've chosen to support, and use browser detection to feed each browser the code it likes best.  </s>
<s> In so doing, these developers further increase the girth of their pages, pump up the load on their servers, and ensure that the race against perpetual obsolescence will continue until they run out of money or go out of business.  </s>

<s> A new version of a program is said to be backward compatible if it can use files and data created with an older version of the same program.  </s>
<s> A computer is said to be backward compatible if it can run the same software as the previous model of the computer.  </s>
<s> Backward compatibility is important because it eliminates the need to start over when you upgrade to a newer product.  </s>
<s> A backward-compatible word processor, for instance, allows you to edit documents created with a previous version of the program.  </s>
<s> In general, manufacturers try to keep all their products backward compatible.  </s>
<s> Sometimes, however, it is necessary to sacrifice backward compatibility to take advantage of a new technology.  </s>
<s> The flip side of backward compatibility is upward compatibility.  </s>
<s> Upward compatible is the same as backward compatible, except that it is from the point of view of the older model.  </s>
<s> Another term for backward compatible is downward compatible Karl Dubost - http://www.w3.org/People/karl/ W3C Conformance Manager *** Be Strict To Be Cool ***  </s>
<s> The meaning of "backward compatible" in the context of the Web is pretty much the same as in any other broad context.  </s>

<s> In this case, the answer may be, there is no way to embed or include media inline, other than object , because embed was never included in a markup version.  </s>
