<s> I just tried this tool for the first time.  </s>
<s> On first reading, I had expected it to perform automated online tests, in the manner of Site Valet or Bobby.  </s>
<s> When I found the response to be very slow, I naturally thought it was fetching and analysing my page.  </s>
<s> But I find it's a purely manual process.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that if this tool becomes popular, it could easily be abused (intentionally or otherwise) to "cry wolf" with bogus reports.  </s>
<s> Indeed, I could even use it as a spam machine, by pointing a 'bot at it and causing it to crawl the web and mail messages 'from' Site Valet or any other such service to webmasters.  </s>
<s> Most of the tests implied in rep3.cgi  </s>
<s> *can be* easily automated.  </s>
<s> Can I suggest that automation be built into the service where possible, to help users prepare reports and - more importantly - avoid generating bogus reports that could devalue the service / bring it into disrepute.  </s>
<s> I've got the software, so I can put my money where my mouth is here.  </s>
<s> If anyone would like a more detailed proposal, let me know.  </s>

<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> A few weeks ago I went through the motions of expressing an interest in joining the WG, and had a very brief reply from Daniel Dardailler welcoming me.  </s>
<s> Since then I've discovered a problem I didn't quite anticipate: the weekly telecons are scheduled as 90 minutes at peak- time international call rates, and I simply can't afford to do that on a regular or semi-regular basis.  </s>
<s> But I am willing and able to help with the development of WAI/ER tools, if that can be arranged, and if this group really is more receptive to offers of help than for instance the Validator (to which I have offered various things in the past; most recently a fix for a bug that has been discussed on www-validator before now, and which Liam had up-and-running in the WDG validator within about an hour of my announcing it).  </s>
<s> Some of the Site Valet software could fairly easily be re-used to automate a range of checks in the WART (and I daresay some of Bobby could be used to similar effect).  </s>
<s> So it would seem to make sense for me to take a look at it.  </s>

<s> What's the status with EARL currently?  </s>
<s> It keeps getting mentioned on the lists in two completely different contexts: 1) as a completely finished language that can already be output, and 2) as a develpment by ERT that needs a spin-off group devoted to it (the "friday group").  </s>
<s> [Note: While I would like to join the "friday group" , I certainly can't get to the meeting, and I still have no way of even getting onto a call...] As far as I can tell by reading through the archives again and looking at the ERT homepage, we have a great deal of discussion about uses etc., but not too much about syntax.  </s>
<s> The most worrying thing is that we have an architecture, but no RDF Schema yet... Daniel made a list of some of the properties needed; could some one look at the ontologies of these, and we should be able to make a Schema fairly quickly.  </s>

<s> There are a couple of candidates.  </s>
<s> I described one a year ago that has a set of properties, a schema (thanks DanConnolly), a bit of a toy in javascript that can use the properties (with its own prolog-like syntax for amking queries) that Dan Brickley made based on Jan Grant's tiny prolog interpreter.  </s>
<s> This works for basic confromance statements, but needs something else to add things like "who said", and "when" and "how do they know".  </s>
<s> I imagined that Dublin Core would be good for the first two, and AERT would provide a set of tests which have URIs that we could use for the latter.  </s>
<s> There is a desire to produce a more complete EARL - based or not on this earlier one is unclear.  </s>
<s> The meeting on Thursday morning at the W3C plenary will apparently be dedicated to just this task.  </s>
<s> That's as far as I have understood the story.  </s>

<s> Still being polished / debugged for announcement, but since the topic came up, here's a pointer: related links: (for logic/inference fans, Sean...) some more experiments I was doing (partly superceded by XJG stuff) have fun, Dan ps. yep, been lurking here a while; don't manage to read everything but will pop up if I think I can be useful...  </s>
