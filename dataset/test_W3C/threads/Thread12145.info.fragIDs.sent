<s> Checkpoint 1.2?Ensure that the tool preserves all accessibility information during authoring, transformations, and conversions.  </s>
<s> (priority 1, effectively requires two different things.  </s>
<s> One is that markup is/can be preserved, the other is that when transforming content all the information must be preserved.  </s>
<s> As an issue for ATAG 2 it might be worth seperating these out more exllicitly.  </s>
<s> Actually I think the first case is covered better in Checkpoint 4.3?Allow the author to preserve markup not recognized by the tool.  </s>
