<s> Greetings I am working on a Web front end for a database.  </s>
<s> I create a page containing a list of record titles.  </s>
<s> These titles are links to edit the corresponding record.  </s>
<s> Each link lives in the li /li of a ul .  </s>
<s> Some tools say that a separator character is still required between adjacent links.  </s>
<s> My question is: are there really any user agents out there which will try to run the contents of two li /li s together so that a separator character is  </s>
<s> really required?  </s>
<s> I would have thought that having the links as separate list  </s>
<s> items should be enough and that also the best way to handle a list of links is in a list!  </s>
<s> Cheers M Matthew Smith Kadina Business Consultancy South Australia  </s>
<s> I don't think that rule was ever intended to cover that case; it's mainly for run on within the same block element.  </s>
<s> A list of links is indeed the best way to handle a menu - yes.  </s>
<s> Structurally there would be no need for a separator I'd think, but visually ... it is easy to imagine a situation in which such a list, whilst still structurally a list, is rendered differently - say with each list item adjacent to eachother on a line.  </s>
<s> If any assistive technology now makes use of the structure there is no problem.  </s>
<s> However, if it simply enlarges the visual screen ... then it might be difficult to tell these list items apart.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest using a list for menu items, and put a "," between each.  </s>
<s> As always, it is impossible to predict how ALL UAs and ATs would behave.  </s>
