<s> In mainting compatibility with HTML 4.0 event listeners, the spec says:  </s>
<s> "In order to achieve compatibility with HTML 4.0, implementors may view the  </s>
<s> settings of attributes which represent event handlers as the creation and  </s>
<s> registration of an EventListener on the Node.  </s>
<s> The value of useCapture defaults to false.  </s>
<s> This EventListener behaves in the same manner as any  </s>
<s> other EventListeners which may be registered on the EventTarget."  </s>
<s> If the EventListener behaves in the same manner as any other EventListener,  </s>
<s> then is the attribute which represents the event handler expected to point  </s>
<s> to an object inmplementing the EventTarget interface (as opposed to a function)?  </s>
<s> ie, in HTML 4.0, I just put: BUTTON onclick="alert('foo')" with the new DOM 2 spec, would it look something like this? where 'myEventHandler' implements the event target interface?  </s>
<s> This isn't  </s>
<s> backwards compatibility, and I just want to make sure that I understand the  </s>
<s> spec correctly.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Sam Christiansen Trilogy Software  </s>
<s> My reading of this text, to use your example, is that: buttonElt.setAttribute  </s>
<s> ( "onclick", "alert('foo')" ); can be implemented as (assuming that buttonElt instanceof EventTarget == true): buttonElt.addEventListener  </s>
<s> ( "click", new Function ( "e", "alert('foo')" ), false ); However, this seems problematic to me: if an implementation is free to implement setAttribute in this manner, then would this support standard attribute semantics; i.e., what would getAttribute() return after setAttribute()?  </s>
<s> Or does this text say "in addition to setting an attribute recognized to  </s>
<s> represent an event handler, that implementors may/should/must (?) *also*  </s>
<s> create and register an equivalent EventListener on the node"?  </s>

<s> OK. So which of the "may/should/must" applies?  </s>
<s> It sounds to me like you are saying "may", in which case no content author can depend on this behavior, meaning it is rather useless to specify since the author would have to explicitly check if such behavior were implemented.  </s>
<s> If the answer is "must" then that's a different story.  </s>
