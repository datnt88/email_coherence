<s> An example of Javascript functions that are useful is form validation.  </s>
<s> This is fairly common - you fill out a form, and in a javascript-enabled browser, it checks for errors before sending the form for processing.  </s>
<s> So long as there is an equivalent for non script-enabled browsers, there isn't a problem.  </s>
<s> We tend not to use scripts much in W3C content, and theese are generally written for a specific purpose.  </s>
<s> scripts to provide things like sound interaction would be useful examples - I will look at the examples you have mentioned.  </s>

<s> if you are using client-side form validation, whether it be javascript or other methods, you need to have server-side form validation installed for those who have problems, no scripting or disabled scripting.. i see this was cross-posted and am replying to both.  </s>
