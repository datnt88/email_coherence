<s> I have finally gotten to play with the SimpleMD5 spec.  </s>
<s> from Spyglass and John Franks's toolkit.  </s>
<s> I would like to offer these suggestions.  </s>
<s> 1) The password that gets MD5-ed by the client must be stored on the server as plaintext, so the server can do MD5(nonce password).  </s>
<s> I find that to be a problem, since, at least in my environment, many of the servers are on Unix machines with shared file systems, and it would be relatively easy for someone to find another's password.  </s>
<s> I would prefer that the password be stored encoded by some function f() (possibly MD5?).  </s>
<s> Then the client would compute MD5(nonce f(passwd)), and the server could duplicate the computation, except it would have f(passwd) in its password file already.  </s>
<s> 2) I've been annoyed in Basic authentication by the fact that what the client and server call "realm" is also used as a prompt to the user.  </s>
<s> Can we separate the two concepts in SimpleMD5 (and Basic, for that matter) by having the client and server continue to exchange a "realm" attribute and have the server pass a "prompt" attribute for the client to use?  </s>
<s> A server that didn't want to do so pass the same value for "prompt" as for "realm".  </s>
<s> A client that didn't see a "prompt" attribute could use the value of "realm" as a default.  </s>
<s> 3) In the SimpleMD5 spec.  </s>
<s> (and Franks's program) there's an insistence that values (e.g., "PrideRock" in realm="PrideRock") be "-delimited.  </s>
<s> Seems to me this is only necessary when there's an embedded space or TAB or comma.  </s>
<s> How about if we tolerate a non-"-delimited span of contiguous characters that has no embedded space, TAB, or comma.  </s>
<s> (Are there other characters of which to beware too?) Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> According to Dave Kristol:  </s>
<s> This is a good idea, but it is important to understand that it doesn't really protect you the way you might think.  </s>
<s> It is still necessary to protect the password file from being read by any untrusted user.  </s>
<s> If an untrusted user gets the encoded password f(passwd) he can create MD5(nonce f(passwd)) and access everything the user with passwd is entitled to.  </s>
<s> The reason it is a good idea is that people foolishly tend to use the same password on many systems so the sysadmin on the SimpleMD5 system might read the password and guess that the user has that password on a different system.  </s>
<s> It would also be a very good idea to actually encrypt the password in the password file and decrypt it when checking access.  </s>
<s> This may involve export problems though.  </s>
<s> Here is a way one might do it using  </s>
<s> only MD5 (which is exportable).  </s>
<s> Have a KEY known only to the server and password management utilities.  </s>
<s> In the password file store username:salt:encrypted_pw where encrypted_pw :=password xor MD5( username:salt:KEY)  </s>
<s> then the server can extract password because it is equal to encrypted_pw xor MD5( username:salt:KEY) The salt must change whenever the user changes password.  </s>
<s> Someone reading the password file cannot decrypt the password without knowing KEY.  </s>
<s> I don't know how cryptographically sound this is but it should be good enough for SimpleMD5.  </s>
<s> I also am not certain that the fact that SimpleMD5 is exportable would make this exportable.  </s>
<s> John Franks  </s>
<s> I suggested having an encoded (encrypted) password in the server-side password file.  </s>
<s> John Franks said:  </s>
<s> I certainly agree, and I don't want to imply that I believe this is bullet-proof security.  </s>
<s> The point, though, is that if I grabbed a password from the server-side file, I could masquerade as a user by simply entering that user's password to my favorite browser.  </s>
<s> If the password is encoded, I have to go to some more trouble to spoof the user, because I can't simply supply the encoded value to the browser.  </s>

<s> Having the KEY only helps if it's less easy to access than the password files (for the threat you point out).  </s>
<s> So, how does the server know the KEY?  </s>
<s> It's in a .conf  </s>
<s> file somewhere, or it's input on startup.  </s>
<s> If it's really a key and not a password, the latter will never fly.  </s>
<s> And actually, if given an option, most sites would take the .conf  </s>
<s> file anyway.  </s>
<s> Which would mean it was only in memory.  </s>
<s> Reading memory on a multi-user machine may be slightly harder to do than reading a protected file, but the threats are pretty close.  </s>
