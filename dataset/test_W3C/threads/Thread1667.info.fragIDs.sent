<s> Is the terminology below correct?  </s>
<s> User agent (UA) A module which communicates with a user through a user interface, and performs network operations, possibly connecting to one or more servers, to satisfy user requests.  </s>
<s> Service agent (SA) An agent which performs services, either in the background or at the request of User Agents.  </s>
<s> Client A process which opens connections to servers, and gives commands to them and gets the results.  </s>
<s> Server A process which accepts connections from clients and either accepts and performs them, or refuses them.  </s>
<s> Important in the terminology above is the distinction between "client" and "user agent".  </s>
<s> User agents are usually clients, but all clients are not user agents.  </s>
<s> If this is the right terminology, what is then the correct word for an HTTP server which provides interactive services using HTML forms?  </s>
<s> From an HTTP viewpoint, such a server is a server and not a client.  </s>
<s> But from an application viewpoint, it is a user agent.  </s>
<s> So a user agent can be a server.  </s>

<s> words like "client" and "server" and "user agent" are inherently fuzzy, and are generally meaningless unless you at least say "relative to what?" so yes, a user agent can be a client, or a server, or both.  </s>
<s> Keith  </s>
<s> Your terminology for "User Agent" tends to cast it in an active role ("performs network services"), which I think would also make it a "client".  </s>
<s> (Similarly, your definition of "service" agent seems to imply a passive role.) I am reminded of the classic case of the X-window terminal that is also a "server".  </s>
<s> But is it a "User agent"?  </s>
<s> I'm dubious (based on your definitions, it seems not).  </s>
