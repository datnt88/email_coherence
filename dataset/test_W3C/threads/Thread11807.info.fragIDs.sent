<s> Of course it is vital that authoring tools produce accessible output but it is way past time that we shut out this section of the population by making efforts to enable them to to use the tools somehow be considered of "lower priority" - this is unacceptable not only to me but also to "the people" as expressed in a series of laws *requiring* accessibility - not just in the U.S. but all over the world.  </s>

<s> At the face to face meeting we resolved to highlight the most important points of general accessible software design in the introduction to what is now section 3, and to make it clear that many of the basic requirements were dealt with in other documents to which we would refer.  </s>
<s> Are you proposing this addendum as part of such an introduction (which I think is a sensible opint to include)?  </s>
<s> This is the assumption I am using in drawing up the agenda.  </s>
<s> I would add to mouseless operation the requirement to implement appropriate interfaces for assistive technologies, and the requirement to implement software in accordance with Operating System conventions.  </s>
<s> The other point I think is important is the need to have a User Interface which is not dependent on visual rendering.  </s>
<s> As well as being covered in other guidelines it seems that this is implicit in the requirements for authoring-tool specific needs, so I would propose not including this point in such an introduction.  </s>
