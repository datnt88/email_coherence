<s> Hi, Section 1.6 of the DeltaV specification defines how the pre and post condition XML elements should be returned.  </s>
<s> It says: "the appropriate XML element MUST be returned as the child of a top-level DAV:error element in the response body, unless otherwise negotiated by the request.  </s>
<s> In a 207 Multi-Status response, the DAV:error element would appear in the appropriate DAV:responsedescription element."  </s>
<s> This is the only definiton of DAV:error, there is no DTD for this element as far as I can tell and no examples of it's use within a multistatus response.  </s>
<s> It would seem to violate the DTD defined in RFC2518 for DAV:responsedescription. Am I correct in thinking that the syntax should be: Label specified does not exist The human readable text describing the error and the DAV:error element are children of the DAV:responsedescription element.  </s>

<s> The rationale for putting it in the DAV:responsedescription node is that the DAV:responsedescription corresponds to the "body" of a non-multi-status response, and that is where the DAV:error node appears in a non-multi-status response.  </s>
<s> This does not violate the DTD for DAV:responsedescription, because a client is required to ignore any node that it doesn't understand, so it doesn't matter where you put it.  </s>

<s> I agree that if DeltaV had a DTD for DAV:responsedescription, then it should take the form that you describe below, but my point was that this does not violate the 2518 DTD for DAV:responsedescription, because you would first strip out all "unknown" element types (such as DAV:error) before checking it against the 2518 DTD.  </s>
