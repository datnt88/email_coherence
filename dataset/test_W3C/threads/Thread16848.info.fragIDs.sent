<s> Hi All, I've been asked to answer a couple of points regarding website accessibility  </s>
<s> for some potential business.  </s>
<s> Social inclusion pleasantly being an imporant  </s>
<s> aspect of the development.  </s>
<s> I found myself starting off initially with the  </s>
<s> somewhat unqualified statement:  </s>
<s> "It is widely accepted by the accessibility communitee that it is not currently realistic to sensibly provide a fully accessible solution to this  </s>
<s> problem for all social groups at this time".  </s>
<s> The problem being a web portal comprising numerous backend systems which  </s>
<s> come together to deliver dynamic content potentially in a variety of formats  </s>
<s> and using a variety of media.  </s>
<s> Even if we reduce the problem to a straight  </s>
<s> forward online flight booking system for example I personally don't believe  </s>
<s> it is possible to cater for all sensibly at this time?  </s>
<s> Just taking the visually impared and learning disabilities alone I feel moves the problem  </s>
<s> into potentially two separate solutions with the VI requiring textual feedback and learning disabilities perhaps more familiar with some kind of  </s>
<s> SVG approach?  </s>
<s> And if people with learning disability happen to come from a  </s>
<s> deprived social background then they may not even have access to a suitably enabled browser.  </s>
<s> I'm not necessarily saying it can't be done, just that it is currently unrealistic (or perhaps I should use "commerically viable" here!!! and stop beating around the bush) to expect access for all.  </s>
<s> I'm a little unconfortable saying that really and I'm sure that given enough time and money even today it would potentially be possible to produce a fully accessible site.  </s>
<s> But we hever have enough time or money do we?  </s>
<s> I just felt it would be helpful to start off my work with a can't please all of the people all of the time but... and concentrating on what we can do rather than adding exceptions to everything I suggest.  </s>
<s> Feedback as ever very much appreciated.  </s>

<s> If you look at WCAG 1.0 or Section 508, then is undoubtedly true.  </s>
<s> Adherence to either places a much lower priority on the needs of some groups than on others, and also sets up a competition between the needs of some groups and the needs of others.  </s>
<s> So I would say this is a legitimate statement.  </s>
<s> This is why an adaptive/transformative approach is most valuable.  </s>
<s> The idea that all users can be equally served by a single user interface is one which should have died years ago.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it's 2002 now and we have yet to see fully-deployed increased accessibility adaptive transformations.  </s>
<s> :( You have accurately identified a weakness in current accessibility thinking.  </s>
<s> The solution, as I see it, is to change our thinking and realize that multiple interfaces need to be constructed.  </s>
<s> If you are already assembling a portal system which separates the business logic (backend) from the front (dynamic content) then you are already advantaged when it comes to building a functioning adaptive transformation system.  </s>
<s> You can get better results for a broader group of users by creating multiple templates which meet a diversity of needs.  </s>

<s> The basic fact that you cannot make your web offering usable by 100% of everyone is just true.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, for the kind of system you are contemplating, there are things to consider that will make a big difference in who can and cannot use the result.  </s>
<s> The fact that some of us think you can reach more of everyone with pattern-generated alternative forms from the servers is partly why the openness to "server-side diversity" is still in WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> And in your situation where you are joining information services from multiple backends, there is cause to question why you cannot support multiple frontends as well.  </s>
<s> You have the uncomfortable opportunity to lead the charge _for_ information integration across the services coming from the multiple backends and _against_ creating a system of plumbing stovepipes for inaccessible media channels pasted together in the pixel domain.  </s>
<s> If you design the voice interface to each backend service first, you may be surprised at how easy and how adaptive the fleximode composite actually is.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> or we could just multiply the thinking and take all the best known strategies and follow them.  </s>
<s> I will never understand how a system will deliver the just right choice.  </s>
