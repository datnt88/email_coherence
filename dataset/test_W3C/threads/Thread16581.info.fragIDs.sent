<s> By the way, on my personal web site (http://kynn.com/),  </s>
<s> I use  </s>
<s> text + HTML + CSS to create a "WCAG button" instead of the graphic provided by the WAI for that purpose.  </s>
<s> Anyone want to argue that I've proven that the WAI graphic  </s>
<s> itself violates this checkpoint?  </s>
<s> :) There _is_ definitely an argument to be made, but I am not convinced of it.  </s>
<s> ;) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> [DJW:] As I see it, level 1 gives a lot of tolerance to typical commercial use of HTML as a page description language, but levels 2 and 3 require more and more rigid adherence to the orginal philosophy of HTML as an information markup language.  </s>
<s> As such, the fact that this requirement is at level two makes me think it is meant to be taken fairly literally.  </s>
<s> Modern HTML plus style sheets allows a lot of input to the visual styling without having to use GIFs of the text (although there are problems, like intellectual property restrictions on scaleable fonts, and the lack of a clean fallback mechanism for BUTTON elements, and broken implementation of, at least, the latter).  </s>
<s> Actually, even from the point of view of someone with adequate vision and 128K+ access to the net, text as  </s>
<s> graphics is almost always a barrier to access to the site  </s>
<s> because of the time it takes to load on the first access to the page.  </s>
<s> [DJW:] It's definitely a barrier, and I would say it was even a significant one - in any case, HTML requires that the image have alternate text, which should avoid that scrolling in text only mode.  </s>
<s> I think you are taking a line that is halfway between that which was intended by the guidelines, and that taken by a couple of my colleagues when told about the Olympics and AOL cases, namely that forcing commercial organisations to support the last 20% of the market was an unwarranted intrusion on their ability to operate their businesses.  </s>

<s> There are huge problems with using HTML + CSS as a substitute for graphical buttons; namely, they don't work.  </s>
<s> CSS has yet to be  </s>
<s> well-supported enough to be a legitimate substitute for textual buttons out in the "real world", apart from the ivory towers of research and scholarship.  </s>
<s> CSS is unreliable, and the needs of web designers (and site operators) to maintain a specific visual appearance cannot simply be written off as unimportant.  </s>
<s> If we tell them that _their_ concerns are worthless (and they must use an inferior solution to get limited results) then they will tell us that _our_ concerns are worthless and will not design with accessibility in mind.  </s>
<s> The more we say "don't do what you want to do, try this instead, even though it doesn't work" the less credibility we have.  </s>
<s> If we make unreasonable demands we will _not_ be listened to, and I feel that the idea that _all_ textual images are "evil" is a very unreasonable standpoint since there are no valid alternatives which meet the needs of the visual designers.  </s>
<s> That's not a barrier, that's simply poor use of your user agent software.  </s>
<s> If you want a faster loading page, then don't load images -- there's a switch on _your_ software to do this.  </s>
<s> Most users do not consider download time as a "barrier" to access; it is expected that web pages will take a while to load, especially on relatively slow connections.  </s>
<s> Your suggestion would seem to indicate that any graphics are a "barrier" because they may add a few seconds to download time.  </s>
<s> That's unreasonable.  </s>
<s> That's not a barrier; it's barely even a speedbump.  </s>
<s> It's not a "barrier."  </s>
<s> Your colleagues may be thinking realistically; such concerns cannot simply be written off, they must be addressed.  </s>
<s> They are not addressed by viewpoints such as "all graphical text is inaccessible" which require the use of defective technology to achieve poor results.  </s>
<s> --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> [DJW:] I tend to agree with this as well.  </s>
<s> CSS failed to achieve its aims because there was no commercial imperative to implement it completely and accurately, but there was one to implement certain features.  </s>
<s> As a result, it is one more thing that one was to allow for and work round broken and incomplete implementations that will mean that CSS will never fulfill its aims until most current GUI browsers have disappeared.  </s>
<s> (However, I'm fairly sure that custom fonts, one of the main reasons for text as graphics, will degrade gracefully even across broken CSS implementations.) BUTTON was always ill conceived, because of the lack of backward compatibility, and because the market had already settled on less structured solutions, even before IE4 mis-implemented it (I actually tested HTML to be used for an exhibition in an HTML 4 only envrionment on Lynx, and had the buttons work, only to find that they didn't work with IE!) The market is also concerned about backward compatibility to Netscape.  </s>

<s> Later in the guidelines it says "avoid causing the screen to flicker" [priority 1] to avoid seizures from photosensitive epilepsy.  </s>
<s> This suggests that "avoid X" really does mean "don't to X".  </s>
<s> I agree, but I don't think that using real text instead of a button is designing strictly for people with disabilities, certainly in those cases where the appearance is essentially the same.  </s>
<s> Not all sites have the links at the bottom.  </s>
<s> For example, site... in fact I think it's a good, clear layout.  </s>
<s> It's just like, as in many sites, it missed the chance to use real text instead of images.  </s>
<s> Real text would have made little visual difference...  </s>
<s> In fact, it would have enhanced the look...the text would have been more crisp I think.  </s>
<s> Text links at the bottom would have taken away from the visual appeal of the page, another reason to simply use text in the menu bar.  </s>
<s> And even if sites did use links, they are not as good as the buttons for people who can see buttons, at least for sites with good visual design.  </s>
<s> Well designed graphics organize the links in a way that a mere unformatted rows of text links do not.  </s>
<s> For example, I think the layout of activematter.com,  </s>
<s> including it's use of the folder tab metaphor is a good example of how visual layout can help usability.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see the benefits of that sort of good visual design available to as many people as possible, including people with low vision.  </s>
