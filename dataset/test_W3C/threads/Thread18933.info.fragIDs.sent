<s> Checkpoint 3.3 says Use style sheets to control layout and presentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] For example, use the CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT element to contro font styles.  </s>
<s> This implies that we should not do the following I don't see any practical consequences of doing this.  </s>
<s> We're specifying the logical classification of the text via H1. Screenreaders will ignore the font.  </s>
<s> People with low vision can override the font.  </s>
<s> So what's the harm?  </s>
<s> I don't think we should rule out such cases.  </s>
<s> There's just one problem I can think of, a bug in some versions of Navigator that don't fully override colors, even though there's a menu item to do that.  </s>
<s> I've come across that in the past.  </s>
<s> But at most, that means that you should precede this with "Until user agents fix bugs in allowing users to override font sizes and colors....".  </s>
<s> And even then, do we know that style sheet override doesn't have bugs of it's own?  </s>
<s> Plus, even though we have to worry about features that are just plain absent, I don't think we should worry too much about every bug in every browser or screenreader... the added complexity and just isn't worth it I think.  </s>

<s> I almost agree.  </s>
<s> The same reasoning applies to using color for meaning: great, as long as you also convey the meaning through other means.  </s>
<s> However, for the case you site, no specification ensures that users can override the font.  </s>
<s> Browsers may do this, but the HTML spec does not require or guarantee this.  </s>
<s> CSS describes an override mechanism,  </s>
<s> hence the promotion of CSS.  </s>
<s> Note that I have no objection to the above HTML in addition to CSS, since CSS suggestions (though sadly does not require) that CSS-enabled user agents make CSS style higher precedence in the cascade than markup language style.  </s>
<s> There are other reasons (not related to accessibilty) to avoid FONT and to use STYLE or external style sheets instead, such as page/site management.  </s>

<s> Ian, Thanks for pointing that out.  </s>
<s> That's an even stronger reason to go with style, stronger than what I discovered about netscape navigator.. that even the 4.7 version doesn't allow complete override--even to the extent implied by their edit preferences.  </s>
<s> So I withdraw my suggestion that font be allowed inside structural elements.  </s>
