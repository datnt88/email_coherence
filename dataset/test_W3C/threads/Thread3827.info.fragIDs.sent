<s> All, a reminder that our next meeting is tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Following a suggestion from Bjoern, we now have a drafty wiki page for QA-dev, where we'll be able to all read/edit agenda, action items, etc.  </s>
<s> For the reference, tomorrow's meeting will be held - 16:30 UK, - 17:30 France / Germany / Norway, - 18:30 Finland, - 11:30 Montreal (I'm in Montreal/Boston this week) olivier  </s>
<s> Point of order: I just corrected a typo on there (under 1.4.2 you had  </s>
<s> "Mew interface"), and it made no attempt to verify who I am.  </s>
<s> That  </s>
<s> seems to me perhaps excessively open.  </s>
<s> BTW, on action items, I've installed mod_validator @qa-dev, but have a few problems with it.  </s>
<s> Watch this space.  </s>
<s> Nick Kew Nick's manifesto: http://www.htmlhelp.com/~nick/  </s>
<s> It did log who you were (your host at least) and kept a diff.  </s>
<s> That seems to me perhaps excessively open.  </s>
<s> That's the idea of a wiki, yes.  </s>
<s> Excessively open, which is generally ok for some types of content.  </s>

<s> Summary of new Action Items: Action Item (Ville): send 0.6.6 bug roundup/status/plan - qa-dev Action Item (olivier): harmonization of checklink's layout based on current markup validator Summary of discussions: * Markup Validator New design caused a lot of reactions - good and bad -. Style can be improved still, and we will welcome suggestions, although small modifications will be much more likely to be accepted than larger, radical re-designs, and as usual, it's best to submit a patch.  </s>
<s> ,text and ,tablin in Jump bar not very popular, they'll be replaced as we move toward better multiple output.  </s>
<s> Some discussion on using XSLT for that, Bjoern/Nick interested in doing it, though no immediate plan to do this before we complete modularization.  </s>
<s> - 0.6.6 release within 1/2 weeks (without beta), including minor fixes.  </s>
<s> Ville will lead the bug roundup.  </s>
<s> - 0.6.5 merged with HEAD (with template code), result in the process of being fixed.  </s>
<s> - goal for 0.7: get rid of all inline HTML not needed - modularization is next big goal * Link Checker A few bugs left to fix, and the interface to be modified to be reasonably consistent with Markup Validator, then we'll proceed with a release * Others Bugzilla will be upgraded soon, then CVSWeb (Ville and olivier to coordinate) Log attached, as usual.  </s>
