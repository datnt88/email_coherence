<s> The protocol seems to allow a workspace to contain multiple bindings (names) for a single version-controlled resource.  </s>
<s> We're trying to understand how multiple bindings coexist with workspaces and baselines, for our implementation.  </s>
<s> The multiple bindings are introduced in the MERGE and UPDATE semantic additions of the VERSION-CONTROLLED-COLLECTION feature.  </s>
<s> The DAV:update-version-controlled-collection-members postcondition includes the following condition on new version-controlled member creation:  </s>
<s> If a new version-controlled member is in a workspace that already has a version-controlled resource for that version history, then the new version-controlled member MUST be just a binding (i.e. another name for) that existing version-controlled resource.  </s>
<s> And an earlier thread talked about UPDATE of a Version Controlled Configuration:  </s>
<s> Is This A Bug? - Baseline feature: Is it possible to construct a workspace which contains multiple VCR's with different DAV:checked-in versions for a given VHR by doing a MOVE of a VCR from one baseline-controlled collection to another, and then UPDATING the VCC's for those BCC's?  </s>
<s> I think the intent of the spec is clear (only one VCC for a given version history in a given workspace), but I agree that we are missing a postcondition on the MOVE operation.  </s>
<s> A workspace is required to have only one VCR for a given version history, so any operation that would violate that constraint (which a MOVE could) should fail.  </s>
<s> Similarly, we should clarify in the extended UPDATE semantics, so that it is clear that the UPDATE of a VCC causes an existing VCR to be bound into a collection, if there already is a VCR for a given version history in the workspace.  </s>
<s> I interpreted the last sentence of the reply to mean that the DAV:set-baseline-controlled-collection-members postcondition added by BASELINE to UPDATE (and MERGE), should include a statement similar to that in DAV:update-version-controlled-collection-members, requiring the creation of a binding to an existing VCR in the workspace.  </s>
<s> Is this the right interpretation?  </s>
<s> Is it also right to imply that the DAV:checked-in version of the VCR (assuming that it is checked-in) remains as it was preceding the MERGE / UPDATE, in particular the DAV:checked-in version does _not_ necessarily match the version held in the baseline?  </s>
<s> Should there be a similar extension to the DAV:select-existing-baseline postcondition?  </s>
<s> This would cover the case of initializing a collection from an existing baseline, where the collection is a member of a workspace, and both the workspace and baseline contain VCRs for the same version history.  </s>
<s> Also, how should BASELINE-CONTROL behave on a workspace containing such duplicate bindings?  </s>
<s> For example, suppose a workspace contains /ws/cmp1/src/foo.html and /ws/cmp2/src/bar.html, and that /ws/cmp2/src/bar.html is a binding (another name for) the resource, /ws/cmp1/src/foo.html.  </s>
<s> If you first BASELINE-CONTROL /ws/cmp1, and then BASELINE-CONTROL /ws/cmp2, should the second BASELINE-CONTROL operation omit the VCR identified by /ws/cmp2/src/bar.html  </s>
<s> (because it is already a member of a configuration created by baseline-controlling /ws/cmp1)?  </s>
<s> If it is omitted, then it seems like the baseline of cmp2 has lost some important information about the structure of component 2 (cmp2).  </s>
<s> If it is not omitted, then it seems to conflict with the description of configuration membership.  </s>
