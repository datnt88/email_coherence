<s> Hi, I disagree that there is a requirement for some automation in 4.1, since to me that suggests that prompting the authro for everything is not sufficient to meet the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> For the rest I propose we incorporate as is.  </s>

<s> Hi Charles, Actually, maybe we may need to re-think this checkpoint a bit.  </s>
<s> "Check for and inform the author" seems to me to imply al least some level of task automation on the part of the tool.  </s>
<s> But how much?  </s>
<s> I think we would all agree that it is not sufficient to put the full WCAG guideines and relevant techniques into the tool's help section for the author's reference.  </s>
<s> But, at the same time, we don't want to require that everything be automated, since some of the WCAG guidelines are not reasonably machine checkable at the current time.  </s>
<s> In your message, you mention "prompting for everything" should be sufficient to meet the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Do you mean asking the user to perform a number of specific manual checks?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) University of Toronto jan.richards@utoronto.ca  </s>
<s> The minimum would be to ask the author to perform manual checks for each WCAG item (at the various priority levels).  </s>
<s> I agree that that would result in a horrid tool, but it would do the job better than many things people are using at the moment.  </s>
<s> One optimisation would be to customise the checks.  </s>
<s> Another is to automate parts of them.  </s>
<s> A good tool will do some of both and more besides.  </s>
<s> And the question of what part of the workflow this happens at is orthogonal - if it happens the tool can pass, if it doesn't the tool fails, and if it has to be configured to happen then the tool can only pass in that configuration.  </s>

<s> Just a few questions: 1. Must a compliant tool start the check on its own?  </s>
<s> (i.e. after a save, before publishing, on the 27th minute of editing, etc.) Or is it sufficient to have a "Check Accessibility" item in the menu, or even a "How to check accessibility" section in somewhere in the Help.  </s>
<s> 2. Is it sufficient to provide a copy of the applicable WCAG techniques document?  </s>
<s> Or would a compliant system re-work the techniques to make it easier to manually check one after another?  </s>
<s> 3. How is the "inform" part done?  </s>
<s> Is this implicit in the fact that the author is the one who did the checks?  </s>
<s> Or should the tool allow the user to record the status of each manual check as it is done and then use this to inform them of the problems?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) University of Toronto jan.richards@utoronto.ca  </s>
<s> I think that a menu option to run the check is OK (but we should talk about that further I suspect).  </s>
<s> Having the stuff in help only is definitely not sufficient.  </s>
<s> I think that providing the manual checks prompting as the WCAG checklist is sufficient (but a pretty painful interface).  </s>
<s> Any good system (there are a few examples on the market) will do better than that, reworking the interface to suit the tool, and relating it correctly to the WCAG requirements.  </s>
<s> Where the user is required to participate in the testing the informing is done as part of that process, in general.  </s>
<s> Where there are automatic tests it must be by some other means... my 2 cents worth... Charles McCN Just a few questions: 1. Must a compliant tool start the check on its own?  </s>

<s> Jan asked some great questions, but I think we should discuss more on Mondays conference call.  </s>
<s> As for my 2 cents, I think having the information in help is the minimum for meeting 4.2 but that 4.1 does require automation.  </s>
<s> I'm also somewhat unclear about the benefits of prompting the user to perform a manual test.  </s>
