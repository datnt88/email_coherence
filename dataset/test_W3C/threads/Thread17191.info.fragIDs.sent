<s> from the outreach of today... what is the recommended way of creating high contrast icons??  </s>
<s> we use black on a transparent background, this results generally in black on white or neutral.  </s>
<s> However, when using ms high contrast, (control panel, accessibility) in black on black which is not terribly useful  </s>
<s> ideas please jonathan  </s>
<s> Black on transparent with a white border around the black might be worth experimenting with.  </s>
<s> I recommend not using transparency for icons, with the possible exception of a background that isn't what is internal to the icon, and where the outer border of the icon (minus the transparent background) isn't important anyway (for cases where it is the same colour as the user's background - similar to what you are getting on the high-contrast setting).  </s>
