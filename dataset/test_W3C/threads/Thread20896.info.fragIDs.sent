<s> I recently installed Amaya 7.0 via the RPM on its homepage, and when I try to run it, I get the following output:  </s>
<s> $ amaya libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.2.2 libpng warning: Application is running with png.c from libpng-1.0.13 libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library gdk_imlib ERROR: Cannot load image: /usr/share/Amaya/amaya/amaya.png  </s>
<s> All fallbacks failed.  </s>
<s> $ error *** A quick check of my libpng version gives this: $ rpm -q libpng libpng-1.2.2-6  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>
<s> -Joel  </s>
<s> I was getting that with earlier versions, on my RH7.2 system.  </s>
<s> So I started compiling it from the source code.  </s>
<s> Ever since I started doing that, I haven't had the problem.  </s>
<s> My guess is that compiling it yourself might be the best solution to the problem.  </s>

<s> Hello, Thanks for your bug reports.  </s>
<s> I'd been generating the RPM file on a Debian box.  </s>
<s> This had worked well before, until now.  </s>
<s> Fixing this problem won't be easy.  </s>
<s> Rather than using all of imlib in the GTK version, some parts of Amaya use it and other parts make direct calls to libpng and libjpeg!  </s>
<s> We should have been making a direct call to imlib.  </s>
<s> I commited a first fix, so that the libjpeg and libpng include files correspond to the same libraries we're linking to.  </s>
<s> As you're already compiling your own version, maybe you or someone else in the list could contribute an RPM file for Amaya (compiled in a Redhat box).  </s>
<s> I can give you more instructions on how to generate it.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, we'll stop shipping the RPM file as it's not usable anyway in its present state.  </s>
