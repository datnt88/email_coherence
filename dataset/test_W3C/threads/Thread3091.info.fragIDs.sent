<s> I've had a go at doing a mapping between some topics from the topicexchange  </s>

<s> The mappings are online at What could such a mapping be used for?  </s>
<s> Well, for example, lets say I'm viewing the 'Matrix' channel on topicexchange.  </s>
<s> There could be a link from this page saying 'view relevant pages from dmoz'.  </s>
<s> The page at the end of this link could use the mapping to retrieve the pages from the dmoz categories that are most relevant to the 'Matrix' topic in topicexchange.  </s>
<s> Considering this kind of scenario, it occurs to me that there could be a strong argument for defining matches simply as a list, ordered by relevance.  </s>
<s> I'm going to call this an 'ordered' mapping.  </s>
<s> So I could represent the  </s>
<s> 'Matrix' mapping simply as ... Topic Exchange-- Open Directory The Matrix1.  </s>

<s> I see where you are going with 'ordered' mappings, but I wonder if your solution isn't a little brittle.  </s>
<s> I mean, having defined 6 ordered mappings, what happens when you need another, numbered say 3.5?  </s>
<s> A way round this would be to allow relationships between mappings.  </s>
<s> So a mapping to Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/ is 'better' than (more relevant than?  </s>

<s> The ordering does look like it could make life easier for app implementations, but-  </s>
<s> I don't think that would be a problem, simply insert the new mapping into the ordered list -the numbering isn't too important.  </s>
<s> But I think there are a couple of related issues - firstly the loss of the absolute relevance level (narrow-match, broad-match) might mean you end up with really weak matches being given the same significance as strong ones.  </s>
<s> This may not be an issue in practice - nearest is probably what you'd want while searching.  </s>
<s> The other potential issue is how to handle the matching up the taxo trees: relevance 1. Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/ 2. Arts/Movies/Titles/M 3. Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/ 4. Arts/Movies/Genres 5. Arts/Movies/  </s>
<s> Yep, that sounds like it could do the same job as the ordering in a (probably) more versatile fashion.  </s>
