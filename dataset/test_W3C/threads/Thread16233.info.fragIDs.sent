<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I agree that it's very important to have people monitoring policy development around technology and accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> But the main purpose of the WAI Interest Group list is not to monitor the development of U.S. policy or that of any other country, nor to berate people about policy actions taken or not in specific countries.  </s>
<s> Some non-W3C lists provide options to do that, and I think that there needs to be more people participating in technology policy monitoring and response on such lists.  </s>
<s> It's still useful to exchange information on this list about policy developments that may be informative for parallel developments in different countries or that others may want to look into, and yes, you (Mike) shared Cynthia's list of questions &amp; concerns on this list on Tuesday evening U.S. Eastern Time -- for a Wednesday vote in the U.S. House and a Thursday vote in the Senate, apparently, which doesn't give the people who are in a position to respond on policy issues in the U.S. much time to do so -- but that can sometimes still be accomplished with targeted calls or emails to policy advocates and others.  </s>
<s> W3C does not typically participate directly in policy development, nor does it monitor the language of such bills as they are in development.  </s>
<s> It does develop technologies that are sometimes referenced in such legislation.  </s>
<s> It's important that various networks of people monitor how the technology and the policy intersect, ask questions, and help develop a technical and a policy analysis and a timely response to particular problems.  </s>
<s> In looking at Cynthia's questions, one of the questions that I have is whether the US Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) wouldn't supercede the bill's apparent failure to address the need for accessible formats in completing electronic transactions, and whether this couldn't be clarified in a regulatory process.  </s>
<s> That's probably too detailed of a policy debate to get into on this list, but for those pursuing some follow-up on this issue it might be a question worth looking into.  </s>

<s> Mike, keep in mind that on an international list, not everyone here is going to be responsible for the laws in any given country.  </s>
<s> Also, in my opinion, there is not much that I -- as an American citizen in this case -- could do to affect such a law passing or not; in many cases (as with the CDA a few years ago) we just have to hope that the courts will be fairer than the legislature, especially during an election year.  </s>

<s> Kynn,  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Well, a comment on the side of optimism here for a moment -- it actually is not always so hard to have input into development of legislation.  </s>
<s> Some of  </s>
<s> the factors that help are timing and contacts -- passing along information and concerns to the right people at the right time, and that means being on top of legislative development in one's own country enough to know when it's time to look at something more closely and talk to people about it.  </s>
<s> But it's also really important to have a good analysis of what the potential issues are, in terms of technical and/or policy problems; ways that those issues can be addressed; and where possible the language one might use to fix an accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> A good analysis, along with suggestions for how to address any problems, is often welcomed by those developing legislation, if it comes at a time when it can still be incorporated.  </s>
<s> There's a network of policy advocates who can help develop and pass along messages on potential accessibility barriers -- barriers which are often accidental, arising from a lack of awareness of how technology and policy intersect.  </s>
<s> The problem is ensuring that enough people with technical expertise and people with policy expertise are working together to spot these issues early enough and develop responses.  </s>
<s> And I believe that that's do-able, within a number of countries, but that the bulk of that work needs to happen on country-specific technology policy lists.  </s>
