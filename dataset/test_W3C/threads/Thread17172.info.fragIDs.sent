<s> This is an interesting question.  </s>
<s> It makes very good sense to allow people who use sign language (or people who use graphic symbols) to communicate in their natural medium.  </s>
<s> And yes, in order to make this accessible, one of the requirements is to have a textual version available.  </s>
<s> This is actually technically reasonably straightforward for most existing symbolic languages (as used by people who cannot handle much text) - but I think that's an accident.  </s>
<s> These systems (Bliss, the software produced by widgit or WWAAC, etc) tend to provide a symbol for a word.  </s>
<s> The system can be made easily to provide an alt which is the relevant word or phrase - some do this better than others in practice of course.  </s>
<s> "Signed english" is similar - it uses sign language to replace english "text" more or less automatically, so such a system could easily generate the text as well as the signs.  </s>
<s> (As an aside, the same mechanisms will make VoiceXML a good way of producing visual interfaces for people who are Deaf, or prefer graphic interaction - and after all, ordering a pizza is something that many people can do by poiinting to the things they want even if they don't speak the language of the pizza company.  </s>
<s> Just think about selecting what you want in a shawarma if you don't speak arabic).  </s>
<s> The problem is that signed english is not popular with Deaf people.  </s>
<s> It uses english grammar and expression.  </s>
<s> Sign languages for the Deaf (I know of three used in english-speaking countries besides "signed english") normally have their own grammar and syntax, their own ways of adding emphasis or modifying the "tone" of a statement.  </s>
<s> They are generally recognised as being languages in their own right, and not just a pictorial representation of words in a spoken language.  </s>
<s> Which brings up all the problems associated with translation - it is not easy, and automatic translators are still quite primitive.  </s>
<s> This explains why sign language users (not all people who are deaf are sign users) generally prefer sign language interpretation to captioning - with captions they have to read what amounts to a foreign language, and reading text is not a skill that is easy to acquire without hearing (since it is based on an abstract representation of the sound of a language, whereas sign languages tend to be based on an abstract representation of visual experience of the world, and since sign languages generally don't have a written form).  </s>
<s> So being able to communicate in their own language, and not required to use a foreign language for chat systems etc is important.  </s>
<s> Note that typically this applies to the minority who lose their hearing before they learn to speak a language - people who are hearing impaired or lose their hearing later in life, tend to be more (or often only) proficient in a spoken/written language, so captions are indeed necessary.  </s>

<s> Hold on a sec -- let's not make the jump from "a Deaf organization has bad programming" to "man, Web accessibility for the deaf is STUPID."  </s>
<s> It is not hard to find media accessible to the deaf that aren't accessible to anyone else.  </s>
<s> And deaf people are often quite happy to live with that.  </s>
<s> A current example is first-run movies with captioning only and no description.  </s>
<s> Even after bringing up the issue on my site and the Captioning list, I have seen no movement whatsoever among deaf and hard-of-hearing moviegoers to lobby studios to provide *full* accessibility.  </s>
<s> If I recall correctly, the National Association of the Deaf has supported description requirements on television.  </s>
<s> By no means is it universal that deaf groups are happy to have their accessibility needs met without due concern for everybody else's.  </s>
<s> It is, however, a trend I have noticed over the years.  </s>
<s> Thus it is not really surprising that a site built to be accessible to deaf people would fail rudimentary accessibility standards, like at least letting me into the site to look at it.  </s>
<s> One example of the problem is that WAI, WCAG 1.0, WCAG 2.0, _Building Accessible Websites_, and generally all other accessibility resources (including my own) have done little to address the needs of Deaf users for whom signing is easier than written English.  </s>
<s> In a multimedia environment such as the Web, this is the kind of thing that could be developed, but there has been almost no attention paid by the Web accessibility community to signed communication.  </s>
<s> There is reason to believe that provision of, say, captioning is not equivalent to provision of sign language, the latter of which is a translation.  </s>
<s> Once you go down that path, Ukrainian-speakers could legitimately argue that their inability to understand English-language sites requires accommodation.  </s>
<s> I actually have considerable sympathy for this position, but the provision of sign language, since it requires a translation (unique among accessibility provisions), *is* different.  </s>
<s> One could reasonably question what should be done with sign-language videos to make them accessible.  </s>
<s> Some deaf people would argue they already are, but that is easy to disprove.  </s>
<s> Do we need an interpreter to translate or retranslate the sign back to a spoken language?  </s>
<s> If so, then we must add captions.  </s>
<s> (If the video already has an interpreter or voice, it isn't open to discussion.  </s>
<s> You *have* to have captions.) Do we simply insist that sign-language videos also come equipped with captions?  </s>
<s> Then we're demanding a translation, which we do not do anywhere else, not even in foreign-language passages within Web pages.  </s>
<s> Do SL videos require audio description?  </s>
<s> I have a reasonably good links list of sign-language videos online and can attest that no immediately obvious answers have emerged.  </s>
<s> If this is the sort of issues that WAI has overlooked, well, we can just add it to the list of such issues.  </s>
<s> And also, should anyone be interested, the reason why I have emphasized captioning over sign language as an accessibility method for lo these 20 years is because the source of nearly all film and video found everywhere is voice.  </s>
<s> Captions are in the same language.  </s>
<s> The issue of translations is significant.  </s>
<s> I am not in favour of a sign-language translation of an audiovisual work as a first choice.  </s>
<s> I am of course aware of the SL requirements in the United Kingdom, and am perfectly happy to support the inclusion of sign language in audiovisual works as long as captioning is also provided.  </s>

<s> knowledge of Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> If they don't know, it is as likely "our" fault [our = "experienced Web developers who know better"] as theirs.  </s>
<s> No. It's incumbent on the Web author to provide accessibility.  </s>
<s> It would be tokenism to suggest that sites *for* people with disabilities should be made accessible first or must always meet Priority 3 guidelines, for example, but it is an absolute *must* that all disability-related sites meet minimum accessibility requirements.  </s>
<s> It's the author's responsibility first.  </s>
<s> WCAG 1.0, however inadequate it may be, has been published since 1999.  </s>
<s> This isn't a whole new concept.  </s>
<s> How many Deaf organizations, or companies serving Deaf organizations, are W3C members or are involved in the WAI?  </s>
<s> No such organizations appear to be members.  </s>
<s> How many WAI or W3C participants represent the needs of blind users?  </s>
<s> There's a disparity here, and the lack of information goes both ways.  </s>
<s> True. But blind users need a bigger boost than deaf users do.  </s>
<s> No doubt somebody will start shrieking about that statement, though it is obviously true.  </s>
<s> I urge the WAI folks, and others involved in Web accessibility education and outreach, to take this opportunity to contact Deaf organizations, including DeafPlanet, and ask them if we can work together to solve problems.  </s>
<s> I would suggest contacting DeafPlanet and insisting that their site be immediately upgraded to minimum standards (which could well include Flash accessibility).  </s>
<s> One might also press for an explanation as to why the site wasn't made accessible in the first place.  </s>
