<s> In Tim Ellison's review, he made one last plea to get rid of "members" (i.e. the ability to "slash through") collection versions (remember that the members of a collection version are required to be version history resources).  </s>
<s> Since Greg has indicated that although he will be supporting version-controlled collections, he will not be supporting slashing through a collection version, and since I don't really care, I propose we accept Tim's suggestion.  </s>
<s> Then instead of making version histories be members of collection versions, we would have a DAV:versioned-controlled-binding-set, PCDATA value: URL segment  </s>
<s> Greg: This means that you would edit the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of a working collection to move existing version-controlled-members into and out of that working collection.  </s>
<s> I assume that is fine with you?  </s>
<s> You would still add non-version-controlled members to that working collection if you wanted to create new version controlled resources.  </s>
<s> Greg, Tim (and anyone else who cares about vcc's): Please carefully review the version-controlled-collection option in the soon to be posted new draft.  </s>
<s> Does anyone object?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Hmm...  </s>
<s> I'm not too sure on this one.  </s>
<s> I don't do anything with collection versions themselves, but only with working collections.  </s>
<s> The operations there are: *) DELETE /working/collection/member *) MKCOL /working/collection/newcoll *) PUT /working/collection/newmember *) COPY /some/thing - /working/collection/newmember The COPY does the whole DAV:precursor-set thing.  </s>
<s> I never actually "move" something into a working collection, thus editing the binding doesn't apply to me.  </s>
<s> But!  </s>
<s> I get a sneaky feeling that the DELETE might not work properly.  </s>
<s> If the working collection had no members, then I'm guessing that I'd get a 404 on the delete.  </s>
<s> I'd be rather upset if I needed to PROPFIND/PROPPATCH to do a DELETE operation.  </s>
<s> (so consider that an objection if I'm correct in my thinking) Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/  </s>
<s> OK, Greg makes a good point that it is more convenient to do a DELETE than to have to lock some property value and update it.  </s>
<s> So I'll switch a working collection back to have history resources as members (which is probably better anyway, since it makes a working collection act much more like a checked-out version-controlled collection), but keep the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set for the collection version.  </s>
<s> I'll try to get this updated draft posted to the web site sometime late tonight.  </s>
