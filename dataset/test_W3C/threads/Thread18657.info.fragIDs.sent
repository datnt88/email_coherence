<s> So tell me this: why did you and the other programmers do work that you consider substandard?  </s>
<s> Ron Jeffries www.XProgramming.com  </s>
<s> For the simple reason that we are wimps ;-) Seriously, though I, and my fellow programmers are beginners at using the XP practices and we just crumbled under the pressure of delivering.  </s>
<s> One of my PMs says we would have finished this damn thing a long time ago if we?d just have solely used PL/SQL!!!  </s>
<s> When I talk about slowing down to go faster, my PMs just gawk at me.  </s>

<s> What's the "something else," the important thing that led you to deliver software that didn't meet your standards?  </s>
<s> The reason I ask is that maybe there's a way to get what you want, and also give your manager what she wants.  </s>
<s> The "something else" is, as I perceive it and hear it from my manager, delivering the needed business value at the right time.  </s>
<s> What does "delivering soon" do for your manager that's important to her?  </s>
<s> If you haven't asked her that, I'd like to hear your guesses.  </s>
<s> But then ask her.  </s>
<s> "Delivering soon" as you put it means delivering the needed business value  </s>
<s> on a specific date this year because if it isn?t then it won?t be put in use  </s>
<s> until next year.  </s>
<s> It?s important to my manager to make rather than break here  </s>
<s> as she sees it.  </s>

<s> In general, delivering something that works is better than delivering "business value" that doesn't work.  </s>
<s> I agree, but here it?s not a matter of working or not working it?s a matter of working with quality or without it.  </s>
<s> Quality here being linked to testing coverage and simple, changeable design.  </s>
<s> Anyway if you're doing XP you are always calibrating the 'what' with the delivery date...  </s>
<s> I get nervous when I hear words like "Business Value" or "Business Decision" without further explaination.  </s>
<s> Often they seem to be a proxy for "Just Because I said so..."  </s>
<s> Again I agree and that is what we did and are doing, but the problem we are facing is that we don?t seem to be able to find the right balance between the 'what' with superior quality and the delivery date.  </s>
