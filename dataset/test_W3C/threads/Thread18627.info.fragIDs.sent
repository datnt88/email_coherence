<s> Firstly, I must correct an error which was made in my previous message regarding dictionaries.  </s>
<s> Contrary to what I therein suggested, it is possible to have a general link type (rel="dictionary") and still ensure that a dictionary which is intended to control a speech synthesizer is only loaded by speech-based user agents: The user agent can then retrieve the dictionary and determine from the file format, which is yet to be defined, whether it contains phonetic data or abbreviations and their expansions.  </s>
<s> Now I would like to turn to the second issue, namely a possible ambiguity  </s>
<s> in the definition of the default media type.  </s>
<s> This working group has proposed, and the HTML/CSS working groups have accepted, that "screen" should be the default media type.  </s>
<s> This default gives a correct result when the target of the link is a style sheet: This refers to a CSS style sheet which, owing to the default media type of "screen", will be retrieved by the user agent and acted upon only if output is being directed to a screen display.  </s>
<s> However, in the section of the HTML 4.0 draft devoted to the LINK element, there are various other link types defined, for which a default media type of "screen" would be inappropriate.  </s>
<s> Thus: In this case, the default media type of "screen" should not be implied; the link to the table of contents is capable of being rendered in any medium.  </s>
<s> For example, a speech-based user agent might announce the title defined in the LINK element prior to rendering the text of the document.  </s>
<s> Thus, media="screen" should only be the default where rel="stylesheet" or rel="alternate stylesheet" Is this correct, or am I falling into error and confusion again?  </s>
<s> It's not clear to me that the 'media' rather than the 'class' attribute is better suited for that.  </s>
<s> As defined, the media range is not sufficient to convey all kind of dictionary types.  </s>
<s> Maybe these two are orthogonal in fact.  </s>
<s> Not at all, I think this is implied by the way the spec is organized (media types being defined in the SS section only) but this is worth the precision.  </s>
<s> The default media in the other case should probably be defined as "current".  </s>
<s> I agree, and also think that clarification of this issue in the spec is necessary.  </s>
<s> In the published draft, as part of the exposition of the LINK element, there is already an example similar to the following: which shows that MEDIA is of general application and not confined merely to style sheets.  </s>
<s> The use of CLASS to indicate the type of dictionary would be more precise than relying on the MEDIA attribute: provided that separate classes are defined so that the user agent can decide whether to load the dictionary or not in any given instance.  </s>
<s> However, what is the advantage of this strategy as compared with defining separate link types for each kind of dictionary?  </s>
<s> An abbreviation dictionary can be used not only by a speech synthesizer, but also as a means of establishing hypertext links between every occurrence of an abbreviation and its expansion.  </s>
<s> Thus, we should define different types of dictionaries rather than relying on the media attribute.  </s>
<s> The question which remains is thus whether CLASS or REL should carry the designation of the dictionary type.  </s>
