<s> Issue 1 Discussion: "Comments" section.  </s>
<s> I don't like the sentence that says: "We cannot guarantee a personal response but we will try when it is appropriate."  </s>
<s> Basically, this means: we can ignore your comment/request if we want, and that's not acceptable.  </s>
<s> We need to point people to an up-to-date "issue list" document where *all* the issues raised are stored  </s>
<s> together with their status (need more discussion, ok to be incorporated, no for this and this reason, etc) and their origination (author, date, pointer to message/thread).  </s>
<s> Action: The sentence was deleted.  </s>
<s> A document has been created in response to your request, from which this is excerpted.  </s>
<s> References: Issue 2  </s>
<s> Discussion: Comment1: Section 2 Recommendation 5. We should also add  </s>
<s> "descriptive link title", or "description anchor title" to disambiguate  </s>
<s> with the IMG title.(the  </s>
<s> example is clear, but it's dropped from the checklist for instance) Comment2: this might make the guideline confusing.  </s>
<s> The checklist is to remind them.  </s>
<s> The guidelines includes the example if there is confusion.  </s>
<s> Do you see it as a big problem?  </s>
<s> Action: no action taken at this time pending further discussion.  </s>
<s> References: Issue 3 Discussion: Section 12 Recommendation 12. Test the site with at least: a text only browser (such as Lynx) a self-voicing browser (such as PWWebspeak) I think requiring lynx is OK (given web ready lynx-it service) but self voicing is unrealistic.  </s>
<s> Action: Created a new bullet that says, "It may also be helpful to test your site with a self-voicing browser (such as PWWebspeak)."  </s>
<s> References: Issue 4 Discussion: We should probably advise people to use the OBJECT element and not APPLET.  </s>
<s> Action: Note added to recommendation concerning APPLET element that says it has been deprecated.  </s>

<s> Good. Could you give the URL ?  </s>
<s> (or put a link to it in the GL home page)  </s>
<s> Why would this make the guideline or checklist confusing since it adds more context ?  </s>
<s> I think there is a real risk of misunderstanding and using the IMG title.  </s>
<s> We will be posting the actionlog and latest working draft this afternoon.  </s>
<s> They will both be linked to from the GL home page.  </s>
<s> confusion.  </s>
