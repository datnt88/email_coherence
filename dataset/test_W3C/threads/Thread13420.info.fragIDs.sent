<s> If there are no objections, I'll mark the techniques 7.2.A and 7.3.A as 'discussion complete'.  </s>
<s> We now have a demo version of A-Prompt ready so that you can test the implementation of this technique.  </s>
<s> It's available at: This version is for evaluation by the list only and should not be distributed.  </s>
<s> Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments.  </s>
<s> I haven't heard anything about technique 7.3.B which deals with MARQUEES in SCRIPTS.  </s>

<s> I'd say 7.2.A and 7.3.A  </s>
<s> look fine.  </s>
<s> Re detecting Marquee-causing scripts in 7.3.B:  </s>
<s> There are various levels of sophistication of course and I'm sure our products will move up the ladder as time allows.  </s>
<s> If we're doing much parsing of script content at all, we should be able to detect the action of setting the value of, usually, a form  </s>
<s> control within a loop.  </s>
<s> Often this will be associated with a window.setTimeout()  </s>
<s> function.  </s>
<s> For instance, something like do {setTimeout("document.forms[0].elements[0].value  </s>
<s> = 'Scrolling Text'", 50);} while true; This syntax might not be 100% correct but is the general idea (not to mention that as the text doesn't change in each pass it wouldn't actually scroll in this example).  </s>
<s> The important feature is setting the value of a form control or possibly the content of a DIV section in an unterminated loop.  </s>
<s> Or, equally or more likely, would be a simpler syntax using the setInterval  </s>
<s> function, which doesn't require a loop: setInterval(document.forms[0].elements[0].value  </s>
<s> = 'Scrolling Text'", 50); Here, the important feature is that setting the value of the form control is  </s>
<s> an argument to the setInterval function rather than a statement in the loop,  </s>
<s> but these two should be equivalent and we could check for both.  </s>
<s> Of course, the statement that updates the value is most likely to be a function the user has declared elsewhere, so we would have to know to look at that function and see if it does that, so that's another level of complexity in reading the script.  </s>
<s> But if we're interested in it it's possible.  </s>

<s> Re: 7.3.B - Marquee SCRIPTS Thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> I'll leave this technique in the document, mark it as 'under discussion' and add your comments.  </s>
<s> We can come back to it as more information on scripts that cause marquees is uncovered.  </s>
