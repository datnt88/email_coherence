<s> just require pointing to the Level 1 DTD -- there are a few tweaks necessary for level 2, but not too much -- minimal effort to convert ~ 1 week.  </s>
<s> 2) DOM Level 1 Core (HTML only implementations) -- much more difficult, as the Level 1 XML tests would have to be converted -- these tests currently load an xml file and manipulate the file via dom calls.  </s>
<s> In order to convert, the xml file must be converted to an html file, and each of the tests would have to be changed.  </s>
<s> Most of the tests start with a getElementsByTagName call - these would have to be changed to be consistent with the HTML version of this file.  </s>
<s> Other tests try to get attributes from various element names -- I'm not sure the best way to represent this in HTML.  </s>
<s> So essentially the logic of these tests can be reused, but probably all of  </s>
