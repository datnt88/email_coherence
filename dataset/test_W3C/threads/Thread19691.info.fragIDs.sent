<s> Greetings, I only wanted to enquire whether the Amaya team has some automated tools for getting the Amaya document definitions from the HTML DTD, or whether this is done manually.  </s>

<s> Hi Sami,  </s>
<s> Amaya document definitions from the HTML DTD is done manually.  </s>
<s> During this phase, some elements and attributes are added to allow Amaya to edit documents.  </s>
<s> The HTML DTD doesn't take in account the editing needs.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Could you elaborate?  </s>
<s> I can assure you that the designers of the HTML DTD have made every effort to accomodate the needs of editing tools.  </s>
<s> If there is some reason why the HTML DTD doesn't fit into the Amaya architecture, we should fix that -- either by changing the HTML DTD or by changing Amaya.  </s>

<s> Hi Dan, Effectively, we need to introduce new elements and new attributes specifically for editing.  </s>
<s> Just some examples: - element "Invalid_element" to support any invalid element found in HTML documents.  </s>
<s> - attribute "Invalid_attribute" to support any invalid attribute found in HTML documents.  </s>
<s> - element "Radio_Input", "Checkbox_Input", "Text_Input", etc. to distinguish typed input elements which have different behaviors.  </s>
<s> - attribute "DefaultChecked" to distinguish the checked value given by the document author and the current user.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that it's a good idea to extend the HTML dtd with all these elements and attributes.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> I agree that it would be a bad idea.  </s>
