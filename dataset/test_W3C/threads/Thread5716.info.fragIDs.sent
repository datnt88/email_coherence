<s> Hi Phil, Nice to hear from you.  </s>
<s> I'd be happy to send information about our use of OWL, however I think they  </s>
<s> already have it since BioPAX (www.biopax.org) is already listed on the W3C site (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/impls#Implementations).  </s>
<s> That being  </s>
<s> said and assuming I can't help the cause in that way, and not wanting to  </s>
<s> break the chain so to speak, I am forwarding your message to Peter Karp and  </s>
<s> Holger Knublauch.  </s>
<s> Peter Karp, (SRI, International) is working on the release of an open source version of the GKB Editor with OWL support.  </s>
<s> Holger, as you know is the author of the OWL plugin for the Protege editor.  </s>
<s> Perhaps they would add the request to their download site and more users of OWL would know to send in their information.  </s>
<s> Warmest regards, Joanne Joanne Luciano BioPAX Workgroup Member BioPathways Consortium co-organizer 45 Orchard Street Belmont, MA 02478-3008 jluciano@biopathways.org  </s>
<s> Matt, Joanne  </s>
<s> From your respective talks at bio ontologies this year, I know that  </s>
<s> both of your groups are using, or are starting to use OWL within your projects.  </s>
<s> I'm forwarding a request from Jim Hendler, via Ian Horrocks, who are both members of the web ontology W3C group.  </s>
<s> They are trying to keep up with who is using OWL, and for what.  </s>
<s> An important part of the W3C process is having solid examples of where people are using the technology.  </s>
<s> They would be very grateful if you could forward a short message explaining what you are doing with OWL to their mailing list described below.  </s>
<s> Cheers Phil Ian It would be helpful if you or anyone you know who is using OWL Ian would post a brief message to public-webont-comments@w3.org Ian with a pointer or short explanation of the application.  </s>
<s> Ian Thanks, Ian Ian Ian From: Jim Hendler hendler@cs.umd.edu  </s>

<s> Ian Everyone - Ian this is REALLY important -- I've been running into more and Ian more Ian people who are actually using OWL and not telling anyone about Ian it -- I would like everyone in the WG to find someone you know Ian using OWL and tell them to send mail to Ian public-webont-comments@w3.org with a pointer to their Ian application.  </s>
<s> Then ask them to do the same... Ian Seriously, the W3C AC is currently being very tough on Ian Proposed Ian Recommendations, and I think our showing just how many people Ian are really using OWL at this point will help a tremendous Ian amount.  </s>
<s> Ian We must all spread the word that people shouldn't just be Ian using OWL, Ian but also letting us know that they are!  </s>

<s> Matt, Joanne  </s>
<s> From your respective talks at bio ontologies this year, I know that  </s>
<s> I have added a note to the main page of the OWL Plugin, and to the  </s>
<s> ontology library site: "Note: The WebOnt W3C working group would like to hear about projects  </s>
<s> that are using OWL ontologies.  </s>
<s> Please share your experience and link your project with the Semantic Web community by sending an email to the public-webont-comments@w3.org mailing list."  </s>
<s> Hope that helps Holger  </s>
<s> FYI, The download page for BioPAX now also contains the following note The asterisk appears above this text where the OWL version of BioPAX and the Protege OWL plugin are mentioned.  </s>
