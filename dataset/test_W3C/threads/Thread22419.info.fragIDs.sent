<s> Second, the API must be generally backward compatible with Netscape Navigator and MS Internet Explorer for obvious reasons.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking,  </s>
<s> we've tried to be compatible with "DOM Level 0", which is defined as that which was common between Navigator 3.0 and IE 3.0.  </s>
<s> This leads to some counter-intuitive constraints; for example, several concrete element types in HTML already have array semantics in the browsers' APIs.  </s>
<s> This prevents us from allowing the square bracket syntax for getting at children in  </s>
<s> ECMAScript; e.g. mychild = mynode[i] will not work.  </s>
<s> Thus, as I understand it, we MUST have a "HAS A" relationship between an Element and the collection of its children, not an "IS A" relationship between Element and a CompositeNode base class.  </s>
<s> Third, (although I realize some of you apparently disagree) we believe it is critical that the DOM "language neutral", i.e., that outside of unavoidable "language binding" issues, it be available in principle from widely-used programming languages like Java, (but including C/C++), script languages like ECMAScript (but also VBScript, Perl, Tcl, etc.), CORBA (but also COM), and anything else someone wants to write a binding for (e.g. Eiffel, Python, Scheme, etc.).  </s>
<s> This means that we can't use certain features of supported by many languages (such as multiple inheritance, or various types of name overloading) that sophisticated designers are used to.  </s>

<s> Mike, This is a good exposition of some of the constraints we face as a working group, and why we aren't always able to take what seems a logical path.  </s>
<s> I hope this explanation will help those who have been wondering; however, I also hope it won't be interpreted to mean that suggestions are unwelcome.  </s>
<s> Despite the occasional flame wars (which, fortunately, have been handled with reasonable professionalism) I think the large volume of comments, suggestions and debate is very healthy.  </s>
<s> The task we have undertaken is immense, and well-reasoned input is always worth listening to.  </s>

<s> Good message, but of course I have some comments.... Overall, I understand the constraints.  </s>
<s> However, this is a public mailing list, this is the forum for commenting on the standard, and as far as I know, the only way in which the standard has been presented to anyone outside the organizations collaborating to create the standard.  </s>
<s> Step back and look at the DOM as a product.  </s>
<s> This mailing list is a market research tool.  </s>
<s> Customers are telling you that the product is broken and are strongly encouraging you to modify your product.  </s>
<s> I can't resist commenting on this.  </s>
<s> Of course I understand the rationale here.  </s>
<s> flame But backward compatibility with products implementing a standard that doesn't yet exist?  </s>
<s> Seems kinda backward to me.  </s>
<s> A standard is meant to simplify development efforts for those using the standard--not just the implementors--but first the standard has to exist!  </s>
<s> Most customers understand and grudgingly accept incompatibilities in favor of standard implementations.  </s>
<s> If the existing implementations are broken when they evolve to support a NEW standard, customers may grumble, but they won't revolt.  </s>
<s> Especially if it means that they won't have to maintain multiple versions of their code (or pages or scripts).  </s>
<s> There are many examples of incompatibilities between the IE &amp; Netscape--many of which could and should be addressed by DOM--How are those incompatibilities being addressed while maintaining backward compatibility?  </s>
<s> /flame Ok, I feel better now.  </s>
<s> Could you explain this further?  </s>
<s> Since CompositeNode "HAS A" collection of children, if Element "IS A" CompositeNode, then it too "HAS A" collection of children... What is the difference between Element inheriting its child list from CompositeNode rather than Node?  </s>
<s> The proposal for a CompositeNode was meant to more accurately describe the constraint that there are node types that can't have children.  </s>
<s> If the CompositeNode interface is not implemented, then there should be a NotSupportedException specified on insertBefore() so that *correct* implementations can complain when I try to add an element to a comment.  </s>
<s> Yet another exception to catch...  </s>
<s> As a client, I would rather know at compile time that I can't perform an operation than wait to be informed via an exception at runtime.  </s>
<s> The argument to keep insufficient or incorrect abstractions in an API to satisfy vendors who happen to implement something similar is pretty weak.  </s>
<s> This is a standard that will hopefully have a long lifetime.  </s>
<s> Should defects be knowingly built into the first release?  </s>
<s> NodeIterator handles indexed access and iterators.  </s>
<s> Where is the associative array access?  </s>
<s> And if names should be descriptive, it should be called something other than Iterator--that name describes only a portion of its behavior.  </s>
<s> Again, for the ECMAScript/VBScript programmers out there, the name won't matter--they'll be using indexed access in the same way they do now, right?  </s>
<s> Good argument.  </s>
<s> I'll agree that multiple access methods are necessary.  </s>
<s> I just disagree on the way in which the DOM authors have chosen to provide those methods.  </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong--I know that the DOM in its current form is the result of a significant cooperative effort between companies that may also be competitors.  </s>
<s> Having participated in standards efforts in the past, I also understand the difficulty that was undoubtedly involved in creating the spec.  </s>
<s> And I think the spec is very close to being finished.  </s>
<s> It just needs a little tweaking here and there.  </s>
