<s> (I assume that i had to be subscribed to get this thru to the list, as the below is still not listed at subscribed; hopefully this'll work.) hi, I'm attempting to compile Amaya 5.1 on my RedHat Linux v6.2 (2.2.14-5.0 kernal).  </s>
<s> This is my system's first attempt at compiling Amaya; previously I installed Amaya via rpm.  </s>
<s> To satisfy Amaya's Motif prerequisite, I downloaded openmotif 2.1.30 (openmotif-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm and openmotif-devel-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm from ftp://openmotif.opengroup.org/pub/openmotif/R2.1.30/binaries/metrolink/) and installed these w/o error.  </s>
<s> However, # ../configure from LINUX-ELF directory still ends with: 'Motif seems not installed on this machine Amaya need Motif 1.2 or 2.0 Now start "make all" (GNU make preferably) to build the bianries'.  </s>
<s> So configure doesn't seem to recognize my OpenMotif.  </s>
<s> I also tried ../configure --with-gtk because "--with-gtk build Amaya using GTK, instead of Motif" makes it sound like Motif might not be needed.  </s>
<s> But the error's the same.  </s>
<s> After i installed the openmotif-devel-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm,  </s>
<s> # make all, instead of failing quickly with complaints of not finding, eg, "xm/ScrollBar.h", lasted ~10min.  </s>
<s> But it too eventually died, ending with: dialogapi.o(.text+0x70f0): undefined reference to `_XmStrings' dialogapi.o(.text+0x7195): undefined reference to `_XmStrings' dialogapi.o(.text+0x71a5): undefined reference to `_XmStrings' dialogapi.o(.text+0x71b2): undefined reference to `_XmStrings' keyboards.o(.text+0x6b7): undefined reference to `_XmStrings' keyboards.o(.text+0x739): undefined reference to `XmCreateDrawnButton' keyboards.o(.text+0x756): undefined reference to `_XmStrings' keyboards.o(.text+0x772): undefined reference to `_XmStrings' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status make[1]: *** [../bin/amaya] Error 1 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Amaya/LINUX-ELF/amaya'" I went back to the instructions.  </s>
<s> Options.orig file as needed".  </s>
<s> I think that should be the "Options" file, not "Options.orig".  </s>
<s> I edited the Options file to add MOTIF_INCLUDES=/usr/X11R6/include (MOTIF_LIBRARIES=/usr/X11R6/lib wasn't necessary as that directory is already showing up with make all's gcc -L).  </s>
<s> This didn't seem to help, though.  </s>
<s> Suggestions?  </s>
<s> thank u,  </s>
<s> george  </s>
<s> I solved this problem (on a pentium II) by upgrading from redhat 6.2 (kernal 2.2) to redhat 7.1 (kernal 2.4), uninstalling openMotif, intalling lesstif and amaya-5.0-1mdk.i586.rpm from rpmfind.net.  </s>
<s> I couldn't install the amaya packages i found on rpmfind.net  </s>
<s> w/o the OS  </s>
<s> upgrade bec all the .rpm's  </s>
<s> seem to be in the new format.  </s>
<s> (fyi: The redhat "upgrade" option seems pretty safe: it didn't break or overwrite any of my previously-installed sw.)  </s>
<s> i believe the amaya team may want to confirm that openmotif is ok for compiling amaya, and that the reference to Options.orig in the Unix instructions is accurate (vs Options; pls see my original post (7/13)).  </s>
<s> amaya's great, thx.  </s>
<s> george  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, some folks can't upgrade to RH7.1.  </s>
<s> I get a sig 11 every time I try; even though RH7 installs fine.  </s>
<s> I'm just back from vacation and I lost the context.  </s>
<s> What is exactly the trouble with the Amaya rpm distribution?  </s>
<s> It doesn't work with the current openMotif distribution?  </s>
