<s> I find no mention of this completed report on the WAI policy page.  </s>
<s> I have just downloaded it and find it important to list there.  </s>
<s> In our minutes Judy Brewer was to report on it.  </s>
<s> Did I miss it?  </s>
<s> Seems like that report will (if it hasn't already) become the basis for "law with teeth" to impose accessibility compliance for government procurements.  </s>
<s> Regards/Harvey  </s>
<s> Hi Harvey, There are several things on the policy page that need updating.  </s>
<s> You didn't miss it, but it isn't done yet, sorry.  </s>

<s> At I see that they reference WCAG rightly but for AU and UA, they just point to http://www.w3.org/TR (in 5.3.3.2 and 5.3.3.3)  </s>
<s> Isn't the case that we already have stable URL for both, i.e that we will still valid when the guidelines come out.  </s>
<s> Should we ask them to fix their document ?  </s>
