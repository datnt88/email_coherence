<s> I'm using Amaya for Solaris 2.5 and when I try to use: body{ background: blue / yellow } or body{ background: blue/yellow; bg-blend-direction: NW } I only get the first color -- the second doesn't blend in at all.  </s>

<s> Irene, Thank you for your reply.  </s>
<s> I read in several html 3.2 books that this feature would be part of the upcoming CSS1 implementation.  </s>
<s> Now that I have browsed the W3C website, under section 5.3 Color and background properties I see that this is not the case.  </s>
<s> I found this one of the most interesting features of background color properties, however, and am sorry to hear that it isn't included in CSS1.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it is something that the W3C will tackle in the near future?  </s>
<s> Once again, thank you for the quick response!  </s>
