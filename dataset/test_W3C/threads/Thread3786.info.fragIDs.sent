<s> Hi. I am currently working on a test suite for the Markup Validator, which will eventually be semi-automated through the use of the Log Validator.  </s>
<s> Currently the "suite" [1] is just a page with links pointing to either validation pages (using the test instance of the validator) or other "test suites", with notes about whether the page should validate or not, sometimes a description of what is being tested (XML, charset, etc).  </s>
<s> I would like to clean this up, bind it all using n3 and interface it with the Log Validator.  </s>
<s> [1] http://validator.w3.org/dev/tests/  </s>
<s> After a better look at how MUTAT [2] works, I started wondering whether we could actually use EARL for the test descriptions.  </s>
<s> [2] http://www.barbwired.com/nadiaweb/tester/  </s>
<s> (we have a version at  </s>
<s> w3.org but it doesn't work as well as this one, need to contact Nadiah  </s>
<s> about it) Indeed we have: - web resources (our test cases)  </s>
<s> - which we know is invalid "specX" or not - which is used to test this or that part of the validator (XML, SGML,  </s>
<s> charset, ...) - we know that for each of these test cases the current validator "gets it right" or not, which could certainly be expressed using EARL assertions.  </s>
<s> Without really wanting to start (again) a discussion about a generic Test Case Description Language, I was wondering if anyone more familiar with EARL and/or Test Cases would have comments and ideas about this.  </s>

<s> do you mean EARL for the report of passing the Test Suite?  </s>
<s> or to describe the test?  </s>
<s> We will have to consider something where the success of passing the test suite is not the fact of being valid.  </s>
<s> Test A - Has to be always invalid - Success if invalid - Failed if valid Test B - Has to be always valid - Success if invalid - Failed if invalid  </s>
<s> So I guess something like  </s>

<s> I put together some examples.  </s>
<s> It doesn't mean it has to be like that.  </s>
<s> :validatorResult points to an URI valid invalid nocharset  </s>
<s> Which is the expected result of the validator.  </s>
<s> So if the test says that the result should be "nocharset" and the validator validates the file without complaining about the charset.  </s>
<s> The test didn't pass.  </s>
<s> Are the information about the test itself should be inside the test itself?  </s>
<s> At first we could say yes thinking in terms of HTML, but it will mean we will have to define of describing metadata for each kind of markup.  </s>
<s> It might be easier to put this information in the n3 file.  </s>
<s> reference could be one or more reference to understand the context of the test itself.  </s>
<s> People who have submitted, references in the specs, discussions about the tests.  </s>
<s> There is quite a huge number of tests in the HTML 4.01 Test Suite as well.  </s>

<s> I meant to describe the test.  </s>
<s> Using as a basis for a Test Description Language, though obviously not its primary purpose, has some appeal, because most if not all of the needed concepts are there already.  </s>
<s> There is actually one more dimension, which is the "regular" result given by the current validator.  </s>
<s> I suppose we could keep those apart as a list of assertions with the assertor being http://validator.w3.org/check a earl:Tool.  </s>
<s> [snip] the example looks quite good.  </s>
<s> nocharset is included in invalid ;) I'd rather have the result be either valid or invalid, and add a result property stating why it wasinvalid (charset, doctype, etc.)  </s>
<s> I think so too.  </s>
<s> Besides for some tests we may want to have no test or comment whatsoever inside, to test a specific case.  </s>
<s> Then I would distinguish reference as in "Reference specification(s)" (may be multiple in case of mixed namespaces) and reference as in "see also".  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> We're definitely not lacking test documents, but we're seriously lacking some organization for them :) Thanks a lot, your examples and suggestions help me a lot.  </s>
