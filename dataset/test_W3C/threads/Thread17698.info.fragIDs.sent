<s> I have a few questions and comments regarding frames in relation to the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> Should the guidelines specify that the UA should provide access to the frame title and longdesc attributes, both of which are included in the page author guidelines?  </s>
<s> The way the guidelines are currently formatted it seems like this guideline should appear in 8.2 compatibility with HTML 4.0 but I wonder if we need a separate section on frames.  </s>
<s> 2. Will the mechanisms for providing direct access to elements change if the page is framed?  </s>
<s> I am just wondering if numbering links or searching for links and moving the selection /focus will be affected by the use of frames.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kitch  </s>
<s> For number 1, absolutely there should be implementation guidelines.  </s>
<s> For number 2, that's more difficult.  </s>
<s> First guess would be that frames are really separate browser windows and in the JScript/VBScript world, one frame does not know about another frame.  </s>
<s> Given that isolation, I'd say that the numbering of links would be consecutive within a frame.  </s>
<s> Focus can only be in one frame at a time, however selection can be in multiple frames (just like in Windows Explorer where you can tab between the Tree View and the List view.  </s>
<s> The selection remains in both panes (frames) but the focus is in the currently active pane (frame).  </s>
<s> FYI - once again this message almost didn't make it to the list because of the stupid way the W3C won't set the REPLY-ALL header.  </s>
<s> During the spell check I noticed the list was not on the TO: line.  </s>
<s> Last week one of my messages did not make it to the list and someone replied to one of my messages that maybe was intended for the list.  </s>

<s> I think focus and selection are closely analogous.  </s>
<s> Every context (pane) can have both a selection and a focus.  </s>
<s> However, the active pane has the active selection and active focus, and the other panes have inactive selection and active focus.  </s>
<s> When a pane loses activation, its focus and selection become inactive, and the pane that becomes active makes its selection and focus active.  </s>
<s> The important point is that both selection and focus can be remembered when the user moves to another pane and restored when the user comes back.  </s>
<s> This is how Windows Explorer, Word, etc. all work.  </s>
<s> That model works when the panes are really independent and have separate navigation ordering rather than the ordering flowing between panes.  </s>
<s> (Examples include the Windows Explorer, Word, dialog boxes in general, etc.) If TAB took you from the last object in one pane to the first in the next, then the idea of remembering focus breaks down.  </s>
<s> However, it still applies when moving to and from separate containers.  </s>

<s> It is easy to say what needs to happen when there are independent contents in two frames or when the two frames contain the same thing, just presented differently.  </s>
<s> In the future there are more general relationships that can exist in the information coverage of related frames.  </s>
<s> These could cause some but not all events to ripple between frames, as when one follows a hyperlink in a body frame that loads a new body frame; should the selection in the related Table of Contents frame be updated?  </s>
<s> At present we have two "discrepancy reports" against web technology which suggest a clearer and simpler sub-dialog management policy is needed: - It is too easy for people to get lost in framesets, with or without vision.  </s>
<s> - The rules for who can overwrite who in frames and SMIL are suspected of being neither powerful enough nor controlled enough.  </s>
<s> And we need a unified model.  </s>
<s> OOA may help us define that simpler policy.  </s>
