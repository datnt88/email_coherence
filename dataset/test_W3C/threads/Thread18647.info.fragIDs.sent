<s> value="...F3082010308201B002010..."/ The first key is carried in within a X.509 certificate.  </s>
<s> The second key is carried in a PGP certificate.  </s>
<s> I assume that you intend in this example for  </s>
<s> both certificates to carry the same public key.  </s>
<s> Evaluation of this signature will result in an ambiguos result.  </s>
<s> The validation processing for X.509 is very different from PGP.  </s>
<s> It is possible  </s>
<s> for one certificate to be revoked and the signature invalid and the second certificate to be valid.  </s>
<s> Even if both alternatives were in the same format, the associated  </s>
<s> attributes would be different (or else they would be the same certificate).  </s>
<s> Any variations in the certificate in name, validity period, key usage restrictions, or other attributes will effect the interpretation of the signature.  </s>
<s> Allowing multiple alternatives for a key will allow create scenarios with ambiguos signature interpretations.  </s>
<s> This example illustrates that a signing entity is more than just the public key.  </s>
<s> The validation processing of a digital signature must consider all of the originator information carried with the public key.  </s>
<s> We should include only one starting point for this validation process.  </s>
<s> So, I propose that: XML digital signatures must carry only a single originator key or certificate.  </s>

<s> Humm ... how do we develop a standard without any restrictions?  </s>
<s> How can we generate conformance tests?  </s>
<s> I agree that we can not prevent extensions and should even encourage flexibility, but we need to have some minimum syntax and some restrictions on the ways the syntax is used.  </s>
<s> I believe this is just a matter of specification approach and guidelines.  </s>
<s> This restriction on syntax is one of the reasons I'm pushing on differentiating the characteristics of a keyed hash versus public key mechanisms.  </s>

<s> I suggest adopting different markup.  </s>
<s> The syntax and semantics of a message protected by a keyed hash are different than a public key signature.  </s>
<s> The markup should clearly distinguish between these services.  </s>
