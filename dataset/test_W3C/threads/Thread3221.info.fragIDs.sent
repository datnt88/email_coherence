<s> Eric, The debug feature is really cool!  </s>
<s> While testing iggy I found couple of more bugs, some of which probably do not come from the server but I listed them here anyway: 1) I have problems in deleting already existing annotations.  </s>
<s> 2) Annotating and are different now.  </s>
<s> Earlier they were treated the same as they actually are the same file.  </s>
<s> Not sure if this is an iggy problem.  </s>
<s> 3) Cannot change the annotation or reply type anymore.  </s>
<s> But I don't think this has anything to do with iggy.  </s>
<s> 4) Also while this seems to not cause problems, Jose pointed out that the server replies HTTP/1.1 201 and not HTTP/1.1 201 Created as the protocol doc defines (http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html).  </s>

<s> Tested with annotations and replies.  </s>

<s> If not, I'll generate more and record IDs.  </s>
<s> At least some annotated  </s>

<s> This is document server configuration that the annotation server can't know anything about.  </s>
<s> I think Amaya may have had some special knowldege of the www.w3.org, but I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> That's not really up to the protocol doc to define -- that's the domain of the domain of the HTTP spec: [[ http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1.1  </s>
