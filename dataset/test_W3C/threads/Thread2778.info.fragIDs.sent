<s> Thanks, Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> The CGI spec (either the existing 1.1 spec or the new 1.2) just makes the method available to the program - if the program doesn't look, it doesn't.  </s>
<s> Some of the CGI libraries make this easy to do as well - parameters are parsed by the library from a GET query string or a POST body transparently, for example.  </s>
<s> I've tried bouncing TRACE and OPTIONS requests off various URLs that were obviously scripts and many respond as though the request were a GET.  </s>
<s> I just took a (very) quick peek at the Apache documentation for adding modules, and found a similar API - the method is passed by the server to the module, so the core server itself doesn't even appear to have a way to know what methods might be handled or not.  </s>
<s> Pretty good design if you are optimizing for flexibility.  </s>

<s> You are right - they indeed seem to be largely indifferent except that I see an added 100 code on PUTs and HEAD responses don't include a body.  </s>
<s> Sure if you have a way of describing what you mean by a new method and that you have a mechanism for ensuring that it is handled probably.  </s>
<s> The current situation is just a recipe for evolutional disaster in HTTP/1.x and it indeed breaks HTTP/1.1 for any method (including unknown ones) except GET, HEAD and POST.  </s>
<s> Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> The problem starts with the fact we've carefully never acknowledged the CGI interface as being part of HTTP.  </s>
<s> What I think is needed is a MUST requirement that a HTTP server never delegate handling of any method other then GET, HEAD, or POST to any part of the server which isn't known to understand / properly handle the unknown method.  </s>
<s> I think this requirement is implicit in the spec in any case so it isn't a protocol change.  </s>
<s> It does mean that a conforming HTTP/1.1 server can't handoff an unknown method to a CGI (or *API) program if there isn't some kind of configuration switch to prevent handing such requests to an old CGI program.  </s>
<s> With a server having the ability to distinguish 'old' methods from new methods and controlling which application code each will be sent to, the server can't even fix a failure by disabling the new methods from the old CGI.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> I think that crosses the line from being a protocol spec to being a functional spec for a server, which it should not try to be.  </s>
<s> There are few cases where we have put in requirements outside the wire protocol, but they are mostly governing caching to preserve correctness, or are related to the security behaviours.  </s>
<s> rom the point of view of this spec, "the server" is whatever is generating  </s>
<s> the response to a request - it encompasses the CGI or *API program, and those components are as much bound by its requirements as any other part.  </s>
<s> Yes, I understand the real world implications of this - and I believe that those working on a new CGI spec do too.  </s>

<s> OK, then lets stop worrying about the fact that servers invoke brain dead cgi programs.  </s>
<s> In any case, the requirement I suggested is there to insure correct behavior.  </s>
<s> I tried to use very general language as to the requirement that base servers take responsibility for what they deliver on the wire.  </s>
<s> It is easy enough to expect the base server to enforce protocol when invoking API programs.  </s>
<s> The new CGI spec. is only intended to be an  </s>
<s> informational RFC.  </s>
<s> Whether or not a server implements the new CGI specification, it must ensure that what it returns as an HTTP/1.1 response is infact a HTTP/1.1 response.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> And the spec does that now - it does not make any special allowance for responses that originate with some other component or gatewayed system - if the response is labelled HTTP/1.1 then the spec makes certain requirements of it.  </s>
<s> What more is needed than that?  </s>
<s> When we say MUST, we don't need to then provide a list of circumstances under which the MUST still applies - unless we allow for exceptions, there are none.  </s>

<s> If Expect continues in the spec then there can be only two reasonable options: 1. Require the client to perform discovery on the resource (by asking for OPTIONS and looking for a particular header, for example) before using Expect with that resource.  </s>
