<s> Hello, On today's AU teleconference there was general agreement to hold our next AU Face-to-Face meeting at the end of the CSUN conference in Los Angeles: In the past, one and a half days has proven to be a reasonable amount of time for these meetings.  </s>
<s> Those on the call agreed that Saturday (22 March 2003) was most convenient for a full day meeting.  </s>
<s> This means we could hold the further half day meeting on either Friday (AM or PM) or on Sunday (AM or PM).  </s>
<s> Please let us know your preference, as soon as possible, for the half day meeting: __ Friday AM __ Friday PM __ Sunday AM __ Sunday PM Cheers, Jan Jan Richards, User Interface Design Specialist Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), University of Toronto Web: http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/jan/richards.html  </s>

<s> I will not be able to attend the CSUN meeting unfortunately, but I will be in Cambridge for the W3C technical plenary all week and hope to see many of you there.  </s>
<s> BTW, NIST could host a face-fo-face meeting of the WAI-AUWG later this year, if the working group members would want.  </s>
<s> If there is consensus interest from the WG, just let me know some dates and I'll see about reserving a room.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Tim Boland NIST  </s>
<s> So as not to conflict with CSUN sessions on Friday, or the WAI IG meeting on Saturday afternoon, we propose that the March 2003 F2F be held on: Sunday (23 March 2003): 8:30 to 16:00 PST At: Los Angeles Airport Marriott (LAX Marriott) in Los Angeles, CA In addition, we would also like to schedule an AUWG working dinner on Saturday evening (22 March 2003).  </s>
<s> If any Participant in Good Standing (http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/members) objects to this meeting, please respond no later than Tuesday, 4 February 2003.  </s>
<s> If no objections arise by that date, an agenda and registration instructions will be sent to the list.  </s>
<s> We would also like to schedule a brief presentation on the work of the AUWG at the WAI-IG meeting, which is scheduled for Saturday (22 March 2003) from 14:30-18:00.  </s>
