<s> The following is the proposal based on everyone's ideas so far and the discussion in the GL call today.  </s>
<s> 1) There is a WCAG Base document which provides the level 1 and Level 2 items (For the time being the three levels are being called Level 1 - Guidelines Level 2 - Checkpoints Level 3 - Checkpoint Solutions  </s>
<s> 2) There are a series of documents which we call Technology Specific Checkpoint Solutions These documents use the Level 1 Guidelines as divisions The level 2 items are checkpoints in the document  </s>
<s> 3) Under each Checkpoint are a series of conditionals that read like - If you use the IMG tag than you must do one of the following  </s>
<s> Under that conditional - you list all of the things that are acceptable checkpoint solutions (which could be a set of things) for that checkpoint and that condition.  </s>
<s> - The second last item in the list is always: "Alternate Equivalent Solution" ...... though if you use an equivalent method you must document it on your website.)  </s>
<s> - The last item is a statement that this element is not used.  </s>
<s> Such  </s>
<s> as "IMG tag is not used" For EACH conditional they MUST then do one of the items or item sets in the list (which includes "EQUIVALENT" and "NOT USED")  </s>
<s> 4) If they are able to check one "checkpoint solution" for each conditional under a checkpoint then they can check off the Checkpoint.  </s>
<s> 5) To be Compliant at any level, you must have checked off all the checkpoints for that level.  </s>
<s> (this only works NOTES: - if there is anything that MUST be part of ANY solution for a checkpoint - then that should appear in each alternative and it should also appear in the Equivalent statement.  </s>

<s> Seems to imply a division along "element" lines rather than "checkpoint" lines?  </s>
<s> So are the "solutions" thusly divided (perhaps each "element" of a "technology" must be under some checkpoint)?  </s>

<s> For things which do not, strictly speaking, fall under any given technology?  </s>
<s> Or are we assuming we will include those on the TSCS?  </s>
<s> Such a document might be worth making anyway, even if it's not released, for internal use -- in other words, something that says to us making TSCS docs, "Here's what you need to include that are solutions, but which can be used with a number of technologies."  </s>

<s> Hynn's point is really important - at the end of the day there are a number of questions like "did you put a picture in your page?  </s>
<s> If so did you do it using the img element, the object element, as a background property, by using pre to construct a diagram using characters, ... If we use the term element it will be understood by people who know the languages (HTML or whatever) to mean a particular language element.  </s>
