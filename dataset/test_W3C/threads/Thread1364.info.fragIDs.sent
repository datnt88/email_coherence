<s> Some days late now but nevertheless I would like to give my 0.02$:  </s>
<s> A label is a human-readable string.  </s>
<s> To correctly display an arbitrary sequence of Unicode characters, a computer must know the language of the string.  </s>
<s> This allows the computer to, for example, draw the characters left to right, or right to left, as appropriate.  </s>
<s> Thus the language tag is necessary.  </s>
<s> The problem that a label can be a four letter word in another language :-) doesn't strike me as very relevant in practice.  </s>
<s> Also the drawing direction of the characters is implicitly encoded in the characters themselves, isn't it ?  </s>
<s> So I think that a label as a simple string of UNICODE characters would be good enough and simple to implement too.  </s>
<s> Not aesthetically perfect, but a working solution if you want to draw people from RCS, CVS, Clearcase to name a few, which heavily rely on labels.  </s>
<s> So I would keep the label header as a simple UNICODE string.  </s>

<s> From what I understand, not necessarily.  </s>
<s> I am not opposed to labels.  </s>
<s> I just believe labels should be tagged with an identifier of the language of the label text.  </s>
<s> This is my best understanding of the intent of the IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages (described in RFC 2277, which is also IETF Best Common Practice (BCP) 18).  </s>
<s> Section 4.2 of RFC 2277 is very explicit: 4.2.  </s>
<s> Requirement for language tagging Protocols that transfer text MUST provide for carrying information about the language of that text.  </s>
<s> Protocols SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the language of names, where appropriate.  </s>
<s> Note that this does NOT mean that such information must always be present; the requirement is that if the sender of information wishes to send information about the language of a text, the protocol provides a well-defined way to carry this information.  </s>
<s> To resolve this issue, DeltaV needs to either: (a) Develop a plausible explanation for why label information is not human readable text.  </s>
<s> (b) Explain why label text, unlike all other human readable text, does not require language tagging.  </s>
<s> (c) Add a language tag to the label.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, choices (a) and (b) are high-risk, since they have a higher probability of causing the DeltaV draft to be sent back to the working group to resolve the i18n issues associated with labels.  </s>
<s> Choice (c) is low-risk, since it meets the letter and spirit of RFC 2277.  </s>
<s> Let me also note that the author of RFC 2277, Harald Alvestrand, is now the Chair of the IETF, which I interpret as indicating that the IETF's commitment to internationalization continues to be quite strong.  </s>

<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> Rather than nuke the header, I propose that we take advantage of the standard format for headers: Label: name; language="en-us" Note that RFC 2616, S3.10 talks about how to specify a language value.  </s>
