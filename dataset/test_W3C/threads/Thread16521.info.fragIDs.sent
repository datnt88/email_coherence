<s> One reason why I would not use the phrase "click here" or similar is that it insinuates the user is able to use a pointing device (mouse or what have you) which is not always true.  </s>

<s> The real problem with "click" is it represents a failure to think about appropriate hypertext...  </s>
<s> I think it is possible to use appropriate hypertext and still use the word "click" in that hypertext.  </s>
<s> Link copy should tell users what to expect when they follow a link.  </s>
<s> Making rules for how we accomplish that misses the point.  </s>
<s> Whether we use "click," "select," "follow," "read," "choose," "slam" or "pound" as the active verb is a literary issue, not a literal one, as long as meaning is clear.  </s>
<s> Terminology is an appropriate part of design.  </s>
<s> Depending on the context and purpose of one site, I may choose to use one hypertext phrase throughout.  </s>
<s> On a different site, I may choose variety.  </s>
<s> That choice and the goal of clarity rightly belong within the creative challenge.  </s>

<s> Click is slang for "follow this link" in the same way that "web surfer" is slang for "user of the world wide web."  </s>
<s> Trying to overcome things that actually cause people to lose access to content is one thing; trying to change slang because we don't think it's "inclusive" enough is another thing altogether.  </s>
<s> Fights should be chosen wisely, and there's no reason to choose a fight over "click here for X " -- the meaning is perfectly unambiguous when used as slang in a non-technical setting.  </s>

<s> [Just as a note about XML trends and the future] The problem with explaining the BACGROUND image is much like the LONGDESC problem.  </s>
<s> Logically, these descrptions are about things that are themselves attributes, whereas the SGML tradition only allows us to add attributes to give information about elements.  </s>
<s> Not to give information about attributes.  </s>
<s> Except via unpopular technologies such as architectural forms.  </s>
<s> A clue as to a possible solution to this dilemma is the way that the title information item in the SVG syntax is no longer an XML attribute but is an XML subelement, even though its function is to give information about its parent element.  </s>
<s> This allows us to support international titles better.  </s>
<s> It lets us incorporate RUBY and other markup in the title that one needs beyond UniCode text to present literate titles in a wide variety of languages.  </s>
<s> It also allows us to then come back and give information about the TITLE by attributes within the TITLE element or by RDF metadata which is then able to point at the TITLE element as what it is talking about.  </s>
<s> So we should be thinking about migrating the background image to a subelement in XHTML 2 as opposed to an attribute so we can associate a description with it just as with any other image.  </s>
