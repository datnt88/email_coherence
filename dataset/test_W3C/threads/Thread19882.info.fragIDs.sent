<s> Hi, I have just got your new browser Amaya V1.3 for Linux.  </s>
<s> It is really nice that now cut &amp; paste is possible in the standard way.  </s>
<s> This makes working much easier.  </s>
<s> But the new realease just ignores the file ~/.amaya.css  </s>
<s> , which is interpreted correctly by the old version 1.2a.  </s>
<s> Without these information the font of the displayed HTML text is nearly unreadable on my screen (I use "magnification : 3;" and "font-family: helvetica;").  </s>
<s> In the help texts there is nothing about a chage in the configuration files.  </s>
<s> Is this a bug?  </s>
<s> Can you tell me when it is planned that Amaya displays the new HTML 4.0 characters (&amp;cong; &amp;sim; &amp;alpha; etc.)?  </s>
<s> This would be very important for many users.  </s>
<s> Many thanks for your help, Jochen M. Braun  </s>

<s> Hi, I realize that I forgot to memtion an important modification in the Amaya release 1.3.  </s>
<s> As you know, previous Amaya releases used the "Maginfication" rule to automatically zoom documents.  </s>
<s> This rule was prososed in earlyest CSS drafts but was never adopted.  </s>
<s> To make Amaya more conform to CSS1, we decided to remove this rule and to use the registry file to control the magnification.  </s>
<s> It's now possible to zoom in and zoom out document window by document window, so each document displayed within a zoomed window will be displayed larger or smaller than its real size according of the current zoom.  </s>
<s> Amaya has a default zoom value equal to 0 (documents are displayed by default as they are).  </s>
<s> This default value can be modified in the registry file of the user by the parameter ZOOM.  </s>
<s> Users who used the CSS rule "Magnification: 3" in previous Amaya releases (before 1.3) have now to set the corresponding parameter value in the registry file: ZOOM=3.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
