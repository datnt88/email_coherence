<s> Hi all, To get the ball rolling again on the features of HTTP/1.1, I'd like to get a firm definition of the packetized transfer encoding.  </s>
<s> The packet CTE will be used to safely delimit the size of dynamically generated response messages and (if the server is known to be 1.1 or above) requests with content.  </s>
<s> The last time I posted my notes regarding the format, I referred to it as being basically the same as that proposed by Dan Connolly way back in 9409271503.AA27488@austin2.hal.com on www-talk.  </s>
<s> I'd like to change that now, before we get products out on the street that use the sucker.  </s>
<s> After investigating the needs of the security/authentication folks regarding the desire to sign the content of a message after it is generated, Phill Hallam-Baker has proposed adding a footer to the format that would contain post-generation Entity-Header fields.  </s>
<s> Also, I've been playing around with various formats and have found that the optimum for most transfers uses a simple one-byte prefix to encode the length of each packet, with a zero byte indicating end-of-packets.  </s>
<s> So, without further ado, here's the format: Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet Entity-Body = *( packet ) NUL footer CRLF NUL = octet 0 packet = packet-size packet-data packet-size = OCTET, excluding octet 0, representing the unsigned integer (1-255) packet-data = packet-size(OCTET) footer = *( Entity-Header ) Note that the footer is terminated by an empty line (just like the headers) and is optional.  </s>
<s> The semantics of a footer are as if the given Entity-Header fields are part of the message headers.  </s>
<s> The un-packetizer algorithm is fairly simple.  </s>
<s> length := 0 packet-size := read-byte while (packet-size  0) do read input until amt-read == packet-size write buffer to BODY length := length + packet-size packet-size := read-byte line := read-line while (line is not empty) do process Entity-Header append header to HEADERS replace Content-Length value with length.  </s>
<s> In other words, the result looks like a normal message, with the Content-Length computed by the unpacketizer.  </s>
<s> In actuality, it is often faster to read packet-size + 1 bytes, slurping in the next packet-size as part of the prior packet read.  </s>
<s> So, is that enough detail for discussion?  </s>
<s> I will try to get the updated 1.0 spec done this week, with the 1.1 spec soon after that.  </s>

<s> (fielding@ics.uci.edu)  </s>
<s> The advantages that the one-byte packet-size has is that it takes up a minimal amount of space in the stream of bits to the transfer and is trivial for any system to produce or consume.  </s>
<s> Allowing larger packets means we have to use decimal (with the additional CRLF delimiters) or hope that everyone remembers to read the number in network byte order.  </s>
<s> I acknowledge a small space improvement (see below).  </s>
<s> I wouldn't rank it as "onorous".  </s>
<s> I think "network byte order" is a red herring -- you would be converting a decimal number to binary.  </s>
<s> That is an "or", as in we could send the number using a binary integer if the integer was restricted to network-byte-order interpretation, but implementations are notorious for screwing that up in spite of the specs.  </s>
<s> Here is a comparison of the two for selected message sizes.  </s>
<s> (Please  </s>
<s> That is a useful comparison for data transfer overhead (thanks), but what we really need is a comparison of processing overhead, taking into account the vagaries of TCP socket reads/writes.  </s>
<s> Keep it coming .... .......Roy  </s>
<s> I very much prefer the design Dan originally posted Content-Transfer-Encoding: packet 15 fifteen bytes where the 1 5 CR LF indicate "read exactly fifteen octets" (the example happening to have a CR and LF at the end of the printable characters), at which point the receiver (either client or server) looks for another ASCII byte count, always terminated by CR/LF.  </s>
<s> I do not see the problem with using ASCII numerals terminated by CR/LF.  </s>
<s> Though I expect quite a few real transfers using such a method to be effectively unreadable, it's likely that the "packets" will often be large enough to hold the entire "file", in which case the transfers will again be humanly readable.  </s>
<s> I expect this latter to happen frequently in a development scenario, and keeping the protocol "eyeballable" to developers only helps.  </s>
<s> Simplify life for the developers and you get a more solid product and get it to market quicker.  </s>
<s> CPU time is less expensive than man hours.  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> I see no justification for not using it.  </s>
<s> I like this idea; just pick another name.  </s>
<s> I hope that Dan's "packet" CTE will see the light of day (even though he may himself have abandonned it by now), and maybe reserving that name will help.  </s>
<s> Maybe call yours "pack8bit"?  </s>
<s> Another variation might be to call all of them "packet", and require a parameter for the prefix: 8bit, 16bit, or ASCII.  </s>
<s> That's an optimization that works on some systems; not on others.  </s>
<s> Keep the protocol free from platform specifics.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the contribution!  </s>

<s> That's an optimization that works on some systems; not on others.  </s>
<s> Keep the protocol free from platform specifics.  </s>
<s> Although I strongly favor the use of ASCII encodings of "packet" lengths (perhaps we could use a term besides "packet", which will cause untold confusion for years to come), I agree that it might be nice to use an encoding that occupies a fixed number of bytes.  </s>
<s> It's not exactly "platform-specific" to optimize things in this way; it's basically a tradeoff between these two algorithms: [*** Anti-paranoia warning: I'm writing these examples using UNIX *** APIs for concreteness, NOT because this is the the only API *** I care about.  </s>
<s> So don't flame me about that, please.]  </s>
<s> Naive algorithm: while (not done) fgets(length, sizeof(length), stream); n = decode(length); fread(buffer, n, 1, stream); end Clever algorithm: fgets(length, sizeof(length), stream); n = decode(length) while (not done) fread(buffer, n+sizeof(length), 1, stream); n = decode(&amp;buffer[n]); end The clever algorithm uses M+1 instead of 2*M reads from the input stream.  </s>
<s> This is especially important if your code doesn't want to read past the end of the input stream (cf. the NCSA httpd server), in which case you would write this using read() system calls instead of using stdio buffering.  </s>
<s> Note also that if we use a simple ASCII encoding, you need to parse the input stream to figure out where the end of the "packet" length string is.  </s>
<s> If we use an encoding that takes a fixed number of columns, then you don't need to parse anything, you just grab a bunch of bytes.  </s>
<s> Since I also don't see any reason to limit the "packet" size to just 256 bytes, or to any small value, I recommend that the length field be fairly large.  </s>
<s> For example, suppose that the standard says "use 6 digits + CR + LF".  </s>
<s> Then this leaves the following data nicely aligned (even for 64-bit machines), and allows almost a million bytes per "packet".  </s>
<s> Better yet, use a hexadecimal encoding; this allows  16 million bytes, and is much easier to encode and decode.  </s>
<s> Example: 0 0 0 0 0 8 CR LF eight bytes of data 1 0 0 0 0 0 CR LF 1,048,576 bytes of data 0 0 0 0 0 0 CR LF -Jeff  </s>
<s> We could call it "chunky" if you like...  </s>
<s> I prefer that over "chunks", though I'm sure we could have no end of amusement talking about blowing chunks across the network.  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> Good point -- I prefer that as well (in fact, knowing the size of the size ahead of time was one of the main reasons to do a 256chunk).  </s>
<s> Hmmm, fixed hex sounds reasonable, but 6 digits is a bit overboard.  </s>
<s> And why would we need the CRLF if the size is fixed?  </s>
<s> It does not improve readability (aside from the first chunk).  </s>
<s> How about four hex bytes: 0 0 0 8 eight bytes of data F F F F 65,535 bytes of data 0 0 0 0 CR LF CR LF I would still prefer to see some hard data on the performance differences.  </s>
<s> Unlike the rest of HTTP/1.1, this has to be right the first time its distributed in beta code.  </s>

<s> No, there will be only one packetized 8bit-clean CTE that will be required for HTTP/1.1 compliance.  </s>
<s> That is why we are having this discussion now, instead of after a full draft is produced.  </s>
<s> Folks, I am getting a little tired of this line of response without any thought behind it.  </s>
<s> There is absolutely nothing  </s>
<s> platform-specific about preferring 1 read over two reads.  </s>
<s> If you have a technical disagreement, fine, but the next person who cries "platform specific" better damn well include at least one concrete example wherein the protocol prefers one platform over another, and not just because of differring TCP implementation bugs.  </s>

<s> (fielding@ics.uci.edu)  </s>
<s> I became a convert to the 'boundary' method for delimiting otherwise unbounded data, as is done with multipart/* messages.  </s>
<s> E.g., content-transfer-encoding: bounded-binary; boundary="xxxxxx" would signal that the actual data started with --xxxxxx and ended with --xxxxxx-- This is simple for both the sender and recipient; the packetized encodings seem messy.  </s>
<s> I'd worry that we'd need an 'accept-transfer-encoding' to allow negotiation of CTE, though.  </s>
<s> Hmmm, fixed hex sounds reasonable, but 6 digits is a bit overboard.  </s>
<s> Well, I was assuming that 4-byte or 8-byte alignment is a Good Thing for fast processing, and that we would use CRLF.  </s>
<s> With 2 bytes taken up by CRLF, that leaves either 2 hex digits or 6 hex digits.  </s>
<s> To quote Gordon Bell and Bill Strecker, "There is only one mistake that can be made in computer design that is difficult to recover from -- not having enough address bits for memory addressing and memory management."[1]  </s>
<s> That seems to apply to network protocols, too: look at the problems with TCP sequence number space and window size, and with NFS request size and file offset size.  </s>
<s> 4 hex digits *might* be enough, but since (as you've observed several times) we won't have a chance to fix this once it is widely implemented, I'd vote for 6 or 8 hex digits, just to be safe.  </s>
<s> And why would we need the CRLF if the size is fixed?  </s>
<s> It does not improve readability (aside from the first chunk).  </s>
<s> I suppose that's open to interpretation.  </s>
<s> Anyway, if you buy the argument that 6 hex digits are worth having, and you buy the argument that the fields should 4-byte aligned, then the CRLF doesn't really cost anything.  </s>

<s> In fact, the "--xxxxxx--" does not necessarily end the multipart body, it is just the end of the interesting stuff.  </s>
<s> Without additional contraints on accuracy, multipart is worthless as a size delimiter.  </s>
<s> In addition, it requires the receiver to scan the entire message body for the delimiter, which has proven to be contrary to the design goals of HTTP.  </s>

<s> 4 things: 1) I do try to put some thought behind a response before pressing the SEND key.  </s>
<s> It is unfortunate that I *consistently* remember/realize/recognize more pieces *after* pressing SEND for which I find I have to follow-up.  </s>
<s> Thus, I remembered my real objection after pressing SEND, *and* realized that I really LIKE your proposal.  </s>
<s> 2) it is immensely convenient that MIME is "plain text".  </s>
<s> It is unfortunate (but perhaps correctable) that this characteristic is not documented, supported, and exploited.  </s>
<s> CTE packet (as you've proposed) would encourage yet more MIME streams that are valid MIME and yet NOT "plain text".  </s>
<s> Although I like your proposed mechanism for CTE packet, I do NOT like the idea of more non-plaintext cluttering up MIME.  </s>
<s> Would that the trend would reverse itself.  </s>
<s> If someone could propose a "packet" content transfer encoding that fit well with a "MIME should be plain text" objective, I'd very much like to see it.  </s>
<s> Since I cannot think of one (Dan's was good), I'll accept yours if the rest of the world does, but I will ask for some additional wording.  </s>
<s> (see below)  </s>
<s> 3) There's nothing broken in the TCP stack I'm using.  </s>
<s> But I'm not reading directly from TCP.  </s>
<s> The TCP stream is being fed to another stage, another process, in the pipeline of my HTTPD.  </s>
<s> In this context, I simply don't have a read(,,size) construct available.  </s>
<s> To that extent, "reading one byte beyond" is a platform-specific optimization.  </s>
<s> THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOUR PROPOSAL A SHOW STOPPER, it just means that I won't be able to do it as efficiently as others.  </s>
<s> The *optimization* you recommend is what's platform specific, not the CTE itself.  </s>
<s> Really, this has nothing directly to do with the platform (VM) but with the VHLL (REXX) and its supporting tools (CMS Pipelines).  </s>
<s> I'm getting a lot of efficiency where I can hand-off the byte counting to system level routines.  </s>
<s> If the whole thing is plain text, that makes my work a complete cake walk.  </s>
<s> Where things are binary, I can still get it done, it's just not as elegant.  </s>
<s> 4) I suggest (for the sake of argument) that we recommend CTE packet explicitly for on-the-wire transfer and INCLUDE WORDING that as it is taken off-the-wire the CTE packet should be immediately processed and removed.  </s>
<s> Other than that, this is a good idea.  </s>
<s> I regret that I didn't recognize my pleasure in it at first, but I think I've outlined the reasons why it struck me wrong initially.  </s>
<s> Using just one byte clearly avoids the network byte order problem.  </s>
<s> Using a "zero means end" signal works just fine.  </s>
<s> Excellent proposal, Roy.  </s>
<s> So in summary: I'd like to keep off-the-wire MIME in "plain text" (ie: with local canonicalizations and all printable characters) form whenever possible.  </s>
<s> I'm willing to accept on-the-wire MIME in "binary" forms if we can be clear about the difference, can explain the canonicalization issue, and can encourage the use of the plain text forms where feasible.  </s>
