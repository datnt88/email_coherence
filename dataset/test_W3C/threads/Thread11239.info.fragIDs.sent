<s> Sean Mc Grath points out that the namespace problem recurrs in many modern programming languages, and that these may give clues to a solution.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> I was very conscious of the IMPORT mechanism in Modula-2 when I proposed a solution to namespaces.  </s>
<s> (You are also correct that this is not a solution for sub-classing, an entirely different topic.)  </s>
<s> Briefly, I and several other people looked at several possible ways to create qualified names.  </s>
<s> Qualified names were an obvious requirement, since having multiple namespaces obtain within a single element was strongly demanded by several important user communities.  </s>
<s> It was equally obvious that the web already has a mechanism for creating unique names, specifically URIs.  </s>
<s> *Syntax issues aside* (emphatically), here were the three front-runner candidates: 1The URI-at-the-front method: Every element name is qualified by putting the URI of its namespace at the beginning, separated by something.  </s>
<s> For example, http://purl.org/schemas#AUTHOR  </s>
<s> William Shakespeare /http://purl.org/schemas#AUTHOR .  </s>
<s> This has obvious problems.  </s>
<s> Many of the URI characters are not legal XML naming characters.  </s>
<s> Fragment identifiers have unreliable semantics.  </s>
<s> Etc.  </s>
<s> 2.The "Java" method: Use a form of indirection, in which a namespace is known throughout the document by an identifier that is a legal XML name, but that name is somehow associated with the controlling URI.  </s>
<s> In the "Java" method, the XML-legal identifier is inside the DTD (or other document defining the namespace).  </s>
<s> IMPORT http://www.purl.org/schemas  </s>
<s> /IMPORT !--  </s>
<s> Somehow associates "xyzzy" with this namespace.  </s>
<s> -- This is essentially number one, but without the illegal character problem.  </s>
<s> However, it now requires that the defining document be modified to contain the namespace name ("xyzzy").  </s>
<s> Worse, it requires that the document be machine-readable in a predefined format, and many important schemata, such as Dublin Core, are not machine readable and will not be for years.  </s>
<s> That is, it mixes the problem of identifying  </s>
<s> namespaces with the problem of their defining document's format.  </s>
<s> ("Author" in the example above actually comes from the Dublin Core, a text document.)  </s>
<s> Finally, it doesn't really solve the namespace problem, it just moves it up a level.  </s>
<s> We still have to somehow manage that no two namespaces ever use the same name (e.g. "xyzzy").  </s>
<s> 3.The "Modula-2" method: Use a form of indirection, in which a namespace is known throughout the document by an identifier that is a legal XML name, but that name is somehow associated with the controlling URI.  </s>
<s> In the "Modula-2" method, the XML-legal identifier is inside the referencing document.  </s>
<s> This simply references a namespace, without any requirements of the format (even existence!) of the defining document.  </s>
<s> The user of the namespace is responsible for picking a local name, subject only to the requirement that it is unique within the scope of his local use.  </s>
<s> --Andrew Layman AndrewL@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> The problem with all these methods is scope.  </s>
<s> XML is concerned with documents that are longer than those on the WWW today.  </s>
<s> XML needs to be able to deal with compound documents, where different fragments have been taken from different sources, created with different DTDs.  </s>
<s> In reusing fragments we don't want to have to change the tagging.  </s>
<s> Therefore what is needed is a way of saying that from this element till you  </s>
<s> find the matching end-tag, consider that a separate name space has been set  </s>
<s> up whereby all tags within this scope can be considered to have automagically been qualified by a specified name space qualifier.  </s>
<s> The fact that this name space qualifier has the effect of ABC:DEF is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> What is important is that users don't have to remember that they need to qualfify DEF by ABC and can continue to call DEF by the name they have been used to using when creating DEFs in their normal source documents.  </s>
<s> What my proposal sought to do was to provide a scopable statement of how far name spaces applied, while still giving a mechanism for referencing from one scope to another with ID references.  </s>
<s> This feature seems to be ignored by  </s>
<s> most other proposals.  </s>
<s> One question they must all ask themselves is " how can I be sure that an ID in a reused fragment conforming to DTD X will not conflict with an ID in a DTD for fragment Y".  </s>
<s> I would be very grateful to hear how this can be acheived wth any of the three proposals made by Andrew Layman.. Martin Bryan, The SGML Centre, Churchdown, Glos.  </s>
<s> GL3 2PU, UK  </s>
<s> This would seem to make things much harder for the Perl Hacker.  </s>
<s> At this point I think that there should be a single default scope and everything else should be explicitly "called in" from another scope.  </s>
<s> I believe that SGML architectures allow this.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> This is a good point, but it's not a fatal flaw of the proposals, just a good feature to add to them.  </s>
<s> I'm rather dubious about the namespace issue  </s>
<s> (as I intend to say later on), but I don't think that scoping is a problem for any of the proposals other than the high colonic -- and that proposal simply avoids the problem by requiring full qualification.  </s>
<s> FWIW dynamic scope is definitely useful in some cases, and we should make sure not to forget to examine techniques and implications of it for anything we decide.  </s>

<s> Thank you for bringing up again the important issue of scope.  </s>
<s> I did not address it in my mail discussing how namespaces are named (the "Java  </s>
<s> method" versus the "Modula-2 method") but that was only because I wanted to separate the problem into parts.  </s>
<s> I completely agree that it is important.  </s>
<s> In my "Namespaces Version 2" mail last night, I suggest a method that is similar in some respects to what you propose.  </s>
<s> Each element can contain within it a list of the namespaces that are used within that element.  </s>
<s> If that element and its contents are moved, or used as a document fragment, all those namespaces remain listed and active.  </s>
<s> (Full details in my proposal).  </s>
<s> --Andrew Layman AndrewL@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> Good point about the hacker.  </s>
<s> We need a simple style guide for when something is and is not qualified.  </s>
<s> However, this rule could be friendlier than Paul suggests.  </s>
<s> I could be: If your namespace is the same as your containing element's do not use qualification.  </s>
<s> If it is different, you must use qualification.  </s>
<s> By the way, given the existence of entities, and the proposals to use architectures, how do PERL hackers ever actually get reliable results?  </s>
