<s> lisa  </s>
<s> The term "version URL" simply means a URL that identifies a version.  </s>
<s> In your example I'm not sure what you mean by "relative URL".  </s>
<s> Servers may support deleting individual versions (as well as the entire versioned resource).  </s>
<s> It would be undesirable for servers to reuse version URLs since they represent a 'stable' reference to a particular state of the resource, and may be used as such by other persistent resources.  </s>
<s> Clearly if the server reuses a URL that would be a bad thing in such circumstances.  </s>
