<s> The exchange of information between user agents must keep pace with changes in the content.  </s>
<s> It may be necessary to allow the user to configure the user agent to pause before changes to content or the user interface so that an assistive technology has time to react.  </s>
<s> JRG: Unless we have an example of how this would work I would like to see it removed.  </s>
<s> We can add it to a future issues list for the document or forwarded to the PF group, but I know off no technical way for AT and UA to do this or how it would help assistive technology.  </s>
<s> This has been a consistently difficult checkpoint for developers to understand and I think this type of techniques suggestion will only add to the confusion on what should be a simple checkpoint to understand.  </s>
<s> 2. Please refer to the appendix that explains how to load assistive technologies for DOM access.  </s>
<s> JRG: I would like to see this bullet changed to: "Loading assistive technologies into the same address space as the address space used by the UA reduces the time it takes for AT requests to the UA to be processed.  </s>
<s> Examples of how to do this with diiferent operating systems can be found in an appendix to this document.  </s>
<s> This is especailly important for access to the DOM"  </s>
<s> Additional Bullet: Use operating system conventions for programmatic interfaces that require the least amount of operating system overhead for the exchange of information between assistive technologies and user agents.  </s>
<s> The two ares of concern are for timeliness of access to the DOM and timeliness of access to user interface controls by assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> In the case of user interface controls using standard system controls will typically support timely access.  </s>

<s> Response is JRG2:  </s>
<s> JRG2: If a technique needs work at this point in the development of the techniques document I think it should be given to interested working group members as an action item for them to develop.  </s>
<s> When the validity of the technique for accessibility is clearer to the working group it can then be added to the techniques document.  </s>
<s> Until that time I think putting in questionable techniques will cause unnecessary problems during the review process.  </s>
<s> This would be the only technique I am aware of as marked as "needs work" if included.  </s>

<s> IJ2: Up to now, techniques have not undergone explicit WG review before being included in the techniques document.  </s>
<s> I don't disagree with a policy where the WG would approve techniques before they are added, but we don't have such a policy today.  </s>
<s> I marked it as "needs work" not because it's any less ripe than other techniques, but because the ideas themselves are in discussion and I wanted to mark for myself that we needed to continue to develop these ideas.  </s>
