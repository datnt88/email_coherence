<s> Hi! First of all, thank you, Mr. Ragget, for such a wonderful software.. tidy is rather .. huh ... neat!  </s>
<s> :) Second, the enhancement request (it should be a chinch) -  </s>
<s> I'd like to have 2 new command line options: --links and --images.  </s>
<s> I think  </s>
<s> it's obvious, --links would print a (unformated ?) list of all the href URLs  </s>
<s> for the a... tag, --images all the src URLs of img... tags.  </s>
<s> These two options would make tidy very usable in scripts.  </s>
<s> When I get those, I'll tell you about the other enhancement request that I have in store :) Hypertextualy yours, Armando  </s>
<s> Use a perl script instead of html tidy.  </s>
<s> Tidy is ment to be a pretty-printer for HTML Code, not a all-in-one HTML authoring tool.  </s>
<s> Look at HTML::LinkExtor from CPAN; it can do exactly what you want.  </s>
<s> regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann - mailto:bjoern@hoehrmann.de - http://www.bjoernsworld.de  </s>
<s> Hi! I'm affraid that I don't agree with your concept of restricting tidy to be a "pretty-printer for HTML Code".... after all, there are 3133 lines in parser.c  </s>
<s> vs 1594 in pprint.c.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I think of tidy in a wider sense, and the -slides option proves my point :).  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I haven't got the time to hack the (estimated) 20 lines of code that would have to be added to tidy to do the stuff I proposed.  </s>
<s> It's not the 20 lines, its understanding the whole of the code, of course.  </s>
<s> Re LinkExtor, I'll look into it (thanks for the tip), but the fact is that there are dozens of extractors, in Perl, Python, C, even Lisp.  </s>
<s> But on the other hand, tidy is (on my system, at least) all of 103 kb... which is better that loading perl's 491 k, plus (assuming) libwww and the rest.  </s>
<s> The point is that tidy tracks bleeding edge HTML, is based on a grammar, and its fast.  </s>
<s> Again, thank you for the tip Armando  </s>
<s> think  </s>
<s> URLs  </s>
<s> I will look into adding support to Tidy to just list the URLs for anchors or images.  </s>
<s> One idea would be to extend the markup option to accept "images" or "links".  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I have a trip to XML'99 and some chapters in a book to write.  </s>
<s> This means I won't be able to turn this around quickly.  </s>
