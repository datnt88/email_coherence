<s> And now to the main .... part 2:  </s>
<s> First, assay individual differences.  </s>
<s> Find out which ones correlate with performance on the chosen task.  </s>
<s> Many plausible factors may  </s>
<s> be irrelevant.  </s>
<s> Egan and Gomez found that only age and spatial memory mattered for the text editors they studied; education, typing speed, verbal aptitude, job experience, associative memory, and logical reasoning had no effect on performance.  </s>
<s> Second, isolate task components.  </s>
<s> Do a task analysis and determine which components individual differences affect.  </s>
<s> This is admittedly an art.  </s>
<s> Egan and Gomez verified their analysis by creating new tasks with the same components and obtaining the same pattern of correlations, but this additional test is impractical for design teams.  </s>
<s> Third, accommodate the differences by redesigning the interface to minimize performance differences.  </s>
<s> Measure user performance again.  </s>
<s> Egan and Gomez compared a line editor to a newer display editor.  </s>
<s> The newer design simplified command syntax, reducing age differences in performance, but the changes related to spatial memory ability were mixed (and cancelled each other out).  </s>
<s> a.. Distinct groups of people with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> b.. Real-world tasks or functions with which these various user groups have difficulty.  </s>
<s> c.. Underlying cognitive factors creating those difficulties.  </s>
<s> d.. Specific design changes that compensate for the cognitive deficits and improve task performance.  </s>
<s> The EITAAC report (1999) is notable for two things.  </s>
<s> First, it contains some technology-specific standards and implementation details.  </s>
<s> Second, it sets an accessibility goal.  </s>
<s> A person with a disability should be able to "perform the same tasks, access the same information, with the same approximate ease and in the same approximate time and at the same cost" as someone without a disability some of the strategies are a matter of degree.  </s>
<s> Without some form of user testing or human performance modeling, a designer would not know to what extent people with cognitive disabilities actually benefit from overly generalized suggestions such as: "use simple screen layouts," "keep language as simple as possible," "reduce the number of choices."  </s>
<s> Re-use familiar, well-learned organizational schemes.  </s>
<s> In fact, a designer might use several strategies, even measurable ones, yet miss the combination that makes the product accessible to people with particular cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> Verifying accessibility depends on knowing the characteristics of distinct user groups, and assessing their performance with the complete product.  </s>
