<s> There's an issue with namespace normalisation in the reference algo (B.1) in PR which I hadn't noticed until DOM-TS started testing for it: if ( Element's localName is null ) // DOM Level 1 node Otherwise, report an error I believe this behaviour to be undesirable.  </s>
<s> It would mean you'd be unable to serialise any document containing Level 1 Elements (or Attrs) without deliberately setting the DOMConfiguration parameter 'namespaces' to false.  </s>
<s> Previously Core has only warned that "mixing both sets of methods can lead to unpredictable results"; this is the first time it has been made an actual error.  </s>
<s> Though there are indeed cases where mixing levels causes problems, there are also common trivial cases which are unambiguous.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, raising a warning may be appropriate, but making it an error (so that by default processing stops altogether) seems excessively harsh and likely to bite application authors a lot.  </s>
<s> There are still times where it is useful for a function to, for example, add an unprefixed attribute to an element without caring whether the element is a Level 1 or 2 node.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure namespace normalisation should be touching Level 1 nodes at all; perhaps it would make sense to raise an error only for clearly namespace-ill-formed names (eg.  </s>
<s> 'blob::').  </s>
<s> Don't know if such a change is even possible at this late stage, but I thought I should bring it up.  </s>
<s> Oh, and on a completely unrelated issue, the resolution to issue CR-andrew2 should be applied to setIdAttributeNode as well as setIdAttribute and setIdAttributeNS.  </s>
<s> And finally a typo in UserDataHandler.handle: "DOM applications must not raised exceptions..."  </s>
<s> These are the only problems I've been able to find so far.  </s>
<s> Looking forward to Rec! Andrew Clover  </s>
<s> I added this in our issues list:  </s>
<s> Fixed. Philippe, typo maker since the 1980s.  </s>
<s> I'd also suggest that a non-namespace aware parse would result in a document where setParameter("namespaces") returns false.  </s>
<s> If you don't do something like this then any existing code that did a non-namespace aware parse would silently fail on any attempt of normalization.  </s>
<s> I mocked up a test that checks that the value of the namespaces parameter follows the parser settings and currently it doesn't for Xerces-J.  </s>
<s> This is correct.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 1 applications need to be careful about this before invoking a load, parse, or normalizeDocument methods.  </s>
<s> We still believe that it is dangerous to mix non-namespaces and namespaces aware nodes in the same tree.  </s>
<s> This reflects a design problem in the DOM application.  </s>
<s> The default processing may not cause the processing to stop if the error can be recovered (cf [1]).  </s>
<s> Continuing the processing if the mistake cannot be recovered would be harmful if the document is being serialized for example.  </s>
<s> As mentioned in the section regarding XML Namespaces (1.3.3), this behavior should be avoided.  </s>
<s> If the processor believes that the error can be recovered, it is free to continue the processing.  </s>
