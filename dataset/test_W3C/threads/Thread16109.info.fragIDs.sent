<s> Bobby doesn't know anything about what is in the image; it has to give you that warning because this is something it can't tell.  </s>
<s> The rules for ALT don't change when LONGDESC is present.  </s>
<s> ALT should still be written to make sure that the job of the image in telling the story of the page is fulfilled.  </s>
<s> For an example see http://trace.wisc.edu/world/paci/ .  </s>
<s> Here the long description is referenced by a d-link and not the longdesc attribute, but the implications for ALT text writing are the same.  </s>
<s> I expect others on the list have better examples but it's a holiday weekend... Al  </s>
<s> My personal approach (rant) to the question "When to use style sheets?":  </s>
<s> Whenever you want to determine a preferred presentation for your web content.  </s>
<s> (In most commercial cases this means always).  </s>
<s> Use transitional HTML to add some of the features that style sheets can provide, but do not accept the idea that the graphic design is so important that the utility of the content can be sacrificed to it, or that breaking the future to maintain the failures of the past is a good process.  </s>
<s> The long version: The fact that you are designing for the lowest common denominated browser to work means you need a strategy that transforms gracefully.  </s>
<s> Style sheets provide just such a strategy.  </s>
<s> If you want to provide greater control over presentation in old technologies, there are two alternatives: 1. Design specifically for those old technologies, tothe exclusion of new technology.  </s>
<s> This is similar to the strategy that brought you the Y2K bug, countless cases of incompatibility increasing cost and decreasing productivity, and retards widespread adoption of more appropriate and better designed technology.  </s>
<s> 2. Design for the future, and then add whatever features can be safely incorporated for people who remain bound to the past.  </s>
<s> In the specific case of HTML, there are some hard choices.  </s>
<s> Stylesheets provide a high degree of control over virtually all presentation, including aural (sound) styles, positioning, etc.  </s>
<s> Some of these features (most notably font styles and colours) can be happily provided by HTML 4.0 transitional (and even by XHTML transtional) in a way which allows a few specific browsers (Netscape 2 and 3, Explorer 2, Opera 2 I think) which did not implement CSS, to be catered for in the same way as more modern browsers.  </s>
<s> In addition, there are some features in CSS such as control of layout, which can be replicated by the use of TABLE in HTML.  </s>
<s> *** This is a bad idea *** (Charles' personal opinion) Using TABLE to control presentation is not easily compatible with CSS layout control.  </s>
<s> It violates the semantics of a web page, and it is common that from that decision comes, consciously or otherwise, an acceptance of web content where the critical semantics are regarded as completely irrelevant.  </s>
<s> Most users of the web will not thank you for this.  </s>
<s> Most of the users who might think it is a fine thing won't know if you have done it or not, but for all the rest it will be clear, and it will be a problem that you caused by making a decision (or allowing it to be made for you).  </s>
<s> Using font markup (EM, B, I, FONT, etc) to denote semantic structure such as headings is a mistake.  </s>
<s> Although itwill always be possible, and is more compatible with CSS than table-based layout, this is only by a small amount.  </s>
<s> It does destroy one of the great strengths of CSS which also happens to be a feature in most good browsers: the ability for the user to easily reconfigure presentation of web content to suit their particular needs.  </s>
<s> So do use CSS, if for no other reason than to learn the rules of the future (remember all those people who said I don't need to learn computers - I'll only be working another 20 years?  </s>
<s> Many of those who said it in the 80's worked even less than 20 years), but mostly because it is a good way to achieve a common goal.  </s>
<s> Many browsers, after all, do support CSS - it is hardly new technology.  </s>
<s> Use transitional markup to extend the presentation control that is a common goal.  </s>
<s> But do not use it in place of, or contrary to, the underlying semantics of HTML (or any other markup language).  </s>
