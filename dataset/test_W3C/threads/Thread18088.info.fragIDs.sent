<s> The definition of profile there is: quote A "profile" is a named and persistent representation of user preferences that may be used to configure a user agent.  </s>
<s> Preferences include input configurations, style preferences, etc.  </s>
<s> On systems with distinct user accounts, profiles enable users to reconfigure software quickly when they  </s>
<s> log on.  </s>
<s> Profiles may be shared with other users.  </s>
<s> Platform-independent profiles are useful for those who use the same user agent on different platforms.  </s>
<s> /quote Different UA may have different, possibly incompatible sets of preferences, and may respond differently to some preferences.  </s>
<s> The quote suggests that profile is open-ended.  </s>
<s> For a user to understand all that can go into a profile, a means should be provided to allow full specification, to avoid surprises of an author-supplied change to a default UA behavior, possibly augmented by some user-supplied profile values.  </s>
<s> If the user provides a full specification, such surprise can be avoided.  </s>
<s> But for a user to provide a full stylesheet is an unlikely and burdensome requirement.  </s>
<s> For example how does one provide style differentiation for the presentation of recursively defined element contexts.  </s>
<s> Different combinations of browsers and AT may require different sets of preferences.  </s>
<s> Where is the set of controls that may be defined for platform-independent profiles?  </s>
<s> They may apply for a particular closed application: strict HTML 4.0 rendered on a particular user agent that runs on more than one OS.  </s>
<s> The mapping of (presumed same-function, same-side-effect) control across OS is chancy.  </s>
<s> Consistency is unlikely across UA on the same OS.  </s>
<s> Interaction of AT with different UA on the same OS is also chancy.  </s>
<s> We haven't been so presumptuous to try to standardize these.  </s>
<s> Anarchy is likely to win.  </s>

<s> Harv, The deffinition then would seem to lead towards a strengthening of the minority position on access key.  </s>
