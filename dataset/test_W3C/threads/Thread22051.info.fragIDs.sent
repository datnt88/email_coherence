<s> Several XPath tests (for example, XPathExpression_evaluate_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR) used the string literal "dummy" as a namespace resolver.  </s>
<s> I believe all of these tests expected an exception for other reasons and the type mismatch would have satisified the expectation of an exception.  </s>
<s> If Mozilla actually takes a string literal as an namespace resolver, we should add a test that asserts that an implementation specific exception be thrown.  </s>
<s> Most if not all load statements were missing willBeModified attributes.  </s>
<s> The DTD can't distinguish between the inner class load method definition element and the framework load statement element, so willBeModified is optional in the DTD.  </s>
<s> However, it is required for the framework load statement element in the schema.  </s>
<s> Conformance_Expressions used a lot of append statements to add items to a list of statements.  </s>
<s> These were change per the previous message.  </s>
<s> The reason Mozilla doesn't throw an exception when a string is passed as a namespace resolver is that the argument is still not used, so the string goes through the JS-to-C++ layer and gets converted to the appropriate type, but since it's not used, no exception is ever thrown.  </s>
<s> This is of course not the intent in Mozilla, and the fact that we don't throw an exception is just a shortcoming in Mozilla's current support for DOM XPath.  </s>
