<s> Current Mozilla nightly build will currently fail every DOM 2 HTML test as written do to a issue with getElementsByTag name.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I'm on the road and do not have ready access to all the pertinent documents, so any statements about what the specs say are my best recollection.  </s>
<s> The tests are written to work with both XHTML and HTML, so they follow the recommended pratices in the XHTML 1.0 recommendation of using lower cased tag named in getElementsByTagName.  </s>
<s> The source HTML documents use all upper-case tag names  </s>
<s> (the XHTML documents are valid XHTML so they use upper  </s>
<s> case tag names).  </s>
<s> I believe the spec implies that HTML implementations of getElementsByTagName should return a list of elements that have the same tag name or differ only in case.  </s>
<s> Microsoft IE does do this, so if I ask for getElementsByTagName("a"), I'll also get any A elements in the document.  </s>
<s> Mozilla 0.9.8 will not.  </s>
<s> Since every NIST test starts by finding a specific element using getElementsByTagName() and every HTML tag is in upper case, every case will fail by not finding the element that it wanted to test.  </s>
<s> I believe that the tests are testing legitimate specified behavior, however failing every test because of this one flaw overstates the issue.  </s>
<s> It would be good to confirm that the DOM spec does require case-insensitive behavior from getElementsByTagName and whether the issue can be fixed in Mozilla in a timely manner.  </s>
<s> If not, then it would be best to modify the HTML test documents to use lower case tag names and to introduce specific tests that test getElementsByTagNames() case-insensitivity.  </s>

<s> Shouldn't that be lower case?  </s>
<s> Mozilla is correct (for XHTML) since 'a' and 'A' is not the same element; 'xhtml:A' does not exist.  </s>

<s> Before reading the above, I was naive enough to think that a doctype declaration would be enough to define DOM behaviour....  </s>
<s> If I understand correctly you are talking about HTML, not XHTML.  </s>
<s> So I guess [1] is correct in this case.  </s>

<s> You forgot: For DOM Level 1 [HTML], the transitional and frameset DTDs for HTML 4.0 are assumed.  </s>
<s> XHTML cannot me manipulated with the DOM Level 1 HTML.  </s>
<s> Have a look at DOM Level 2 HTML in order to manipulate XHTML 1.0 documents.  </s>
<s> Mozilla behaves correctly.  </s>
<s> will tell you if, depending on the mime type, the browser loads the DOM tree correctly.  </s>
<s> HTML is a special since it is not XML, so the rules differ.  </s>
<s> If you manipulate an HTML or an XHTML document using the DOM Level 2 HTML, the rules will be different.  </s>
<s> Yes, for HTML 4.0 documents.  </s>

<s> That was a typo, tag names in XHTML are lower case.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer and Mozilla are both correctly case sensitive for XML (and XHTML).  </s>
<s> Their behavior differs for HTML documents.  </s>
<s> IE appears either to perform a case-insensitive match on the tag name, Mozilla performs a case-sensitive match.  </s>
<s> The statements on case sensitivity on HTML implementations in various documents appear to be inconsistant: Section 1.3 of the HTML DOM L2 Working Draft says that: The other thing is that when calling methods that are case insensitive when used on a HTML document (such as getElementsByTagName() and namedItem()) the string that is passed in should be lower case to work on both HTML and XHTML documents.  </s>
<s> Section 1.1.7 of the DOM L2 Core states that string comparisions are strictly binary and hence case-sensitive.  </s>
<s> Section C.11 of the XHTML 1.0 says that the HTML DOM that tagnames and attributes are returned uppercase.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer appears to conform to the behavior alluded to in Section 1.3 of the HTML DOM 2 WD. Mozilla appears to be conforming to the behavior implied by the other two sections.  </s>
