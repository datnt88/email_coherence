<s> l (rdf:parseType="Literal" content) is mapped to an [1]XML literal in the RDF graph.  </s>
<s> This mapping from the XML information items in l to the XML literal Unicode string x is done as follows, or by any method that gives the same result: * Use l to construct an XPath[XPATH] [2]node-set (a [3]document subset) * Apply [4]Exclusive XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]) with comments and with empty [5]InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList to this node-set to give a sequence of octets s * This sequence of octets s can be considered to be a UTF-8 encoding of some Unicode string x (sequence of Unicode characteres) * The Unicode string x is used as the lexical form of l Then o := typed-literal(literal-value := x, literal-datatype := following statement is added to the graph: e.parent.subject.string-value  </s>
