<s> In one camp, that has been quite quiet of late, we have those who argue that inline literals should be self denoting.  </s>
<s> In another, there are those, (some of whom believe the argument has been won), who argue that inline literals denote something else, which might be made clear elsewhere.  </s>
<s> Then there also a few voices, myself and Graham, at the last telecon, arguing for minimalism.  </s>
<s> We have seen the tidiness vs untidiness debate as one without a middle ground.  </s>
<s> The point of this message is to propose it.  </s>
<s> (or rather to remind the group of its existence).  </s>
<s> Middle ground:  </s>
<s> From datatyping part 1:  </s>
<s> Explicit data values in the graph are self denoting.  </s>
<s> From Valentines day MT (VMT)  </s>
<s> Other literals are syntactically untidy.  </s>
<s> Literal semantics depends on a function XL mapping lteral nodes to literal values.  </s>
<s> Nothing is said about whether XL induces a function or not on the literal labels.  </s>
<s> i.e. this does not rule out tidy semantics.  </s>
<s> Moreover, consider the crucial tidiness entailments.  </s>
<s> a foo "literal" .  </s>
<s> b bar "literal".  </s>
<s> this does not entail a foo _:b .  </s>
<s> b bar _:b .  </s>
<s> (in the VMT)  </s>
<s> However, this is not because of untidy semantics, but merely because the first triple by itself is not entailed.  </s>
<s> i.e. a foo "literal" .  </s>
<s> does not VMT-entail a foo _:b (bnodes don't match literals in the Valentines day MT).  </s>
<s> Thus, if we choose the Valentines day MT, we are not ruling out RDF2 choosing tidy semantics.  </s>
<s> We, are old and tired, we already have agreed enough to meet our charter.  </s>
<s> We should postpone work on the semantics of inline literals for a new and fresh working group.  </s>
<s> Obviously, I have been an advocate of untidiness for a while; if the grouo has consensus to go with untidiness, then I clearly would be in favour.  </s>
<s> However, I would also be very surprised.  </s>
<s> If any of the group cannot live with Part 2, but could accept some sort of compromise of the sort outlined above, then they would get my support.  </s>
<s> Another way to go would be for us to collectively downgrade the tidiness issue.  </s>
<s> My take, is that with the values in the graph, the decision for tidy or untidy is much less pointed.  </s>
<s> Although I would value the debate, I believe my position has changed from "cannot live with tidy" to simply a preference for untidy.  </s>
<s> If we all can downgrade our previously strong opinions then a debate and asimple majority decision would suffice.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Bravo Jeremy.  </s>
<s> While I would myself prefer to also have untidy semantics for inline literals, Jeremy's proposed middle ground of adopting untidy syntax with unspecified semantics has the significant benefits of (a) letting us postpone the decision about tidy vs. untidy semantics, while still (b) providing an abstract syntax that supports either interpretation.  </s>
<s> I wholeheartedly support this proposal, whether or not we also still decide to consider the semantics of inline literals.  </s>
<s> (specific comments below) [Patrick Stickler, Nokia/Finland, (+358 50) 483 9453, patrick.stickler@nokia.com]  </s>
<s> Which I presume would actually be written a foo _:x"literal" .  </s>
<s> b bar _:y"literal" .  </s>
<s> Right?  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> The nice thing here is that we can choose either tidy or untidy semantics merely by adding closure rules to the MT, without any change to the concrete or abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> Sweet.  </s>
<s> Thus, if we want tidy semantics, then we simply assert that each non-explicitly-typed literal denotes the unicode string portion of its label.  </s>
<s> If the graph contains the node (_:x, "LLL"), then I((_:x, "LLL")) = I("LLL").  </s>
<s> And if we want untidy semantics, then we assert that the systemID portion of a non-expliticly typed literal denotes some datatype, typically disambiguated by a rdfs:range assertion, e.g. if the graph contains the triples ddd rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .  </s>
<s> aaa bbb (_:x, "LLL") .  </s>
<s> bbb rdfs:range ddd .  </s>
<s> then I((_:x, "LLL")) = I((ddd, "LLL")) Very nice indeed.  </s>
<s> And we could even pre-specify the extensions to the MT for the tidy versus untidy interpretations, so that application developers can have a solid basis to choose one or the other, and a place to point to that is official, even if non-normative.  </s>
<s> If we cannot agree on the semantics of inline literals, then I think that Part 1 with the above addition of untidy syntax for inline literals, and pre-defined MT extensions for tidy versus untidy semantics would be a far more complete and reasonable solution than Part 1 alone, as presently defined.  </s>
<s> Though I think we should still give strong consideration to untidy semantics.  </s>
<s> If Part 1 were extended with untidy syntax, and the semantics of inline literals was left agnostic (allowing applications to assert either tidy or untidy without running foul of the MT) then I would be satisfied with that.  </s>
<s> I am not, however, prepared to downgrade my position from "cannot live with tidy semantics" as I feel that tidy semantics of inline (non-typed) literals is fundamentally wrong.  </s>
<s> Regards, Patrick  </s>
<s> I agree with Jeremy in the following points: (1) At this point, we should aim for the minimum specification that we can all agree is needed (2) I have a slight preference for untyped literals being untidy, but that preference is somewhat lessened by the availability of explicitly typed literals (rationale: the use of explicit typing pushes many of the consistency checking issues to being some form, of simple schema-consistency computation; for the few remaining cases where long-range typing really is required, the introduction of explicit bNodes is not such a burden [my interpretation of an observation of Brian's]).  </s>
<s> (3) I find very attractive the option of leaving semantics very weak for untyped literals (in this revision of the spec).  </s>
<s> But...  </s>
<s> There is one point I think should be considered, though not necessarily as part of the specification: there are existing applications that use untyped literals -- if we leave their semantics very weak, then there is a probable impediment to participation in a "full-strength" semantic web.  </s>
<s> I think it might be helpful to outline possible migration paths for these applications.  </s>
<s> Consider CC/PP, which currently recommends constructs like: intended to interpreted in conjunction with this schema: rdfs:range rdf:resource='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes#integer'/  </s>
<s> For raster displays, the width of the display in pixels.  </s>
<s> and rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource='http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal'/  </s>
<s> This class is used to represent any CC/PP attribute value that is an integer number.  </s>
<s> rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource= 'http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/xmlschema-2.html#integer'/  </s>
<s> A weak semantics for untyped literals would mean that RDF alone does not define all of the meaning here that would be gleaned by a specific CC/PP application, namely that the value of property 'pix-x' is an integer.  </s>
<s> The RDF meaning would not be wrong, but it would be incomplete.  </s>
<s> A more complete meaning would be available by specifying something like: ccpp-client:pix-x rdf:dattype='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes#integer' 1024 /ccpp-client:pix-x but this would not be compatible with present-day UAPROF and CC/PP specifications.  </s>
<s> The migration path is to point out that the current UAPROF/CCPP is valid (if complete) RDF, and to recommend that future versions recognize an explicit datatype attribute.  </s>

<s> I would rather see the migration path for CC/PP and similar, where the semantics of lexical forms is mandated by fixed property types, to work via long range typing mechanisms.  </s>
<s> I.e., to reflect in RDF what the intended semantics of CC/PP already is, that every value of pix-x is an integer.  </s>
<s> Thus: For ontologies that have strong typing, such as CC/PP, and BTW every ontology I am aware of in use internally in Nokia, having to specify the type for every occurrence of a value is (a) grossly redundant, and (b) hides the fact that the datatype is fixed by property and that one cannot or should not specify some other type locally.  </s>
<s> If RDF cannot officially reflect such long range datatyping semantics, then at the very least, applications should be free to augment the RDF MT with such applications specific semantics, which should be supported by the RDF MT by remaining silent about the meaning of untyped inline literals.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Patrick  </s>
