<s> Fellow Editors: The latest version of Semantics  </s>
<s> has some changes to the subsection organization.  </s>
<s> I mention this in case other documents refer to any sections by name.  </s>
<s> The changes are: Section numbers 3.n 4.n and 5.n are all changed n/n+1, so for example 3.2.3 is now 3.3.3,  </s>
<s> etc. .  </s>
<s> All the old anchors still go to the same section as before, even though the section number has changed.  </s>
<s> Sections 5 main title is changed to 5. Interpreting Datatypes The sections 3.1 RDF Interpretations (anchor #RDFINTERP) 4.1 RDFS Interpretations (#RDFSINTERP) 5.1 Datatyped Interpretations (#DTYPEINTERP) are all new: they each contain the material which was formerly the 'first part' of sections 3, 4 and 5 respectively.  </s>
<s> This is the bulk of the precise normative material after section 1.  </s>
<s> This was done in order to make the normative RFC 2119 stuff about semantic extensions in section 0.1 more precise.  </s>
<s> It now reads: "Semantic extensions of RDF MUST conform to the semantic conditions for simple interpretations described in sections 1.3 and 1.4 and 1.5 and those for RDF interpretations described in section 3.1 of this document.  </s>
<s> " With the earlier (lack of) organization, it was impossible to exactly pin down the material need in this reference.  </s>

<s> I'm trying to audit changes since last call...  </s>
<s> Hmm... that's the same address you gave during the telcon, Pat.  </s>
<s> I was silly enough to take the md5sum without making a copy.  </s>
<s> So I don't have a copy of the document relevant to the WG decision.  </s>
<s> I suppose that doesn't matter all that much, since not many members of the WG read the version that Pat cited in the meeting.  </s>
