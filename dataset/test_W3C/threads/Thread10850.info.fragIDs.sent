<s> [Tim Bray:]  </s>
<s> Taken at another level, more crassly sociological, XML has a greater chance of widespread adoption if it doesn't "look weird" to the world's several million HTML hacks.  </s>
<s> Someone, please, explain why this fear is unfounded.  </s>
<s> Because I would really like to have a syntactically-obvious EMPTY element in XML.  </s>
<s> Or (serious question) is invading HTML's turf a non-goal of XML?  </s>
<s> I'll try.  </s>
<s> Invading HTML's turf should be a goal, but cleverly disguising XML as HTML isn't necessarily the best way to do it.  </s>
<s> I am not too worried about frightening the HTML hack with weird looking delimiters.  </s>
<s> In fact, for the moment, I'm even willing to consider ideas that might make XML "look weird" to today's crop of WWW browsers.  </s>
<s> Here are some of my reasons: 1) SGML already looks weird to the world's HTML hacks.  </s>
<s> (or, If HTML looks good, I wanna look bad!) I doubt that the majority of the world's several million HTML hacks have ever seen an 8879 conformant document in their lives.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that any flavor of SGML we come up with can have more than a passing resemblance to the bag-'o-tags they know as HTML.  </s>
<s> They're already going to have to learn a lot about XML and HTML (i.e. what elements are required within others, you can't overlap elements, etc.) anyhow.  </s>
<s> A different looking tag delimiter isn't necessarily going to hurt that process, and might even help.  </s>
<s> 2) HTML already looks weird to the world's HTML hacks.  </s>
<s> Many web page authors are using tools such as Netscape Gold, Microsoft's Internet Assistant, SoftQuad's HotMetal, etc.  </s>
<s> They really don't know, or want to know what HTML looks like.  </s>
<s> Our audience will more likely be the tool-smiths and browser makers.  </s>
<s> I think they'll accept a different looking br tag if there's a clean, simple, precise specification of XML. 3) HTML hacks are a fickle sort.  </s>
<s> I have the feeling that these proverbial HTML hacks do not have any strong loyalty to HTML, or the RFC.  </s>
<s> They'll happily jump on the next "cool thing" to come along if it offers them the chance to enhance their website with "3-D sense-around in stereo".  </s>
<s> XML ought to provide (part of) the infrastructure to support these cool toys.  </s>
<s> (Hmmm ... maybe we should try to make XML look like Java :-)) 4) HTML is dead, long live HTxML.  </s>
<s> HTML is, IMO, increasingly being viewed as a presentation format, to be assembled on the fly.  </s>
<s> Larger web-site Internet and Intranet publishers are realizing that they have issues with document management, information reusability, and information searchability when they try to author to today's popular browser.  </s>
<s> They need SGML, but the entry cost has been too high because of its complexity.  </s>
<s> The demand for low-cost, robust, powerful SGML is there.  </s>
<s> XML can address this demand.  </s>
<s> Make it so it is super easy for our CS grad to assemble tools to process it, and the tools will proliferate.  </s>
<s> Many of them will take the form of XML- HTML CGI scripts.  </s>
<s> Put powerful tools in the hands of the WebMeister, and he'll know what to do with them.  </s>
<s> I think our initial target market is the Internet/Intranet publisher.  </s>
<s> Our champion in cracking that market is the WebMeister who finds in XML a tool that helps him solve his employer's problems.  </s>
<s> I don't believe he'll be overly concerned with how closely XML resembles HTML, as long as its rules are easily understandable with a minimum of special cases.  </s>
<s> With a sufficiently simple design, it won't take too long before browsers and search robots which can take advantage of XML's  </s>
<s> expressive power are implemented.  </s>
<s> Web page authors will move to XML because of the new things it lets them do, not because all they need to do is replace " HTML " with " HTXML ", and make sure they've explicitly opened and closed all the elements.  </s>
<s> For as long as possible, I'd like to keep the primary focus on those first four design principles identified in DD-1996-0001.  </s>
<s> When forced to choose between simplicity and elegance, or making it look like HTML, my inclination is toward doing the Right Thing(TM).  </s>
<s> -Bill William D. Lindsey blindsey@bdmtech.com  </s>
<s> If Web page authors can't reference other web pages, or be referenced by them, without a seamless interface in their XML tools they will not care a fig for the extra things they can do with XML.  </s>
<s> At present XML is only likely to be of interest to corporations who specifically do not want their information made generally available on the Web.  </s>

<s> I have not had time to study all the issues that this argument impacts, however, I believe that if the results of our efforts are only used by large publishers/corporations we will have missed an opportunity to serve the greatest need.  </s>
<s> When I look around at of the information trapped on the web in presentational markup, aka HTML, I get depressed.  </s>
<s> When written, most authors are only responding to the pressure to get a page on the web and viewable with the browser de-jour.  </s>
<s> However, later I need to make better use of that information and am unable to because of the complete lack of non-presentational semantics.  </s>
<s> Please, XML must be able to  </s>
<s> improve the value of the millions of web pages.  </s>
<s> Do we agree with this goal?  </s>
<s> Dave Hollander  </s>
<s> In my former life I probably worked with more varieties of broken HTML than anyone should ever have to.  </s>
<s> Perhaps as a result of this, I believe there is little value in structuring XML to catch the output of Joe Homepage.  </s>
<s> That said, it is nonetheless clear that it would be good if XML could be read by HTML browsers.  </s>
<s> Basically, I think that anything on the Web that is worth saving was created by somebody with a modicum of care, such that it could easily be turned into a valid form or (even more likely) the HTML was generated from something else anyhow, thus would be easily replaced by XML.  </s>
<s> The design compromises involved in attempting to grandfather the population of bogus pseudo-HTML documents seem way too expensive at this point in time.  </s>

<s> HTML gets a lot of support.  </s>
<s> The adopters of SGML who have invested a lot of resources in sticking with the standards, creating well-modeled data, in other words, playing to the rules have taken the shaft from the WWW.  </s>
<s> I am much more interested in enabling Internet access to SGML as practiced than I am in fixing the problems of bad practice.  </s>
<s> /soapbox XML is to simplify SGML.  </s>
<s> I currently use a browser that already does this.  </s>
<s> In no way does its features make it something only a large publisher or corporation can use.  </s>
<s> All a user has to do is define elements and create a stylesheet for them.  </s>
<s> That's all point and click.  </s>
<s> If they want to use a DTD, they can write one and batch validate.  </s>
<s> That works.  </s>
<s> If they want to do configured editing, take the DTD and give it to a validation editor like SoftQuad's Author/Editor and tell the browser that is the editor to call when asked.  </s>
<s> Easy.  </s>
<s> A bit cheaper editor is needed, but that would be an immediate benefit of XML.  </s>
<s> Yes. That is a situation created by vendors and willing authors.  </s>
<s> It will not change because we tell them to.  </s>
<s> It is a manufactured crisis.  </s>
<s> Only the availability of alternatives and the need and will to use them will alter that course.  </s>
<s> The goal is too ambiguous to agree to as stated.  </s>
<s> We can't, we musn't weaken XML to fix the problems that popular bad practice creates.  </s>
<s> We can certainly state that the HTML 3.2 DTD is one which *should* be expressible as an XML DTD.  </s>
<s> But there are many other sources of legacy and their requirements are also important.  </s>
<s> It may be that HTML 3.2 has to change to meet XMLs requirements.  </s>
<s> That is not unthinkable.  </s>
<s> This is, after all, a W3C working group.  </s>
<s> If the WG8 members present are helping to ensure that the revision of SGML and the creation of XML are cooperative, isn't it reasonable to expect the same of the owners of the HTML DTD?  </s>
<s> So, yes, I agree XML must improve the value of the work of those who create web pages, because where HTML is an XML application, it falls within the goals to provide simpler SGML.  </s>
<s> Where it is not and can't be, then any overlap is coincidental.  </s>

<s> The ERB wishes to clarify the discussion arising from the suggestion that we make it possible to grandfather existing valid HTML documents as valid XML documents without changing them in any way.  </s>
<s> We certainly do wish to make Joe Homepage comfortable, but we wish to accomplish this by moving him into a new home.  </s>
<s> The way to do this is to ensure that existing valid HTML documents can straightforwardly be converted to XML documents without any loss of information using a generally available normalization tool.  </s>
<s> In particular, it should be easy for the developers of XML applications such as XML Web browsers to build in converters that will map HTML to XML on the fly.  </s>
<s> But a requirement that existing valid HTML documents be valid XML documents with no changes whatsoever would impose unacceptable limitations on our ability to design the best possible SGML application profile for documents on the Web.  </s>
<s> It is a design goal of XML to function as a metalanguage for document markup on the Web.  </s>
<s> It is not a design goal of XML to automatically grandfather in existing HTML documents or documents conformant to any other specific SGML markup language.  </s>
