<s> To make the minimum requirements for checkpoint 4.13 simpler, I suggest the  </s>
<s> following change to limit the scope of the checkpoint to only changing colors:  </s>
<s> 4.13 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] 4.13 Allow the user to configure the color used to highlight a selection.  </s>
<s> Make available the range of system colors.  </s>

<s> Hi, I propose instead requiring the user agent to implement at least one mechanism  </s>
<s> other than changing colors (since color alone might cause problems for  </s>
<s> some users).  </s>
<s> We can suggest, for example, underlining, or a box, and point to CSS focus rectangles.  </s>

<s> Ian, We do require exporting information on selection to AT. But I would be interested in other peoples opinons.  </s>
