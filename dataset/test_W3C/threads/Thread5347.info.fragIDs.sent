<s> One small, but measurable, good we might do is to specify how to use Dublin Core Metadata elements in OWL-S.  </s>
<s> This is cropping up in WSDL (at my instigation) to handle versioning of interfaces and files, so we might as well thrash some out here.  </s>
<s> For example, we have the property on a profile "textDescriptoin".  </s>
<s> Why not either sameProperty or subProperty dc:description?  </s>
<s> Or, better yet, just *use* dc:description?  </s>
<s> I notice we restrict the textDescription cardinality to being 1.  </s>
<s> That 1) precludes providing translations of the description in different languages, thus hurting internationalization and 2) precludes having different "level" of description, say, suitable for a tooltip as opposed to a web page, or for a novice rather than an expert.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> Well, I don't exactly object, but I'm not sure I see the motivation, either.  </s>
<s> I thought Dublin Core was mainly about classifying documents, like for library purposes.  </s>
<s> I'm not aware that it has anything to say about services (?). OK, a service is a resource, and I guess Dublin Core is basic provenance for any kind of resource.  </s>
<s> But if there are only one or two DC elements  </s>
<s> that apply (description, name), I'm not sure it it's worth the added  </s>
<s> overhead of using it.  </s>
<s> The more there are, the more useful it seems.  </s>
<s> I agree that we shouldn't have the cardinality restriction on text Description.  </s>
<s> Cheers, David  </s>
<s> Yep.  </s>
<s> dc:creator, dc:publisher, dc:relation (with the various subProperties, isVersionOf, replaces, etc.), I'm unsure about the temporal and geographic coverage ones, rights, date.  </s>
<s> I agree that it might be a stretch in some cases, but it also seems worth investigating.  </s>
<s> yeah, that's a no brainer, I think.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> I'll decloak for a moment to say: yes, this is desirable but there are certain ambiguities in the use of DC that would need to be addressed -  </s>
<s> danbri has done a nice Wiki page on the topic at [1].  </s>
<s> He's talking primarily about dc:creator, but it's likely that similar semantic vagueness occurs elsewhere in DC.  </s>
<s> It isn't clear whether dc:creator relates documents to people, or to their names.  </s>
<s> For historical reasons, DC has had a concern with 'dumbing down', to allow simple and complex metadata to co-exist.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>
<s> [1] http://rdfweb.org/topic/UsingDublinCoreCreator  </s>
<s> I'm aware of this (and other) ambiguities.  </s>
<s> I'm unclear if they *need* to be addressed, or rather, how :) dc:description seems pretty safe :)  </s>
<s> I don't think it's dumbdown that causes *this* problem.  </s>
<s> It's more likely to stem either from the various multiple formats (HTML, XML) and a focus on cataloging rather than kr.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> We want to be careful about adding many attributes for annotations...much  </s>
<s> like we want to try to cluster the various attributes of OWL-S into more fundamental classes of things.  </s>
<s> I suggest that all annotations in OWL-S are clustered into a single "annotation" type that we can then sub-class into desirable sets of different notations with different types or properties.  </s>
<s> So all  </s>
<s> textural/string attributes can be clustered and it can be understood when some are related to others - e.g. different language variants of a textual description or tooltip.  </s>
<s> I suggest that all annotations are of form key=value where arbitrarily complex values are allows... and (but this is less obvious) I think reasonably complex keys might be useful... not restricted to some simple symbol name.  </s>
<s> Austin  </s>
<s> Well, I'm mostly talking about avoiding proliferating roughly equivalent properties.  </s>
<s> Dublin Core is a central vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Well, that's the design for *some* parts of OWL-S, namely serviceParameter.That's *not* the design for some other properties, like textDescription.  </s>
<s> I don't much care about making Yet Another Wrapper for dublin core without a direct motivation.  </s>
<s> Dublin Core doesn't work that way, so we'd have to rework that.  </s>
<s> Pfft.  </s>
<s> So all textural/string attributes can be clustered and it can be understood when some are related to others - e.g. different language variants of a textual description or tooltip.  </s>
<s> Usually done with an xml:lang.  </s>
<s> I would love if the Dublin Core got more sophisticated about complex content.  </s>
