<s> Here are some comments: (Note this largely duplicates a report I have sent to jena-devel - I took the same action for two groups) Blank Nodes in OWL DL Here is a report on blank nodes with potential review comments.  </s>
<s> Blank nodes in OWL Lite/DL can be categorized as: - unnamed individuals - unnamed class descriptions (DL only) - unnamed ontologies - data ranges (DL only) - restrictions - all different (highly restricted idiom) - various sorts of lists - lists of named individuals - lists of descriptions/restrictions/classIDs - lists of literal values (DL only) They are subject to a variety of restrictions, i.e. excluding all triples with predicate owl:equivalentClass and owl:disjointWith we have: - no blank node can be the object of more than one triple - no cycles of blank nodes are permitted - lists and data ranges must be the object of at least one triple In OWL DL restriction and description blank nodes and classIDs may participate in subgraphs labelled with owl:equivalentClass and owl:disjointWith.  </s>
<s> Blank nodes in such graphs may not be the object of any other triples.  </s>
<s> They may be the object of many triples in such subgraphs, and such subgraphs may contain cycles.  </s>
<s> However, the subgraph of an OWL DL graph, consisting of the edges labelled with owl:disjointWith, when viewed as an undirected graph, must be the union of complete subgraphs (i.e. in which every node is connected to every other node) where each pair of subgraphs in the union only intersect in classID nodes (i.e. urirefs).  </s>
<s> The constraints on the subgraph of an OWL DL graph consisting of the edges labelled with owl:equivalentClass is worse, and involves Hamiltonians cycles, and I don't think I can write it down.  </s>
<s> Recognizing such structures is NP complete.  </s>
<s> See Two options for simplifying the blank node structures are: A permit description and restriction nodes to be the object of multiple triples (still forbidding cycles) B permit unnamed individual nodes to be used cyclically and to be the object of multiple triples.  </s>
<s> Option A can be achieved by the following addition to the preamble to the mapping rules in section 4.1: Bnode identifiers here are local to each transformation.  </s>
<s> When the construct being transformed matches the *restriction* or *description* productions from the abstract syntax then the bnode may be shared between multiple identical transformations of identical *restriction*s or *description*s.  </s>
<s> Otherwise the bnode used in each transformation should be unique for each invocation of a transformation rule.  </s>
<s> This complete simplifies the mess to do with owl:disjointWith and owl:equivalentClass (The rule becomes that cycles of blank nodes must include an edge labelled with owl:disjointWith or owl:equivalentClass) There are technical difficulties in one of the proofs.  </s>
<s> These difficulties amount to the validity of the following entailment in OWL Full: OWL Full entails The inverse entailment is trivial.  </s>
<s> (The pattern is a complex description used twice - the premises have two different unnamed instances of the complex description, the conclusions have a single unnamed instance) If this entailment holds (in general), then the suggested change is correct, and a (significant) improvement.  </s>
<s> If the entailment is not true in general then the OWL Test Cases should include one of the examples of a non-entailment.  </s>
<s> (Triples with object being a blank description or restriction node must have property: owl:equivalentClass owl:disjointWith rdfs:subClassOf rdf:type owl:someValuesFrom owl:allValuesFrom rdf:first (in a list of description, which is then used in an owl:unionOf or owl:intersectionOf triple) Option B concerning unnamed individuals could be achieved by having a semantics for OWL DL which treated blank nodes as existentially quantified names, like in the RDF semantics.  </s>
<s> Then locally scoped identifiers would be included in the OWL abtstract syntax, and could be used to construct abstract syntax trees that map onto cyclic  </s>

<s> individual( locally-scoped-name-A value( #property locally-scoped-name-A ) ) would map onto the triple: _:A #property _:A .  </s>
<s> Comments summary:  </s>
<s> - It is a mistake that owl:equivalentClass rules make OWL DL recognition an NP complete problem.  </s>
<s> This should be fixed.  </s>
<s> - The rules concerning blank nodes and triples labelled with owl:disjointWith and owl:equivalentClass are very complicated.  </s>
<s> S&amp;AS should articulate them.  </s>
<s> This would help for example when building an OWL DL recogizer.  </s>
<s> - Permitting blank nodes representing descriptions and restrictions to be used as the object of more than one triple should be considered.  </s>
<s> A rationale for not doing so should be given preferably as a test case in OWL Full showing an OWL Full non-entailment that would hold in OWL DL if such a change were made.  </s>
<s> A sample test case is included.  </s>
<s> - RDF Core have found it a mistake to have a limited syntax for bnodes.  </s>
<s> We suggest that permitting cycles of unnamed individuals, and permitting unnamed individuals to be the object of more than one triple would be advantageous.  </s>

<s> I had an action to make comments about the blank node structures as part of the process of RDF Core review of S&amp;AS.  </s>
<s> (Particularly section 4)  </s>
<s> In terms of why I think RDF Core might wish to consider making these comments (at the end of the message) 1: Our semantics doc says: Specifications of such syntactically restricted semantic extensions MUST include a specification of their syntactic conditions which are sufficient to enable software to distinguish unambiguously those RDF graphs to which the extended semantic conditions apply.  </s>
<s> 2: RDF has taken blank nodes in one direction; OWL DL takes them in a different direction - I at least believe this might cause interoperability problems between OWL and RDF.  </s>
<s> I think all the comments are jsutified by these two motivations.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Aha, that's the context I am missing.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I have no objection to these comments, but I'm mildly concerned that we (the RDFcore group) may be getting involved rather deeply in another group's design.  </s>

<s> Wow, this is pretty hairy stuff.  </s>
<s> I agree with Graham about interfering in another WG's design.  </s>
<s> I found it pretty hard to separate out what you are proposing RDFCore say to webont.  </s>
<s> Only the summary at the end looks appropriate.  </s>
<s> I also found some surprises in these, e.g. the restrictions on b-nodes, so I'm suggesting in another message adding a further general comment.  </s>
<s> I suggest the following amendments: owlsas-rdfcore-np-complete RDFCore notes the a consequence of the rules for owl:equivalentClass is that distinguishing OWL DL from OWL Full has complexity NP complete and suggests WEBONT investigate whether this complexity can be reduced.  </s>
<s> owlsas-rdfcore-rules-complexity The rules concerning blank nodes and triples labelled with owl:disjointWith and owl:equivalentClass are complicated and difficult to understand.  </s>
<s> RDFCore suggests WEBONT consider whether a clearer exposition of these rules is possible.  </s>
<s> This would help implementors, for example, when building an OWL DL recognizer.  </s>
<s> owlsas-rdfcore-bnodes-restrictions RDFCore are concerned that restrictions placed on b-nodes will limit the applicability of OWL DL to an unecessarily restricted subset of RDF instance data, for which no such restrictions apply.  </s>
<s> Specifically we request, that in Owl DL and Owl lite: a) that a b-node representing an individual may be the object of more than one triple b) that cycles of b-nodes representing individuals be allowed.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Softened this - I'm not sure we know enough to say that its a mistake.  </s>
<s> Anyway, as I understand this, this is helpful comment as WEBONT already have a fix and just need a comment to hang it on to.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure this is a matter for RDFCore.  </s>
<s> This is an aspect of the design of Owl DL.  </s>
<s> I don't understand the bit about articulate.  </s>
<s> Are these rules not implied in the spec?  </s>
<s> I guess you mean they are, but they should be spelled out more clearly.  </s>
<s> That's what I've written above.  </s>
<s> This seems like an internal matter for Owl.  </s>
<s> Why does RDFCore care about this?  </s>
<s> Its not clear to me that RDFCore understand the issues well enough to say that its a mistake.  </s>
<s> We can say we don't like it.  </s>
