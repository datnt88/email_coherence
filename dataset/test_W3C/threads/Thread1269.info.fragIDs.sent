<s> Well, Take 2 was completely destroyed by an early click on the wrong button, so let's try again.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the noise.  </s>
<s> This message is the initial part of a test of Take 3 of interoperability of UTF-8 on the Internet.  </s>
<s> The reason for having a new test is that the initial round did not test any characters beyond the BMP (character number  0xFFFF).  </s>
<s> The test is based on a test file of plain text encoded in UTF-8, containing text in a few languages and scripts.  </s>
<s> The test file was composed in Windows 2000 Notepad and is attached to this message as test-utf-8bis.txt.  </s>
<s> It has an initial BOM (Byte Order Mark).  </s>
<s> The content of the test file, copy-pasted into this message is: ------------------ snip ---------------------  </s>
<s> UTF-8 interop test Espa??ol: ??Hola!  </s>
<s> T??rk??e: Merhaba  </s>
<s> ------------------ snip --------------------- Also attached is test-utf-8bis.jpg, a JPEG screen shot showing the test file in Windows 2000 Wordpad.  </s>
<s> Wordpad is used here because Notepad allows only a single font for the whole file, which is insufficient as I do not have a single font containing glyphs for all the scripts in the test file.  </s>
<s> To get correct display in Wordpad, it is sufficient to set an adequate font (James Kass' Code2001 here) on the last line, which is in the non-BMP Gothic script).  </s>
<s> Also attached is test-utf-8bis.html, an HTML version of the same text.  </s>
<s> Instead of a BOM, this version uses a meta element to identify the charset as UTF-8.  </s>
<s> An interop report will follow as a reply to this message.  </s>

<s> This message reports on Take 3 of interoperability testing of UTF-8 on the Internet.  </s>
<s> The test was initiated by sending a UTF-8 mail message to the ietf-charsets@iana.org  </s>
<s> mailing list.  </s>
<s> The list is archived and the test message can be seen at This message is a reply to the test message.  </s>
<s> Here is an extract of the test message as received from the list:  </s>
<s> Comparing the above as displayed in Outlook 2000 with the JPEG image attached to the test message, one can verify that all but the last line (Gothic script, non-BMP characters) are displayed properly.  </s>
<s> The incorrect display of the last line, however, is purely a rendering problem in a single font environment, as can be ascertained by copy-pasting the above to Windows Wordpard and setting an appropriate font on the last line: the whole thing is displayed correctly, showing that the message body was transmitted faithfully.  </s>
<s> The test message was also sent directly (not through the list) to a POP3 account, from where it was retrieved using Netscape Messenger 7).  </s>
<s> The text displayed in Netscape 7 again matches the original, except for the Gothic line which suffers from a rendering problem; copy-pasting from Netscape 7 to this message, we get: ------------------ snip --------------------- UTF-8 interop test Espa??ol: ??Hola!  </s>
<s> T??rk??e: Merhaba ------------------ snip --------------------- which matches the original.  </s>
<s> Displaying the attachments (both plain text and HTML) of the original message shows the same text when using both MS Outlook 2000 and Netscape 7, with no manual adjustment of encoding needed.  </s>
<s> This part of the test shows that the combination of the SMTP, MIME and POP3 protocols support UTF-8 correctly, as does the mailing list server.  </s>
<s> Another part of the test consists in examining the test message and its attachments as served on the Web at the mailing list archive.  </s>
<s> Browsing to this URL with three different browsers (MSIE 6.0, Netscape 7 and Opera 6.05), one can verify that the text is again reproduced mostly faithfully, without any manual adjustement of encoding, except for the Gothic which does not render correctly (white rectangles) in MSIE.  </s>
<s> Copy-pasting from a browser window to this message, we get: ------------------ snip --------------------- UTF-8 interop test Espa??ol: ??Hola!  </s>
<s> T??rk??e: Merhaba ------------------ snip --------------------- Copying this to Wordpad shows that the data is intact.  </s>
<s> The plain text and HTML attachments are also displayed correctly, with the same caveats for Gothic as above, by all thee browsers.  </s>
<s> This part of the test shows that the combination of the SMTP, MIME and HTTP protocols plus the mail archiving software support UTF-8 correctly, except in some cases for the rendering of the Gothic script (data integrity is preserved, however).  </s>
<s> The only other glitch is that the archiving software truncates the display of some headers (the Subject:, From: as well as the file names displayed for the attachments).  </s>
<s> This appears to be purely a display problem, since the attachments can be reached.  </s>
<s> Fran??ois Yergeau  </s>
<s> I think that in particular for the BOM issue, it would be good to make sure that we get interoperability reports also from Unix/Linux based systems or Macs, but I haven't seen any such  </s>
<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> I accessed the list archive at Netscape 6.2.3 running on Solaris 8. The message and attachments displayed correctly except for the last 2 lines (Arabic and Gothic).  </s>
<s> Saving to a local and examining with 'od -x' showed that the problem was purely rendering, as the UTF-8 data was as expected.  </s>
