<s> I was reading up on the current state of XPointer, XPath and etcetera.  </s>
<s> It occurs to me that, if XPointer ever becomes a Recommendation (1), then it can be used to generalize getElementByID() into a function which can return any point in a document.  </s>
<s> Say we have a function called getElementByXPointer().  </s>
<s> Since XPointer supports ids (2), then: ] getElementByID('1701A') ...could be represented using XPointer as either: ] getElementByXPointer('1701A') ] getElementByXPointer('/1/1/2') ] getElementByXPointer('fed/2') ...in the following XML (3): ] ?xml  </s>
<s> version="1.0"?  </s>
<s> ] ?xml-id  </s>
<s> names="id xcha je"?  </s>
<s> ] starships ] /alien ] alien xcha="klingon" xml:lang="x-klingon" ] ship xcha="IKS7" / ] ship xcha="IKS38k" / ] /alien ] /starships This seems to be a natural generalization of the getElementByID function; it provides more flexiblity and brings some additional functionality to the DOM (an XPointer can return a single element or a set of elements/nodes).  </s>
<s> Is this being considered for the next version of the DOM?  </s>
<s> Jimmy Cerra 1) I really hope XPointer becomes a recommendation, as I like some of the features, such as Child Sequences.  </s>
<s> 2) AKA Bare Names.  </s>
<s> 3) Note that I used a processing instruction to tell you what an id is.  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 3 Working Drafts include a proposal for an XPointer API.  </s>
