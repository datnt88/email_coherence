<s> Hello! I've been using your service for a long time, and yesterday I made a request as a postscript (a web page as a postcript: I think this will save the pictures, won't it?) The problem is that the returned postscript is not valid!  </s>
<s> I tried to open it with several programs (GhostScript, I even tried to convert it to other format -pdf-) but I get an error message!  </s>
<s> Am I doing something wrong, or is it a bug?  </s>
<s> Note that I tested several sites, and noone was successfully sent.  </s>
<s> Yours, Fernando Rodriguez  </s>
<s> I detect this problem yesterday, when I request a page in this format.  </s>
<s> I'm using Adobe Acrobat to read PS file and It fail.  </s>

<s> Try opening the file in a text editor and see what it contains.. My guess is that it probably contains an error message.  </s>
<s> BTW which server do you use?  </s>
<s> Thanks Clement Onime  </s>
