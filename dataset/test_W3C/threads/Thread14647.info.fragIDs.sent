<s> Per my action item from last call here's a first cut at a new guideline: Guideline X. Design for so that testability can most easily be verified.  </s>
<s> Pages should be designed to minimize amount of human effort needed to confirm accessibility.  </s>
<s> checkpoint x.1 Specify in machine readable form specifications against which machine verification may be preformed.  </s>
<s> Example: in HTML include the DOCTYPE.  </s>
<s> checkpoint x.2 Avoid use of alternative version of content that requires human effort to verify.  </s>
<s> Example: Avoid when possible manually created images of text; use styled text instead.  </s>
<s> Note that automated generation of images of text are allowed per checkpoint x.3 checkpoint x.3 When alternative versions of content are created, create them automatically when possible.  </s>
<s> Example: A program that automatically converts text to images checkpoint x.4 When alternative content is created manually, make specific correspondence between content and its particular alternative.  </s>
<s> Negative Example: A manually created alternative text-only site in which information is distributed differently among ithe pages.  </s>
<s> Validating the equivalence of such a manually created site is very labor intensive.  </s>
<s> Positive Example: Image and ALT text.  </s>
<s> It's simple for a tool to present image and ALT tag to user for comparison (e.g. in A-Prompt and in the Wave) Positive Example: Content provided by Object tag and nested object tag.  </s>
<s> Positive Example: Two sites created from common data through different transformations, PROVIDED that the transformation rules are publically visible for validation.  </s>
<s> checkpoint x.5 When possible, Use only styles linked consistently to particular semantic objects.  </s>
<s> Example: CSS rule that makes all Headings a particular style.  </s>
<s> Negative Example: CSS rule linked to class.  </s>
<s> Current CSS has no way to expose class semantics to user agent, so it takes human judgment to decide if the class is simply decorative, which is harmless, or is carrying information unavailable to user agents.  </s>

<s> Keep in mind that the stated reason the 508 rules did not embrace more of the WCAG 1.0 P1 checkpoints is that they were not objective (i.e., testable) enough.  </s>

<s> OK. Here is my understanding: guidelines are things that people write to tell people what to do in certain situations, or for certain purposes.  </s>
<s> SO clearly, we want to produce somethng that is useful as guidelines.  </s>
<s> standards are things that everybody uses, largely because they think it is helpful if people are using the same things.  </s>
<s> Cleraly, we would like everyone to use WCAG 2.0 (leaving aside for a minte the issue of whether people will haveto do everything listed, or everything possible, if those happen to be different), so it sounds to me like we are trying to write a standard.  </s>
<s> W3C is a standards body, as far as I understand the term.  </s>
<s> We work to build broad consensus on "recommendations" for how to do things (like write XML, or make authoring tools accessible), and publish them.  </s>
<s> We then hope they become standards.  </s>
<s> From there it becomes a question of splitting semantic hairs - the terms are too broad in english for the debate.  </s>
<s> (If WCAG were being produced in the context of Indian federal government publications there might be tighter definitions that we could use, but they aren't - they are being published by an international consortium for international use.  </s>
