<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> My understanding is JAWS will read forms with title tags in them as long  </s>
<s> as there isn't a label associated with it.  </s>
<s> I know for sure JAWS will read title tags in a tags, provided the user has their settings set properly.  </s>
<s> Window-Eyes will read titles for forms that don't have a label in them.  </s>
<s> However, Window=-Eyes will not read title tags in the a tag.  </s>
<s> When I asked GW Micro, the creators of Window-Eyes if they could add this feature, they said they didn't see the need.  </s>
<s> Hope that helps!  </s>

<s> This is particularly confusing given that there was a recent proposal on www-html to allow multiple title elements and include them in the body as an alternative ot the head (I don't think it was well received, but it was made).  </s>
<s> At first I thought you were talking about that proposal until I realised you really meant title attributes.  </s>
<s> I only have experience with JAWS, and I'm guessing you mean the title attribute.  </s>
<s> We happen to have tested this just today.  </s>
<s> It can - if you make it so it reads tooltips.  </s>
<s> That's under...uh...  </s>
<s> I only have that at work.  </s>
<s> You have to get into the configuration management, which I forget the right options for.  </s>
<s> Then, it's Set Options - Verbosity Options - your current level's Preferences - Tooltip.  </s>
<s> That's with JAWS 4.02, I believe it is.  </s>

<s> Yes, that is what I meant.  </s>
<s> The title attribute, like: Sorry for the confusion.  </s>

<s> I understand that jaws version 4 and above allows you to set what type of alternative text attribute is read.  </s>
<s> Either alt, title, on-screen text, or the longest of those if more than one exists.  </s>
<s> I also understand that the new version of Jaws (4.5) allows you to set a kind of cascade for the alternative texts.  </s>
<s> so that for example, the longest of them is read first, otherwise alt is read first if it exists, or then title, then the on-screen text, then... src (for images etc. i assume) ... and so on.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if different cascades can be set like this for different html elements other than links or graphics.  </s>
<s> With forms, I think that Jaws will still try to read the label if it exists.  </s>
<s> Hope this info is useful.  </s>
<s> Mat.  </s>
