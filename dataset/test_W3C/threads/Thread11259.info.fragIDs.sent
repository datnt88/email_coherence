<s> Comments on Part 1: Encoding declaration The current draft requires that all text entities have encoding declarations unless they are encoded in UTF-8.  </s>
<s> (1) Internal entities Does this requiement apply to internal entities?  </s>
<s> Is it possible to apply different encodings to internal entities?  </s>
<s> The current draft is not very clear about this.  </s>
<s> (2) Duplication of encoding declarations.  </s>
<s> Suppose that we have a document comprising one document entity and one hundred external text entities.  </s>
<s> I believe that these external text entities should not be required to duplicate the same encoding declaration.  </s>
<s> The encoding specified for the root entity or an external text entity should be inherited by directly-referenced external entities, unless they have encoding declarations or they begin with a Byte Order Mark.  </s>
<s> (3) Autodetection Encoding information might be given by Internet protocols (http, SMTP, etc.).  </s>
<s> In Japan, there are many programs that automatically detect EUC_JP, Shift_JIS, and ISO_2022_JP.  </s>
<s> Some future implementations of XML will perform even more educated guess, as XML documents have a number of !,  , /, and / .  </s>
<s> (4) Proposed changes If an external text entity does not begin with a Byte Order Mark or an encoding declaration, XML processors may assume that this entity is in the same encoding as the entity that references to it.  </s>
<s> If a document entity does not begin with a Byte Order Mark or an encoding declaration, XML processors may assume that this entity is in the UTF-8 encoding.  </s>
<s> XML processors may use other information to detect the actual encoding method, but are not required to do so.  </s>

<s> How could it?  </s>
<s> An encoding converts a sequence of bytes into a sequence of  </s>
<s> characters.  </s>
<s> The replacement text of an external entity is a sequence of bytes, so it needs an encoding to convert it into a sequence of characters.  </s>
<s> But the replacement text of an internal entity has been parsed and so is already a sequence of characters.  </s>
<s> SP does this.  </s>
<s> If you don't specify an encoding it gets inherited.  </s>
<s> I think of this as being similar to relative URLs.  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> You are right and I am not disagreeing.  </s>
<s> But I would like the draft to be clearer.  </s>
<s> Again, the draft should be clearer.  </s>
