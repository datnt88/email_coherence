<s> ISSUES with 2.1 1) Need a good definition for operable Bug # 346 - concerns - that infinite tabbing isn't operable 2) "at a minimum" is ambiguous Bug#: 410 3) Is "ON CLICK" an exception since it is supported from keyboards?  </s>
<s> Bug#: 490 http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=490 4) how much keyboard access is the responsibility of the webpage designer versus the capability of the specific browser being used Bug#: 561 http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=561 5) Would it be possible to include an example alternative coding method here?  </s>
<s> Bug#: 583 http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=583 6) Need definition for "functionality or its outcome that can be expressed in words" [gl] 7) define "event handlers" in the glossary (and refer to the definition here), and also discuss what makes them more or less abstract.  </s>
<s> [gl] CURRENT WORDING: Guideline 2.1 All functionality is operable at a minimum through a keyboard or a keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.1 all of the functionality of the content, where the functionality or its outcome can be expressed in words, is operable at a minimum through a keyboard or keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> [X] Note: refer to guideline 4.3 for information regarding user agent support.  </s>
<s> Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.1 wherever a choice between event handlers is available and supported, the more abstract event is used.  </s>
<s> [X] Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.1 No level 3 success criteria for this guideline.  </s>
<s> PAST PROPOSALS Defintion of: operable through a keyboard interface" Content is operable when it is properly designed in a way that all the information is reachable and all the funcionality is available through an efficient use of a keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> An appropriate hierarchical collection of keyboard shortcuts or a navigation bar situated after each section strengthens operability.  </s>
<s> Intensive use of tabbing weakens operability due to monotony and lack of a clear structure.  </s>
<s> "operable at least through keyboard interface" [Exception: onclick, in reality, has become a device independent event handler, normalized through broad adoption by Web browser and AT developers].  </s>
<s> We agree that a webpage should be navigatable by keyboard commands.  </s>
<s> However, there is always the issue of how much keyboard access is the responsibility of the webpage designer versus the capability of the specific browser being used by the person accessing the page.  </s>
<s> 2.1 [CORE] Make it possible for people who use only a keyboard or a keyboard interface to operate all functionality .  </s>
<s> SC1. all of the functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard or keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> [js note: Do we have examples of a function or outcome that cannot be expressed in words?  </s>
<s> If not, we should strike the phrase.]  </s>
<s> Note:refer to checkpoint 4.3 for information regarding user agent support.  </s>
<s> SC2 (level 2 or 3).  </s>
<s> wherever the technology that provides functionality allows a choice between specifying the results of a user action and requiring a particular action that depends upon a specific input or output device, the code specifies the desired result instead of the action.  </s>
<s> For example, if the technology supports a choice between an abstract select function and a function that requires a mouse-click, the select function is used.  </s>
<s> Proposal Guideline 2.1 Make all functionality operable (at least) via a keyboard or a keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.1 All of the functionality of the content , where the functionality or its outcome can be expressed in words, is operable (at least) via a keyboard or keyboard interface.  </s>
<s> [X] Note: refer to guideline 4.3?? for information regarding user agent support.  </s>
<s> Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.1 Wherever a choice between input device event handlers is available and supported, the more abstract event is used.  </s>
<s> [X] Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.1 All of the functionality of the content is operable (at least) via a keyboard or keyboard interface in some fashion or degree.  </s>
<s> Definitions: "Functionality or outcome can be expressed in words": This phrase separated functionality that can be accomplished using buttons or command line interfaces from functionality such as fingerpainting that requires continuous analog control of the interface.  </s>
<s> Note: often analog controls are used to operate functionality that could be done via the keyboard.  </s>
<s> For example - an analog volume control could be controlled by tabbing to it and using the up and down arrows to 'turn' the knob or 'slide' the slider.  </s>
<s> This type of control would be covered and should be keyboard controlable.  </s>
<s> Watercolor painting however cannot reasonably be done from the key board in the same way it could with a pressure sensitive brush interface.  </s>
<s> It would not be required under this provision - though a more primitive form of control might be provided at a higher level of accessibility and would be beneficial for many activities.  </s>
<s> "Keyboard interface": On devices that do not have a built in keyboard, there is usually an alternate method for entering text and/or a method for connecting a keyboard to the device.  </s>
<s> Allowing control via the "keyboard interface" means that the content could be controlled through commands issued from the optional keyboard or alternate text entry methods.  </s>
<s> "input device event handlers": Code that handles the input device signals and passes the input on to the applications.  </s>
<s> In HTML some of the event handlers are "on select", "on focus" "on blur".  </s>
<s> "abstract event" refers to input device events.  </s>
<s> More abstract events are events that apply to more than one type of input device such as "on select", "on focus" "on command".  </s>
<s> This is in contrast to event handlers that are input device specific such as "on mouseover", "on doubleclick".  </s>
