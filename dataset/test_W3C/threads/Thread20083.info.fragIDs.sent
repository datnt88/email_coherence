<s> I have two questions a) Is it possible to set a new color and not just the default 152 color palette that tht thot editor allows.  </s>
<s> I know it is possible because of the extended palette feature that the style sheet approach allows custom colors  </s>
<s> b) Changes mad to the stylesheet are not immediately apparent in the editor except if one does a reload of the document.  </s>
<s> Any way of making the changes visible as soon as the change is made in the stylesheet  </s>
<s> Since the 3.2 version, it's possible to set any new color using the CSS notation #RRGGBB, and others.  </s>
<s> We fixed some bugs in the release 3.2 and in the new future version 4.0, but if you have a short scenario where the problem occurs, I'll check that the problem is solved now.  </s>
