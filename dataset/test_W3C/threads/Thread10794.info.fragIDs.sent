<s> I'd like to propose what I take to be an improved approach to the syntax of such things (taking into account some of the decisions already taken).  </s>
<s> I am also putting in the things that I think we should have, that I don't expect some people to like.  </s>
<s> I'm also going to just give examples, rather than a grammar.  </s>
<s> If the examples aren't clear enough to make sense, then that's useful data itself.  </s>
<s> The lack of formal semantics also reinforces the notion that this is a preliminary proposal, not a hard and fast prescription.  </s>
<s> I hope that it may be a wooden (or at least wicker)-man, but even if only a strawman, it may serve a purpose.  </s>
<s> The syntax is not defined because it will be whatever syntax we finally choose for document instances.  </s>
<s> I have used the proposed sdf/ empty tag syntax, as a shining example of syntactic disambiguation.  </s>
<s> !--  </s>
<s> A shortcut to define an attlist, and apply it to an element in one declaration, possibly without even naming it, would prbably be a good idea.  </s>
<s> Perhaps adding: apply-to="element1 element2" to define-attlist would do.  </s>
<s> -- extending="highlighted"/ dtd-doc p This is the way comments should really be done.  </s>
<s> /p  </s>
<s> p We can even add a way to define a dtd fragment for the dtd-doc contents.  </s>
<s> To do this we need to find a way to define the DTD for the contents without preventing the DTD itself from serving as an instance /p /dtd-doc  </s>
<s> !-- Note: except for relaxing the unique keyword-value restriction, all of this can be compiled to SGML by a pretty simple processor.  </s>
<s> -- !-- a mix-in tag.  </s>
<s> Valid at any point in processing of top level of a p .  </s>
<s> Not an inclusion exception -- legal-anywhere-within="p" illegal-anywhere-within="footnote"/ !-- maybe something like contains="#MODEL p" would be nice for inheriting content models from existing elements -- !-- we keep inclusion and exclusion, but don't make them too easy to abuse -- Other syntactic options might also make sense: We should probably use an ID attribute instead of the name attribute in the above defining forms (to aid in cross-references, and the like).  </s>
<s> The Even with the fixed name, it doesn't look too bad: On the other hand, since attributes, content-models, tags, and attlists all havewe should perhaps allow multiple ID attributes per element, and vary the name of the attribute for the item being defined, to make DTD processing and cross-referencing with XML tools easier.  </s>
<s> I abandoned SGML technical terms for common parlance in the definition syntax.  </s>
<s> This could create some confusion for SGML geeks, but removes a significant barrier to initial understanding (and hence enthusiasm) for the HTML user in the street.  </s>
<s> The distinction between tag and element is useful, but can be pretty well approximated by "tag" and "tag and its contents."  </s>
<s> I think I went a bit too far in simplifying things, but if it would increase the user-base that would be a net gain.  </s>
<s> This contains just about everything I would want in a DTD language, in a syntax that I would prefer.  </s>
<s> I didn't include entity declaration syntax, but you can imagine.  </s>
<s> I would (of course) include a "new-character" declaration that give an entity name, and descriptive text, and would map to an SGML SDATA entity.  </s>
<s> Apologies for any infelicities or typos in the above, but I am in need of rest now.  </s>

<s> Many thanks to David, I like this!  </s>
<s> I can't say that I like the specific syntax that much, but the general idea of being able to simply declare element types and "attribute types" is very appealing.  </s>
<s> David has very succesfully reduced this to the point that a non-wizard like me can immediately see the value and merit.  </s>
<s> Frankly, I would not go so far on terminology, but I think that will be a matter of finding a common ground between the vocabularies of the SGML literati and the "great unwashed" -- to borrow an endearment from an unnamed technical committee.  </s>
<s> :-) Here, we have a meta-language in which one can declare element types and their content models, modify those content models by providing additional declarations (but without the hackery of parameter entities), and attach attributes to element types at will.  </s>
<s> This is fabulous!  </s>
<s> I don't really see the value in losing the "|" connector in expressing content models, but I guess that it does make things a bit simpler.  </s>
<s> The define-model element type is a handy shorthand that is, I assume, a useful replacement for parameter entities -- but much clearer.  </s>
<s> I agree that one should be able to declare that a given attribute or attribute list applies to a named/ID'd element type, but I also think that an element type declaration needs to be able to declare that an attribute or attribute list applies to itself.  </s>
<s> Finally...  </s>
<s> There have been numerous fragments of discussions that have suggested that it might be useful to have multiple IDs on a single SGML object -- an element, for most purposes.  </s>
<s> David has suggested the same again.  </s>
<s> I don't understand why this would be helpful.  </s>
<s> Is there some suggestion that an object's identity should be, somehow, context-sensitive?  </s>
<s> That addressing an object by one name means one thing, but that addressing it by another name might mean another thing?  </s>
<s> And if that is the issue, isn't it better to let the object have only one identity and to rely on other methods to assign aliases and to express additional layers of semantics?  </s>
<s> Help me with this -- I just don't get it.  </s>

<s> I didn't intend to lose it.  </s>
<s> (A problem with definition by example), but to show that if #PCDATA is only allowed in models like (#PCDATA | x | y | z)*, we might just a specail syntax for that case, nipping in the bud the obvious, but illegal, (#PCDATA, foo, #PCDATA, bar, bletch).  </s>
<s> By having "#PCDATA-containing" models have a special format, we elimiate a source of possible confusion.  </s>
<s> models like "(a|b)+, c" should still be allowed.  </s>
<s> We should remove SGML's funky paren rules as well, and go for a standard operator-precedence syntax.  </s>
<s> Pulling together adjacent like operators is easy to do for a computer, and a potential source of error for a user.  </s>
<s> I actually think we should keep parameter entities, but have built in notation to eliminate some of their idiomatic uses -- cases where by definition we are synthesizing useful abstractions that SGML lacks.  </s>
<s> yes. Incomplete again.  </s>
<s> Well, I didn't get it either.  </s>
<s> But I was thinking that in this case we have namespaces for elements, attributes, content models, and attribute lists, and unique IDs (_within_ each namespace).  </s>
<s> If we wanted to use the ID/IDREF mechanism to implement these references, however, we would have to add an extra parameter for the Unique_id, because there is only _one_ global namespace for ID and IDREF.  </s>
<s> So I can see the use for several namespaces, each with a parser-enforced uniqeness and reference semantics.  </s>
<s> This is not a must-have for me, but I now see why people would want it.  </s>
