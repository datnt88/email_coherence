<s> Sorry for the missing subject in my previous posting :-) On behalf of Martin Wallmer: Hi, should a DAV:allprop SEARCH on a Delta-V enabled resource return all Delta-V properties as well?  </s>
<s> According to RFC 3253 3.11 Additional PROPFIND Semantics A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the properties defined by this document.  </s>
<s> This allows a versioning server to perform efficiently when a naive client, which does not understand the cost of asking a server to compute all possible live properties, issues a DAV:allprop PROPFIND request.  </s>
<s> PROPFIND should not return them.  </s>
<s> Is this true for SEARCH as well?  </s>
<s> Is there a need to define the behaviour for SEARCH as well?  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin Wallmer Research &amp; Development Software AG  </s>
<s> I agree with Julian.  </s>
<s> DAV:allprop SEARCH should be defined to have the same behavior as DAV:allprop.  </s>
<s> In particular, it should not search RFC-3253 properties.  </s>
<s> The current proposal for the next revision of 2518 is that it should only search dead properties and properties defined in RFC-2518.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff I think we should make SEARCH compatible to RFC3253/ACL -- that is DAV:allprop behaves just like for PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> Wait-a-minute :-)  </s>
<s> Yes, it should SEARCH them (if used in the where clause).  </s>
<s> No, it shouldn't report them (when select uses allprop).  </s>
<s> sed s/search/report/  </s>
<s> I was assuming that you were referring to a DAV:allprop in the "WHERE" clause (i.e. find this string in all properties).  </s>
<s> Thus my statement that "DAV:allprop SEARCH should not search RFC-3253 properties".  </s>
<s> If you were referring to the use of DAV:allprop in the "SELECT" clause, then as Julian points out, it should not report RFC-3253 properties (but should search whatever is specified in the WHERE clause).  </s>
<s> And Julian's sed statement is of course correct (thanks, Julian!). Cheers, Geoff Wait-a-minute :-)  </s>
<s> Yes, it should SEARCH them (if used in the where clause).  </s>
<s> No, it shouldn't report them (when select uses allprop).  </s>
<s> sed s/search/report/  </s>
<s> Geoff, you can't have DAV:allprop in the where clause :-)  </s>
