<s> thread appeared (apparently not on HTTP-WG, but then I don't know how to find the original message).  </s>
<s> More particularly: I don't understand the conflict between the desire (on the part of at least one of you, apparently) to have an IANA "HTTP Headers Registry", and Larry's desire to see HTTP headers documented in IETF standards-track documents.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell from reading RFC 2434, there is no conflict; the document that creates an IANA registry normally specifies some sort of review mechanism, and one "suggested" wording is: Specification Required - Values and their meaning must be documented in an RFC or other permanent and readily available reference, in sufficient detail so that interoperability between independent implementations is possible.  </s>
<s> I agree that it would be Darned Good Idea to have an HTTP Headers Registry administered by IANA, because otherwise I suspect we will end up with a chaotic situation as more RFCs generate more header names.  </s>
<s> So I think it would be appropriate to create an "IANA Considerations" section (logically part of the HTTP specification, but presumably in a separate document) that says something like: IANA Considerations The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) administers the name space for HTTP header field-name values.  </s>
<s> Values and their meaning must be documented in an RFC, in sufficient detail so that interoperability between independent implementations is possible.  </s>
<s> Subject to these constraints, name assignments are First Come, First Served (see RFC2434).  </s>
<s> This registry initially consists of those header field-name values specified in RFC 2616, RFC 2617, [other RFCs TBD].  </s>
<s> Future RFCs that add values to this registry MUST provide an explicit list of such values in an "IANA Considerations" section, for the convenience of IANA in maintaining the registry.  </s>
<s> The list of "other RFCs" could be potentially fairly large, since there are a bunch of Experimental, Informational, or Proposed Standard RFCs listed on the HTTP-WG home page (in addition to the small set of Draft Standard RFCs).  </s>
<s> And, I suppose, some poor soul(s) would have to volunteer to help IANA glean the list of header names from all of these RFCs.  </s>
<s> But we might as well start now, rather than later.  </s>
<s> One more thing: I infer from the Subject line of this thread of messages that the intent is to create this registry as a section of the SOAP document.  </s>
<s> This is insane; it couples progress on establishing the registry to the progress of a much more complex technical design, and it hides the registry specification behind a title that most people would never suspect.  </s>
<s> (OK, how many people could guess the name of the RFC that defines the HTTP Status Code Registry, and no fair peeking at www.iana.org to find the back-pointer?) I'd suggest that we create a separate document called IANA Header Field-name Registry for HTTP that contains just the text above (and other necessary boilerplate) and be done with it.  </s>

<s> Jeff, The thread started here: I've been meaning to do this for some time.  </s>
<s> If there's support, I'll be glad to be the poor soul.  </s>
<s> I agree that it shouldn't be coupled with SOAP's other registrations (as it appears to make people in that WG equally nervous).  </s>

<s> This is IMHO rather about the fear that we get a HTTP Header Registry with numberous of useless headers, obstructing the creation of new useful headers.  </s>
<s> Using RFCs or a registry provides some advantages and disadvantages.  </s>
<s> The use of RFCs means that headers are generated with a useful description how they operate.  </s>
<s> It takes a lot of time for new headers to be documented, but I think this might be worth the effort, but only in some cases.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, creating a registry makes it possible to get a long list of mostly useless headers, you don't know where to use them for.  </s>
<s> If you want to set up a registry, ensure that you make some good RULES for adding headers to the list.  </s>
<s> Make sure the list doesn't get poluted: all the useless names.  </s>
<s> A domain name registries (e.g. the .nl  </s>
<s> domain) runs out of name-space, resulting in strange, stupid and funnie names.  </s>
<s> Even sentences without spaces are registered.  </s>
<s> Most companies just use there own headers for there products and I don't think they conflict with others.  </s>
<s> A registry ensures this doesn't happen.  </s>
<s> Some examples could be: - header names are reviewed.  </s>
<s> They must be supplied with a name and (generalized) description (of working).  </s>
<s> If agreed to the header, it's put on the list.  </s>
<s> - naming rules: add e.g. company or product name in the header General purpose headers must be published in RFCs, so others can use them.  </s>
<s> These don't follow the restrictions for the registry.  </s>
<s> I suppose you could  </s>
<s> combine both, in order to benefit from the little time needed to register a header on the registry and RFCs for general purpose headers, usable for multiple applications.  </s>
<s> This combines both strengths, but requires a registration policy... - Joris  </s>
<s> After reading your message several times, I *think* you agree that it would be a good idea to establish a registry, using the criterion that "Values and their meaning must be documented in an RFC." But you write: On the other hand, creating a registry makes it possible to get a long list of mostly useless headers, you don't know where to use them for.  </s>
<s> If you want to set up a registry, ensure that you make some good RULES for adding headers to the list.  </s>
<s> Make sure the list doesn't get poluted: all the useless names.  </s>
<s> My initial thought was that the requirement that the header name be documented in an RFC was a high enough standard to meet; the IESG has not been very generous about allowing Internet-Drafts to become RFCs.  </s>
<s> If a specification makes it to the RFC stage, then this suggests it has had enough review to be "somewhat useful" rather than "mostly useless."  </s>
<s> I suppose that a case could be made that the requirement should be stricter, e.g., "Values and their meaning must be documented in *standards-track, historic, or informational* RFC".  </s>
<s> That is, don't let experimental RFCs add things to the registry.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure about this, though.  </s>
<s> We might be micro-managing.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> I think that the requirement is not merely that the header is "useful" but that its interaction with the rest of HTTP has been analyzed and documented.  </s>
<s> Lots of header extensions are poorly considered and not interoperable as documented.  </s>
<s> The original motivation -- to allow "SOAPAction" as a HTTP header by putting it in a registry that would be established by the XML protocol group -- is pretty suspect.  </s>
<s> They don't need a "registry" to allow SOAPAction, they need to document how SOAPAction is used, what it means, and how to implement it interoperably.  </s>
<s> Is it end-to-end or hop-to-hop?  </s>
<s> Is it allowed  </s>
<s> in trailers as well as headers?  </s>
<s> Is it only allowed with requests, responses, only some methods or with all?  </s>
<s> How does it interact with other parts of HTTP semantics?  </s>
<s> So I think that "Values and their meaning must be documented in a RFC" is not adequate for HTTP headers.  </s>
<s> "Values and their meaning and interaction with the rest of HTTP must be reviewed in a standards-track update or extension to HTTP".  </s>
<s> Of course there are lots of headers and extensions that aren't documented in standards-track RFCs, but then those headers and extensions aren't standard.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, you'll see "Safe:" and "Accept-Additions:" in the header registry.  </s>
<s> I believe Mark is busy with other things right now, so I'll hazard a response.  </s>
<s> Definitely. IIRC, Mark's thinking was that we would do all that, *and* establish a registry for others to use.  </s>
<s> But I agree with the sentiment here that we only really need an index, not a registry.  </s>
<s> MB Mark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc. Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.  </s>
<s> mbaker@planetfred.com  </s>
<s> This points out that we should not use the word "useful", as it's exact meaning is merely 'undescribed'.  </s>
<s> What's the need of a registry is not to get conflicting headers and we want to prevent headers that don't work well with the current HTTP standard, what can be done more easily with RFCs.  </s>
<s> If new headers are defined and they are hop-to-hop, do the current proxies and gateways know about this?  </s>
<s> This is only in the case of extending currently existing hop-to-hop headers (like connection header).  </s>
<s> So setting up a registry must prevent 'poor headers' from appearing and headers being used by more than once with different meanings.  </s>
<s> When using RFCs, this is already ensured, but the two major complaints are that RFCs take a long time to be published and we don't want a list of RFCs that just handle HTTP extensions that are not meaningful to many applications (will not be implemented in most products).  </s>
<s> Most companies don't take the time needed to publish the RFC claiming there headers and giving a specification of it.  </s>
<s> So why a registry?  </s>
<s> - Fast registration of headers - No more (less?) conflicting headers (people register them) But why RFCs? - They will conform to the HTTP standard - Others will know how it interacts with HTTP I would like to (and will) end with note that using a registry doesn't mean we should not require a description of the header any more, it can also mean that we use the same procedure as RFCs, but that the 'registration time' is dramatically shortened.  </s>
<s> This ensure 'good headers' to be registered.  </s>
<s> Of course, already described headers cannot be overridden and must be kept.  </s>
<s> Others should be prevented from registering headers with these names.  </s>
<s> - Joris  </s>
<s> OK, so we all want to promote interoperability, right?  </s>
<s> But I am seeing a lot of disagreement in this thread about what rules for a HTTP header name registry would promote interoperability most.  </s>
<s> As far as I am concerned it is crazy to try to use an IETF registry to force some minimal level of documentation requirements on all HTTP headers.  </s>
<s> Implementing a new header is as simple as adding a line in a CGI script, and many people who have the need and ability to implement new headers will simply not care about getting formal IETF approval of their documentation, if they intend to publish documentation at all.  </s>
<s> It would be useful if somebody ran a service which helps everybody in picking new header names that nobody else is using yet.  </s>
<s> So in my opinion, the only way to maximally promote interoperability here is to have very low requirements for registration.  </s>
<s> In principle the *only* requirement for registering a header should be the honest intention to start using this header in internet HTTP-type traffic.  </s>
<s> Similar weak requirements already apply to the vendor mime type registry and the media feature tag registry.  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> Hmm. I don't know if it's good/possible to maintain a registry of *all* HTTP headers in use.  </s>
<s> The original intent was to assure coordination between headers that were standardised (or Recommended, etc.) by organisations like the IETF, W3C, OASIS, etc. to assure that there are no collisions, and to clarify the process.  </s>
<s> Imposing the requirement for these headers to be a reasonable fit into HTTP isn't such a bad thing, IMHO.  </s>
<s> Vendors, third parties, etc. would have three choices; 1) meet the requirements by publishing an RFC 2) use the HTTP Extension framework 3) take their chances.  </s>
<s> These are, of course, exactly the choices that they have today, except that #1 isn't well-defined.  </s>
<s> Mark Nottingham  </s>
<s> I don't think we are disagreeing in any unresolvable way.  </s>
<s> OK, so we all want to promote interoperability, right?  </s>
<s> But I am seeing a lot of disagreement in this thread about what rules for a HTTP header name registry would promote interoperability most.  </s>
<s> That's a good point.  </s>
<s> Promoting interoperability is certainly the primary objective.  </s>
<s> But I sense that a secondary objective (at least, among some people) is a desire to provide differentiation between "standard" and "non-standard" headers, since (as we saw in the proliferation of HTML tags) the creation of new IDs is not without potential negative consequences.  </s>
<s> (Mostly lack of interoperability, but sometimes more subtle than that.) As far as I am concerned it is crazy to try to use an IETF registry to force some minimal level of documentation requirements on all HTTP headers.  </s>
<s> Implementing a new header is as simple as adding a line in a CGI script, and many people who have the need and ability to implement new headers will simply not care about getting formal IETF approval of their documentation, if they intend to publish documentation at all.  </s>
<s> The value of having a registry that does require minimal documentation is that (1) it encourages documentation, for people who aren't entirely irresponsible, and (2) it allows us to define what "interoperability" means with respect to a given header name.  </s>
<s> Implementors who choose to add header names without going through this process are thus (implicitly, at least) accepting the risk of non-interoperability.  </s>
<s> That is, they have only themselves to blame if, later on, their software runs into interoperability bugs.  </s>
<s> The catch here is that, if an implementor widely deploys a system using a non-registered header, then this creates future problems for standards-track extensions which inadvertently choose the same It would be useful if somebody ran a service which helps everybody in picking new header names that nobody else is using yet.  </s>
<s> I agree with him.  </s>
<s> This suggests that the most effective approach (for maintaining interoperability) is the creation of TWO lists.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> An IANA registry of "Standardized HTTP Headers" that only includes headers described in standards-track documents, or the equivalent.  </s>
<s> (I would include "Best Current Practices" documents, since protocols such as HTTP/1.0 never entered the IETF Standards Track.) 2. An IANA registry of "Known non-standardized HTTP Headers."  </s>
<s> The purpose of this list would simply be to publicize the use (or intended use) of header names, so as to avoid collisions.  </s>
<s> As interoperability [this index should] have very low requirements for registration.  </s>
<s> In principle the *only* requirement for registering a header should be the honest intention to start using this header in internet HTTP-type traffic."  </s>
<s> RFC2434 explicitly allows this kind of FCFS registry.  </s>
<s> I hope this two-pronged approach satisfies everyone, since we end up with as much documentation as possible, without either unduly burdening people trying experiments or application-specific extensions, and without implying any approval of non-standards-track extensions.  </s>
