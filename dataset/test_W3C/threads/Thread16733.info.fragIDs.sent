<s> I believe the following three statements are true as of today's date (but I admit to a good deal of confusion over the second statement ). 1) All current Web-aware screen-readers (or Web page readers) expose "alt" text by default if it is present.  </s>

<s> 3) No current release of screen-reader (or Web page reader) exposes the "longdesc" URL.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate hearing from users or developers who could confirm, deny or refine these statements.  </s>

<s> At least with JAWS, it's the other way around, i.e. JAWS will read the "alt" only if the "title" is not also present (including the "title" of an a which contains the image).  </s>
