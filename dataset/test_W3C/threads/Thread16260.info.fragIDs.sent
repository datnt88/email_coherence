<s> Hello, Joe Clarke wrote the message below on CHI-WEB, and summarised the views of many us agains drop-down navigation boxes.  </s>
<s> There is a further aspect, accessibility, about which the WAI guidelines appears silent.  </s>
<s> This may be because "they require Java" (does he mean JavaScript?), but another message in this thread points out that they are in DHTML and likely to be by W3C for a future HTML.  </s>
<s> (I'll forward that message separately.) If it is true, it is bad news for accessibility, and you WAI people should put a stop to it.  </s>

<s> Subject: Drop-down navigation boxes - button or no button?  </s>
<s> I have used drop down boxes and find they can be quite useful... (puts all your choices on one screen without scrolling) we also give the user a choice of a numerical listing, alphabetical listing and a topical listing... (Users indicated that they liked it)  </s>
<s> Reasons not to use them at all: 1. Options are hidden.  </s>
<s> Options should not be hidden, according to many people.  </s>
<s> (The use of "hidden information spaces"-- submenus that appear only when you mouseover a button-- is contentious.  </s>
<s> It works in many cases but is nonobvious and requires Java.  </s>
<s> See Aquent discussion in my analysis of job-site usability, http://www.electricseed.com/joeclark/jobsites.html .) 2. There is a temptation to load up the menu with too many options.  </s>
<s> Common example: U.S. state names.  </s>
<s> (A bad idea anyway-- what if your address does not fit that format?  </s>
<s> Alberta and Queensland aren't U.S. states.)  </s>
<s> You also see this with country names, which guarantees you ~150 entries.  </s>
<s> Worst example I ever saw: http://www.imiward.com/cgi-local/pjward/Catalogue.cgi , whose search-for-jobs feature insists that you select your specialty from a menu of over 200 options (in mixed case, many of which also have mysterious codes).  </s>
<s> 3. Current UIs for scrolling lists are poor: They insist you scroll.  </s>
<s> Windows does this a bit better, actually, since the list stays up after one click; otherwise you have to hold the mouse down, which is fatiguing.  </s>
<s> Many newbies do not know how to scroll beyond the bottom of the screen in such a listing.  </s>
<s> Lynx can optionally number the entries in a pull-down menu; why can't IE and Explorer?  </s>
<s> (Indeed, a member of the Microsoft accessibility team dismissed numbering links as trivial, as though an easy-to-program feature were worthless.) 4. They're too "neato" in programmer terms.  </s>
<s> In other words, programmers think they're highly efficient and kewel.  </s>
<s> If anything were the antithesis of usability, that is.  </s>

<s> Hi, This question came up recently in the BBC - I thought I'd answered correctly, and would like to double check I'm right, since I am no longer wholly sure.  </s>
<s> I have been operating with the idea that no form element in HTML is in itself a problem, it's just a question of creating the form in such a way as to be navigable with the keys only.  </s>
<s> Is that right?  </s>
<s> Or should I get back to my colleague and tell them no, avoid drop-down boxes.  </s>
<s> BTW, in case anyone was confused by the misinfo, drop-down navigation boxes in HTML require neither Java nor Java script - a server side CGI script (about three lines of Perl, maybe more in other languages), can provide a drop-down box handler that will function identically regardless of the calling browser, and will also remove the temptation (or indeed ability) to implement something that lacks a 'Do The Thing I Just Asked You To' button and acts as soon as thing selected in the drop-down is selected.  </s>

<s> As I understand it they are fine in english, but casue a problem in TIFLOWIN, a common spanish screen reader (because it is cheap, so widely used, but hangs when the screen changes).  </s>
<s> Interestingly, one of the options Lynx provides is to render drop-down boxes as checkbuttons instead - there must be a reason why this seemed desirable.  </s>
<s> I am interested in knowing if they are still a problem, so if anyone has up-to-date information it would be nice to find out.  </s>

<s> aloha, charles!  </s>
<s> on the WAI-IG list, you observed: quote Interestingly, one of the options Lynx provides is to render drop-down boxes as checkbuttons instead - there must be a reason why this seemed desirable.  </s>
<s> unquote this ability to convert select option form controls into radio buttons was added to Lynx specifically to accommodate blind users... here is a (hopefully) brief historical overview which explains the problems that popup menu support, as originally implemented in Lynx, caused, and why the radio button transformation option was added to Lynx: when running Lynx with the SHOW_CURSOR setting active, older versions of Lynx placed the cursor at the extreme right of the popup menu it generated when the user navigated to a SELECT OPTION form control... thus, the use of popup menus in conjunction with a screen-reader often made listening to the form extremely difficult -- not to mention downright annoying -- for, with the cursor placed at the end of the select option text, the only way to expose the content of the option was to use your screen-reader's "say-line" command, which, of course, led to bleed-through of text from the underlying page content... as a compensatory measure, the Lynx Developmental Consortium built the toggle mechanism into Lynx, so that the user could decide whether to have Lynx render the options contained in the select menu either as a popup box or to render each option as a radio button... and for (what was then state-of-the-art) accessibility's sake, each radio button was placed on a separate line... so, why precisely was the ability to convert select option menus into a series of radio buttons added to Lynx? mainly because those actually doing the programming argued that it would take considerably more programming time and effort to move the cursor from the extreme right of the popup menu box (i.e. after the last character in the option), to the extreme left of the popup menu box (which is to say, on the first character of the first option in the select option menu -- a placement which would allow screen readers to speak the selected option ONLY when the user navigated the option list with the arrow keys) anyway, to nip a burgeoning epic in the bud, thankfully, wayne buttles -- the man behind bobcat and lynx32 -- was willing to take the time to effect the change in bobcat and lynx32, which eventually led the Lynx-Developmental consortium to do the same... it should also be noted that, when the MULTIPLE attribute is defined for the SELECT element, Lynx has always converted popup menus into checkboxes... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.
