<s> has anyone tried to use http over udp.  </s>
<s> i have a device which has only udp type server sockets.  </s>
<s> it doenst have TCP ones.  </s>
<s> I want to reach that device using netscape/ IE (any browser).  </s>
<s> since HTTP is based over TCP , my UDP listener at my device's end wont receive packets sent over netscape.  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>

<s> The issue is that HTTP needs a connection-oriented transport.  </s>
<s> Using UDP would mean that you need some sort of connection-management...  </s>
<s> So why use UDP?  </s>
<s> Note that UDP is a complete different protocol than TCP, even if they have the same range of port numbers (and have ports).  </s>

<s> A few people have investigated the use of HTTP over UDP rather than TCP, useful for short files as a way of bypassing TCP startup overheads.  </s>
<s> The most recent such work of which I'm aware was in the last Infocom.  </s>
<s> See Fred  </s>
<s> Hi Joris,  </s>
<s> I have a device that supports only UDP kind of server side sockets.  </s>
<s> So I have to use UDP.  </s>
<s> Yes, I know , but since I had to use UDP, I was thinking on that track Tapan  </s>

<s> Quite a late response, but I didn't have time earlier...  </s>
<s> The issue is that you need some kind of session-management for the 'requests'.  </s>
<s> Having this solves requests over UDP greater than  </s>
<s> 64KB and such  </s>
<s> transmission back.  </s>
<s> Also, the client needs to know what it's  </s>
<s> requests are.  </s>
<s> This is required in the case of multiple requests.  </s>
<s> Im quite new as far as working of HTTP protocol is concerned.. Could you pl. tell me more about the session mgmt protocol here?  </s>
<s> Is 64kb is a bottleneck for the UDP requests?  </s>
<s> Depends on what you want.  </s>
<s> Relatively small HTML pages, some art and stuff usually keep below 64kb, but there are pages that are way larger, and this is even more common for art.  </s>
<s> Not to talk about downloads or IE's extensions, like ActiveX Controls  </s>
<s> The proposal on the ATT research site, still relies on TCP, however: connections are made by the server rather than the client.  </s>
<s> So  </s>
<s> STILL TCP!!!  </s>
<s> not solely UDP.  </s>
<s> A nice feature would be the easy implementation of HOL  </s>
<s> blocking / async  </s>
<s> transfers of all files.  </s>
<s> Could you please elaborate more on this?  </s>
<s> HOL blocking stands for Head-Of-Line Blocking: meaning if you send two requests (using one connection-persistent connection) using TCP, one for a large PDF file and another for a small image file, then first the large PDF file must be downloaded before you can get the image.  </s>
<s> If you send the image first and then the PDF file, this would be much nicer in some instances.  </s>
<s> Also it's nice for transports that can have packet  </s>
<s> drops: live audio/video.  </s>
<s> But for this there are other  </s>
<s> protocols that do  </s>
<s> better than HTTP.  </s>
<s> Which protocols other than HTTP would you consider better here?  </s>
<s> TCP?  </s>
<s> No, MMS (Microsoft), RTSP (Apple Quicktime, Realplayer).  </s>
<s> These are designed solely for audio/video and work on UDP/TCP and support multicast.  </s>
<s> I hope you understand how IP, UDP, TCP, HTTP, ..... are related to eachother... IP is designed for addressing computers and routing requests easily.  </s>
<s> TCP is a connection-based reliable protocol that works on top of IP. UDP is a connection-less unreliable datagram protocol that works on top of IP. HTTP is a application protocol that usually works on top of TCP.  </s>
<s> Next you need enourmes time-outs, since you don't know  </s>
<s> whether a server is  </s>
<s> still handling your request or crashed or 'bobby' knows what else...  </s>
