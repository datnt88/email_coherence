<s> A technique for ensuring that multimedia embedded in a page degrades gracefully.  </s>
<s> Use the EMBED proprietary element within the content of an OBJECT, and associated with aprropriate descriptive text.  </s>
<s> Note that EMBED is not a W3C-recognised element, and that there is no mechanism to associate ALT text with it directly (CMcCN:: Can someone with NS3 or IE or something check this?).  </s>
<s> Therefore this technique is only useful to solve a legacy problem.  </s>
<s> Use of EMBED in other manners actually creates an accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> Charles  </s>
<s> Thus, Charles' proposed kludge amounts to the following: object data="symphony.au"  </s>
<s> Mahler's first symphony embed [attribute referring to symphony.au]  </s>
<s> /object Whereas, a standard-compliant solution would use an anchor element instead of EMBED: a href="symphony.au"  </s>
<s> Listen to Mahler's first symphony /a within the content of OBJECT.  </s>
<s> Of course, some functionality is lost, but the result is not overly inconvenient for the reader and maintains conformity with the HTML specification.  </s>
<s> The legacy will, of course, disappear as users upgrade their software.  </s>
<s> That's about the size of it.  </s>
<s> I think it will be used a lot (EMBED is used a lot) for movies and audio to be included within a page instead of seperately - it's one of those things that I suspect designers are VERY reluctant to give up.  </s>
<s> So I think that offering a good kludge which provides an accessible result is better than leaving people to do as they will.  </s>
<s> Actually it would be worth suggesting that they also include a link to the object in the standard (A HREF) way.  </s>
