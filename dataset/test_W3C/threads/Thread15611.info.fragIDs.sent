<s> I didn't find this particular article all that insightful.  </s>
<s> Lee's comment is a good one, and missed entirely by the article's author.  </s>
<s> It might possibly apply to a site that has but one single goal process, but few of those creatures exist.  </s>
<s> Even a site that sells nothing but clothing has a more complex process than just "I want to buy a size 3 shoe."  </s>
<s> What about the user who wants to contact the company, apply for a job, find out something about them, find out their policies, or take a look at that nice sweater on the home page?  </s>
<s> Do users care where they are on a web site?  </s>
<s> Usually, no, they don't.  </s>
<s> Might they want to find their way back to a number of other parts of the site?  </s>
<s> Yes, they do.  </s>
<s> Bread crumb navigation isn't just to show off the information's hierarchy, it's also to show how to find your way back the way you came.  </s>
