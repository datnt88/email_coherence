<s> Hi, I wonder wether there is a way to get a list of versions (of different version histories) having the same label?  </s>

<s> The short answer is "no" (at least, not with a single request).  </s>
<s> There was a thread on this topic not too long ago, and the result was a disagreement about whether or not a PROPFIND Depth:Infinity with a Label header would get this for you or not.  </s>
<s> The answer is probably "in general, not", because at least some  </s>
<s> implementors will not be supporting this.  </s>
<s> I've proposed adding a DAV:get-labeled-version REPORT, which could be used with a Depth:Infinity header to do what you want here, but that is not in the current version of the spec, so that doesn't do you any good for right now.  </s>
<s> I'll try to get that spec'ed out and posted to the group in a couple of weeks, so that there is something out there for us to start discussing and folks to start playing with if they badly need this functionality.  </s>

<s> I kind of skimed through this thread.  </s>
<s> I think the report would be the better way of doing it.  </s>
