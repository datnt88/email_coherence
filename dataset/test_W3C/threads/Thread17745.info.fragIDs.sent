<s> We are an association in France called FIDEV (Formation et Insertion pour D?ficients Visuels) that means Training and Integration for the visually impaired.  </s>
<s> Our purpose is to improve the professional integration of the blind and visually impaired persons.  </s>
<s> Also, the accessibility of the web is our preocupation, that's why we met a few months ago Daniel Dardailler.  </s>
<s> We are happy today to participate to this kind of work.  </s>
<s> About this guideline, we can say several things : - the document is clear, and the structure of the document works well ;  </s>
<s> - clear, but does every user agent manufacturer understand the stake of every recommendation, that means that every user agent manufacturer knows the customized equipment (terminal braille, voice synthetizer...) used by blind people or visually impaired ?  </s>
<s> - we have to insist on the very important fact that the navigation must be possible through the keyboard, and only the keyboard ;  </s>
<s> - the links : very often, it is possible to navigate from link to link.  </s>
<s> But, when you read a text, according to the terminal braille or the voice synthetizer used, the link will be not identified as a link.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it is necessary to precise it in front of the link.  </s>
<s> Exemple : [LINK]Fidev That is also true about a image, when this image is also a link.  </s>
<s> Some remarks important.  </s>
<s> We still continue our investigation : the state of the art of the customized equipment.  </s>

<s> We already say that UA should support the ":before" pseudo element of CSS2, and if they do, then users can declare a client-side CSS such as: A:before { content: "[LINK]" } which would give you what you want.  </s>

<s> 5.4 and 5.5: Why specifically KEYBOARD navigation?  </s>
<s> I agree of course on the capital importance of this, but in the spirit of 3.6 device-independent manner... maybe you should reword and say just "navigation", and later stressed that it is "including keyboard navigation".  </s>
<s> Consider the case of a hands-free voice-controlled browser.  </s>
<s> FIDEV explains why.  </s>
<s> I'll add that voice will not work for some people or in noisy evolvements.  </s>
<s> The keyboard is so basic it is often ignored as a great way to get work done.  </s>
<s> It is the input device most likely to be on most systems.  </s>
<s> Interesting reading: Keyboard Power by David Berlind Regards, Bryan - "Its been said the pebbles can't stop the avalanche, guess the pebbles didn't have access to the Web!"  </s>
