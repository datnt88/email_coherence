<s> I am trying to test my pages on as many browsers as possible.  </s>
<s> Since it now  </s>
<s> appears that more than half of all surfers on-line are connecting through  </s>
<s> AOL (sigh), I need to be able to test my pages in AOL's browser.  </s>
<s> I went to aol.com and downloaded the latest browser, but there doesn't seem to be any way to use it without signing up for AOL.  </s>
<s> Also, there doesn't seem to be a developer's site, or, in fact, any information at all to make my life  </s>
<s> easier.  </s>
<s> Interestingly, I tested the browser on local files and it seems to be using MSIE to do it's Internet browsing.  </s>
<s> Could it be that making pages work in IE will cover AOL also?  </s>
<s> Seems to good to be true.  </s>
<s> Besides, my parents have AOL and they are always reporting problems with my sites.  </s>
<s> I test with everything from Lynx to Opera to pwWebspeak and Mosaic, and I can never duplicate the problems they report (then again, I'm on a PC and they're on a Mac, so anything's possible).  </s>
<s> Would really like my pages to be accessible to everyone.  </s>
<s> Anyone know how to test in AOL without signing up?  </s>
<s> Also, are there any other browsers I can pick up (freely or very cheaply, please...  </s>
<s> I'm not rich) that others recommend?  </s>
<s> I am particularly interested in screen readers, but they all seem quite expensive.  </s>
<s> Also, anything I download must work on Win95 (so emacspeak  </s>
<s> is out).  </s>
<s> Kynn, you seem to be an expert on browsers.  </s>
<s> What say you?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I currently have the following: MSIE 5.0 beta2 Netscape 4.5, 4.07, 4.05, 3.4, 3.1, 2.02  </s>
<s> Mosaic 3.0 Lynx 2.8 pwWebspeak 2.0 Opera 3.5 WebTV viewer AOL 4.0???  </s>
<s> Also, any ideas for how to get around Bill Gates' dictum that thou shalt only have one copy of IE on your system?  </s>
<s> Short of a dual boot, that is.  </s>

<s> Charles, I was running into the same problems.  </s>
<s> It became a major concern when I discovered that a client I designed a site for was using AOL as their primary browser and I hadn't tested under AOL.  </s>
<s> What I found worked well for simulating the same appearance as the AOL Browser was Browserola using the HTML 3.0 test feature.  </s>
<s> I am also now including an AOL detection script on my sites and giving those users a page which explains how to use the Standard versions of either IE or Netscape instead of the proprietary one built into AOL.  </s>
<s> Other than that I also have not found anything that simulates the AOL default browser, though CODA, the maker of Browserola, claims that their next version will add this feature.  </s>
