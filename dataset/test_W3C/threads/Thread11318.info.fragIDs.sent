<s> I.e. none between U+2000 to U+200B, and U+2010 to U+2FFF.  </s>

<s> I can't decode all the numbers given for the name start characters, but from the comments below, it looks like you've added _ and : to name characters but not namestart characters.  </s>
<s> Now this is precisely what I want, but my understanding was that the ERB decided to add _ and : to namestart characters too.  </s>
<s> (Why?  </s>
<s> I see no reason to want to add _ or : to namestart characters, and it just so happens some tools [e.g., Adept] make use of an initial _ character  </s>
<s> to denote internally reserved names, so at least for the present, we will not be allowing _ as a namestart character.) I'd be pleased to hear I'm wrong and _ and : are NOT allowable namestart characters, but I wonder if someone can confirm the current decision.  </s>

<s> I automatically didn't add _ as a namestart, because of Adept tools :-) And I think it is premature to add ":" as a namestart, because then people will use it with some namespace minimization conventions in mind.  </s>
<s> I think that the only namespace convention that people should use at the moment is ISO 9070 style "::" qualifiers with no name minimisation: so ::table would not be valid, but "HTML::table" and "SO::CALS::table" would be.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, apart from Bert Bos's comments on case, this SGML declaration is relatively free from contraversiality, if you buy into native language markup in the first place.  </s>
<s> In the only area that is contraversial (spaces as SEPCHARS) we can always relax the rules if they are found unworkable (Gavin :-).  </s>
<s> I have put the extra characters into a convenient position to allow people to uncomment them and make them SEPCHARS for the purpose of getting a parsing document to allow corrections.  </s>
<s> And I put in a recommendation that naughty types of spaces are a validity error, rather than a WFness error.  </s>

<s> XML-lang, as deliverable in July, will not have namespaces.  </s>
<s> So we should avoid trouble and prevent incompatible namespace dialects emerging.  </s>
<s> If the IG and WG8 come up with a good system that requires it, then ":" can be moved up to be a namestart character, but for now all we need, I think, is the simplest of naming conventions "::" to keep names of exportable elements in DTDs unique.  </s>

<s> Remember that numbers in the SGML declaration are restricted to 8 digits (because the SGML declaration uses the reference concrete syntax), so there is no way legally in SGML to declare UCS-4 as the document character set.  </s>
