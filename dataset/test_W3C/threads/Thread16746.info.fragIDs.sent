<s> My recent studies show an ignorance of accessibility and usability in most published books addressing preparation of materials for the internet.  </s>
<s> These affect the means for learning about or training for web accessibility and usability.  </s>
<s> See: www.tiac.net/users/bingham/accessbl/softpro.htm 15946 bytes (covered in 39, ignored in 314 of 353 from Softpro Books) www.tiac.net/users/bingham/accessbl/quantum.htm 6744 bytes (covered in 10, ignored in 128 of 138 from Quantum Books) I propose these results justify a significant education and outreach task.  </s>

<s> Skimming most such books shows a general ignorance of the web standards in general.  </s>
<s> They tend to be collections of things that empirically "work" on tbe big two browsers.  </s>
<s> Also, as commercial books, they tell their readers what they want to know, not what they ought to know.  </s>
<s> On this second point, there is probably no value in trying to reach the authors; they will probably take the standard commercial position, as recently taken by Chris Wilson on the www-html mailing list, that commercial organisations only have a responsibility to meet their customer demands, not the public good.  </s>
<s> You have to change the customer demands, which will be more difficult.  </s>
<s> You probably have to write your own books which meet those demands better than the existing books.  </s>

<s> An informal sampling of mailing list postings shows that an increasing proportion of mailing list authors are ignorant of the fact that their mail programs include travesties of HTML bloating the size of their article without including any extra information.  </s>
<s> May I add the following from personal experience: I wrote an eBook in 1998/9 on HTML, CSS, XHTML with reference to WAI and strictly following the W3C recommendations.  </s>
<s> The eBook is used successfully in training - both private colleges and university.  </s>
<s> When I contacted publishers for a paper-based version, nobody was interested.  </s>
<s> The eBook is still available - although it now needs a good revision.  </s>
<s> It consists of more than 800 HTML files with about 50'000 links, with hundreds of examples of what is supposed to happen as opposed to what does happen (ie browser interpretation).  </s>

<s> I did some editing of a couple of chapters for a book called "How to Program in XML" or something like that.  </s>
<s> Although it didn't have accessibility as the overriding concern they were interested in comments on it (specifically requested it) and a number of accessibility things did get included.  </s>
<s> (I was looking at the chapters on CSS and HTML - I don't know how much got into the later stuff on XML).  </s>
<s> I know that other ublishers have approached accessibility people looking for at least a bit of accessibility review.  </s>

<s> I tech edited an XHTML book last year and the author was very interested in issues of accessibility, and was glad each time I pointed out a snippet of code where the img tag lacked alt attributes.  </s>
<s> I don't think it's as dismal a situation as many people think, and I believe that most authors _are_ receptive of accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> The idea that they will all be mercenary and say "we only do what is commercially viable" is far too cynical; most web book authors are _not_ commercial web mercenaries, but are rather semi-jaded idealists who like to learn, teach, and write.  </s>
<s> My point is that they are our allies, not our enemies.  </s>
<s> I will see what I can do about following up on my contacts within those communities and raising awareness of accessibility issues.  </s>
