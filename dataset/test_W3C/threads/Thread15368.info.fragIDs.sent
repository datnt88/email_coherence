<s> Not to be trite, but it appears to me that if an author wants to invoke personal preference that they simply not conform to WCAG.  </s>
<s> To be even more trite, the author may state "This site does not conform to WCAG because the author feels artistic freedom is more important than accessibility."  </s>

<s> My argument is that we should, as much as possible, provide a way for authors to override our guidelines as long as they notify the audience.  </s>
<s> Example 1:  </s>
<s> Guidelines say there must be good text/background contrast.  </s>
<s> Author uses yellow text on white background and states "I want this text to be difficult to read because of some artistic reason ". Example 2:  </s>
<s> Guidelines say there should be clear navigation.  </s>
<s> Author has porously confusing navigation and states "Navigation is confusing because I want you to wander around."  </s>
<s> Example 3: Guidelines say content should be understandable.  </s>
<s> Author creates easily misunderstood content and states "I am an anarchist - deal with it."  </s>
<s> Regarding the TH rule: If you really want to have THs in your layout table then you can.  </s>
<s> Just explicitly state that this is a layout table.  </s>

<s> That sounds that blanket -- when creating Web sites, I observe several things to be arranged.  </s>

<s> Sometimes there might be reasons to develop not the entire way the WCAG suggests, but this is not inevitably wrong (or inaccessible).  </s>
<s> So there is no need to judge all people by ridiculing 'artistic freedom'.  </s>

<s> The question is whether or not the guidelines provide a normative conformance scheme (as WCAG 1.0 does) or if they provide specific sample conformance schemes (which can be structured to parallel WCAG 1.0 A/AA/AAA if desired) as examples of using WCAG 2.0 as a toolkit for building accessibility policies.  </s>
<s> I have long advocated the latter approach.  </s>
<s> The process of developing an accessibility policy is very different from the process of creating an accessible Web site.  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 should be a toolkit for doing so, in a way that is interoperable and standardized, to prevent situations like the case of Section 508.  </s>
<s> (In other words, you should be able to "build" a policy approximating 508 by selecting portions of WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> This will likely be much different from the "default" conformance schemes.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://kynn.com  </s>
