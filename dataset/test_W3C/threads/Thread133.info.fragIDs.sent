<s> It would be great if Tidy gave an option to write JavaScript and CSS to an external file, but this would involve QUITE SOME additional work... Such a feature would not make much sense without the ability to parse (and tidy) entire directory trees (that is: to tidy an entire project at one run, putting JavaScript functions and CSS style rules into each one external file)... Lots of work, but certainly worth consideration!  </s>
