<s> I have made a rough first draft of the Braille CSS requirements document available at http://rvib2.rvib.org.au/%7ewhiteja/brlcss.html  </s>
<s> This is really a discussion paper; it analyses issues and suggests solutions, but does not give firm recommendations.  </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate it if members of the WAI WG would read the document and subject  </s>
<s> it to a thorough and rigorous critique.  </s>
<s> I would also like to arrange for it to be read by braille experts and others who are interested in this area.  </s>
<s> All comments should be sent to the WAI WG list in order to promote further discussion.  </s>
<s> Thanks Jason, I've updated the Action items page and made a local copy on the W3C site for faster access.  </s>
<s> If subscribers to this list feel like they know braille experts or that they are braille experts themselves, please take some time to review Jason's document and report back to us.  </s>
<s> My main intention in making this draft available is to have it circulating prior to the WAI technical meeting, which regrettably I will not be in a position to attend.  </s>
<s> The document was written and edited in rather a hurry, and a few minor spelling and grammatical errors have crept in, but these should not be of significant concern.  </s>
<s> All comments and criticisms are welcome, and as Daniel suggested, please forward the document to anyone who would be interested in reviewing it.  </s>
