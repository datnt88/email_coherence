<s> We might look at the ideas for cognitive access as falling into three categories.  </s>
<s> Type C1) Those that can be added to a page without changing the look or feel of the page at all.  </s>
<s> (Many/most of the guidelines for other disabilities fall into this category.  </s>
<s> Do we have any for cognitive that we don't already have included?  </s>
<s> ?Like making text with real text so that it can read aloud for a user) Type C2) Those that could be added to a page without anyone thinking the page was different from standard web pages (except that it was better designed).  </s>
<s> (These would include such things as using the most straightforward and simple words that are appropriate for the site.  </s>
<s> Or including graphics strategically on the page to help navigation or understanding - but not so much that it would not look like a page for mass audiences.  </s>
<s> Type C3) Those that would make a page more accessible to people with cognitive disabilities but would involve major changes to the look and feel that might make the page less appealing to mass audiences.  </s>
<s> (These would be used on pages that are specifically tuned to people with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> Having a page which is primarily graphic or which has not ideas expressed in text that are not also expressed graphically would be examples here) At times I think we seem to be switching back and forth between the three in a discussion and treating them all as equivalent.  </s>
<s> I think that they are quite different in terms of where they can be applied and what we can or should mandate.  </s>

<s> One of the main purposes of CSS is to help in the "noble quest" of maintaining "content" as a separate entity and regarding structure and presentation as *largely* visualisation tools.  </s>
<s> The idea is that the textual content is some lowest level of linguistic abstraction of whatever it is that is to be communicated.  </s>
<s> Just putting this content into words is the semantic level that we so often wrongly think of as *direct* - almost not abstract, but of course this is not the case, hence the notion of "clear and simple" that we call for but cannot really define.  </s>
<s> All language is "foreign" to that which is to be expressed as we so clearly realize when we try to talk to other species or very young members of our own or those who are clueless in our particular language.  </s>
<s> If we are to make much of the Web accessible to (usable by?) people with differences we must take into account the nature of those differences and this is not a frequent part of most of our daily experience.  </s>
<s> "Cognitive Impairment" attempts to codify something without clear boundaries.  </s>
<s> Compared to genius, all others are impaired; compared to "core vocabulary" (something under 1000 words) all language is too complex.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we can work towards making things clearer with practice in "translating" stuff into something like Basic English without putting everything into Pidgin?  </s>
<s> Perhaps we can...? Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Very good observation Marti.  </s>
<s> Hmmmm.  </s>
<s> Browsers that read are one type of Assistive Tech.  </s>
<s> They help people who can understand language but not read it.  </s>
<s> Are there "simplification" programs?  </s>
<s> Things that take complex language and re-present it more simply?  </s>
<s> Clearly this would eliminate some of the information, but captions (for the deaf) eliminate some information from speech and descriptions eliminate some from pictures.  </s>

<s> Marti, CAST has been working on TTS for learners, including those with LD, for many years.  </s>
<s> Our eReader demo can be downloaded from and used freely for 2 weeks or 10 sessions.  </s>
<s> This is a 10MB download so it's good to have a fast connection.  </s>
<s> I suspect that you have a cable modem.  </s>
<s> I mention this only to indicate that attention to TTS with navigation controls and synchronized highlighting of text spoken in Rich Text documents or in the Internet Explorer component inside the eReader application can support struggling readers while traversing frames and tables.  </s>
<s> We also created special Windows and Mac versions for Houghton Mifflin Social Studies CD-ROMs for use in California.  </s>
<s> As long as the text content is RTF or HTML, there is no problem reading it with TTS.  </s>
<s> I should note that we feel that it is critical for the text to highlight while it is spoken for this population.  </s>
<s> It encourages following along and in our ongoing research, we have found that in time, some students turn off the TTS and use highlighting to pace their reading.  </s>
<s> This is not a sales pitch.  </s>
<s> I just want you to know that this exists.  </s>
<s> In fact, if you have a use for it and can provide feedback about how to make it better, I'll make sure you get it for free.  </s>
<s> There are issues pertaining to page content authoring that are important for this type of tool to work well and the WAI Guidelines provide a terrific baseline.  </s>
<s> We do want TTS to work in complex media-rich Web-based environments and we are getting there.  </s>
