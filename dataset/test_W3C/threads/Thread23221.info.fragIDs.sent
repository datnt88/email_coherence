<s> Apologies for the nitpicks, but since the DOM Level 3 will likely become a Recommendation, may as well be precise.  </s>
<s> In http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/introduction.html is the following Note: "Note: OMG IDL is used only as a language-independent and implementation- neutral way to specify interfaces.  </s>
<s> Various other IDLs could have been used ([COM], [Java IDL], [MIDL], ...).  </s>
<s> In general, IDLs are designed for specific computing environments.  </s>
<s> The Document Object Model can be implemented in any computing environment, and does not require the object binding runtimes generally associated with such IDLs."  </s>
<s> The same language is in the DOM Level 2 Core (http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM- Level-2-Core/introduction.html).  </s>
<s> Proposal #1:  </s>
<s> Replace the second sentence of the Note ("Various other IDLs could have been used ([COM], [Java IDL], [MIDL], ...).") with: "Other IDLs such as [MIDL] could have been used."  </s>
<s> Delete the Java IDL entry from I.2 ("Informative References").  </s>
<s> Delete the COM entry from I.2 ("Informative References").  </s>
<s> Rationale #1: Java IDL is not a different IDL than OMG IDL.  </s>
<s> JavaIDL is Sun's *implementation* of a CORBA-compliant ORB that is compatible with some level of OMG IDL.  </s>
<s> COM is arguably not itself an IDL.  </s>
<s> MIDL is the IDL used in COM, and MIDL is mentioned elsewhere in the note.  </s>
<s> Proposal #2: In I.2 ("Informative References"), the URL given for MIDL no longer works.  </s>
<s> I propose replacing it with one that does.  </s>

<s> Comment: If there's a need to list more than one alternative IDL, there are others.  </s>
<s> ONC RPC and DCE RPC come to mind, though these are not completely object- oriented.  </s>

<s> ... except that while MSFT's IDL (used with COM) was designed for a particular computing environment (C/C++ oriented, look at it in detail), that was explicitly a non-goal of OMG-IDL.  </s>
<s> In fact one of its design goals (one that was achieved!) was getting past some of those kinds of problems with DCE-IDL (from which MSFT borrowed heavily, ISTR :). It'd be worth saying that of the object-oriented IDLs in wide use at the time that DOM Level 1 was specified , OMG-IDL was the least bound to a specific computing environment.  </s>

<s> Better solution: "Many other IDLs exist which could have been used."  </s>
