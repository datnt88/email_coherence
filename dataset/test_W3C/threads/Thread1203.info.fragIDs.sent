<s> Martin is completely correct on the first count: I sent the message to the wrong list.  </s>
<s> Here's the recent announcement for the new draft.  </s>
<s> We think this draft covers all the issues discussed here since the last draft.  </s>
<s> On first reading, I agree with some of Martin's nits, but need to look more  </s>
<s> carefully at the substantial stuff.  </s>
<s> However, please do read the draft and let us know if you think it is ready (or almost ready) to be sent off for RFChood.  </s>

<s> Title : UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646 Author(s) : P. Hoffman, F. Yergeau Filename : draft-hoffman-utf16-03.txt Pages : 9 Date : 20-Apr-99 This document describes the UTF-16 encoding of Unicode/ISO-10646 and contains the registration for three MIME charset parameter values: UTF-16BE (big-endian), UTF-16LE (little-endian), and UTF-16.  </s>

<s> To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command.  </s>
<s> To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader.  </s>
<s> Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages.  </s>
<s> Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft.  </s>

<s> Before this goes to last call, I just wanted to say that permitting multiple byte orderings in this context has a high probability of leading to interoperability problems similar to past problems caused by permitting multiple endian orders in a protocol.  </s>
<s> My intention with this comment is simply to make my technical assessment clear.  </s>
<s> I see little value in pushing this issue or making a last call comment because: (1) This issue has been debated to death alrady.  </s>
<s> (2) There is a lot of "religion" involved in the issue and further debate will likely not help.  </s>
<s> (3) I know this was agreed to by the Unicore group which is a smart group that knows more about character sets than I do.  </s>
<s> (4) If UTF-16 has interoperability problems, it will just strengthen support for UTF-8 and RFC 2277.  </s>
<s> Since I think UTF-8 is a better solution in most cases anyway, I see little merit in fighting to make UTF-16 more attractive.  </s>
<s> - Chris  </s>
<s> Note that only UTF-16 has this problem; UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE do not have multiple byte orderings.  </s>
<s> Because of this, I believe that most systems will try to use BE and LE.  </s>
<s> I fully agree with both sentences.  </s>

<s> I think it is almost ready, but I have a nit.  </s>
<s> 4.3 Interpreting text labelled as UTF-16 Text labelled with the "UTF-16" charset might be serialized in either big-endian or little-endian order.  </s>
<s> If the first two octets of the text is 0xFE followed by 0xFF, then the text can be interpreted as being big-endian.  </s>
<s> If the first two octets of the text is 0xFF followed by 0xFE, then the text can be interpreted as being little-endian.  </s>
<s> ...  </s>
<s> I think that leading 0xFE 0xFF or 0xFF 0xFE in this case (charset = "utf-16") is always a byte order mark and is not a zero-width non-break space.  </s>
<s> I would like to make this explicit, since "the character 0xFEFF in the first position of a stream MAY be interpreted as a zero-width non-breaking space, and is not always a byte-order mark."  </s>
