<s> That is to say, ALT="" has not been disallowed because there are cases where it is the best practice.  </s>
<s> Admittedly some of the argument hangs on the fact that we can't rely on stylesheets to make layout tables obsolete until they are better supported in user agents.  </s>
<s> But all that reasoning still stands.  </s>
<s> The problem is, nowhere in the RECcommendation that Tim signed is this explicitly stated.  </s>
<s> It takes a) searching the working group archives and b) authentication by the chairs that this decision was made and then not reconsidered and overturned by a later deliberation of the group, to bring the consensus resolution to light.  </s>
<s> This is why I was emphasizing the need for a strong GL presence in the process of "life after REC" including this step of detailing the automatable tests related to the checkpoints and how they are related.  </s>

<s> Actually, I am going to vote "nay."  </s>
<s> I think it is important that tools not limit their ambition to mere guideline conformance.  </s>
<s> Caveat: This idea is really centered in the Authoring Tools topic.  </s>
<s> Because I think that the subject areas of AU and ER do and should overlap, I'll continue the thread here and copy there.  </s>
<s> I don't think that the ER nominations or AU guidelines, checkpoints and techniques should say something that conflicts with what the WCAG says, when the WCAG has spoken.  </s>
<s> We can extend this to "clarifications and rulings" from the "life after REC" activities yet to be organized.  </s>
<s> [Note: I believe that in the IG plenary at Toronto, Judy said that WAI-CG should take up the relationship of GL,ER,AU as regards "guidance for tool implementation of the WCAG."]  </s>
<s> But on the other hand, in an interactive dialog one encounters the whole question of "warnings" and other ways of stimulating the author/user which are new territory that the WCAG has not dealt with.  </s>
<s> My favorite one of these at a high level is the idea that authoring tools should transform the document-in-process in ways which emphasize logical structure.  </s>
<s> This logical structure is the foundation for the "transform gracefully" techniques which are developed in the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> A clear example of this is the "use hierarchy properly" concept.  </s>
<s> One can try do do this with formal rules about the existence and cardinality of various Hn elements.  </s>
<s> A much stronger strategy, however, is to offer the author an auto-extracted internal navbar which matches what the adaptive user agent techniques will assume in the way of hierarchy.  </s>
<s> If the author finds this outline view helpful in navigation, they will be likely to write in a well-structured way.  </s>
<s> Similarly with the internal logical structure of a table.  </s>
<s> If the authoring tool highlights the data:header relationships in the default schema for the table as the user is creating the table, then the author will fix gaps in the logical information.  </s>
<s> Otherwise layout will be the only semantics one can trust that the author comprehended.  </s>
<s> Do not expect what you do not inspect.  </s>
<s> Do not expect logical depth in a document unless the author has inspected the deep structure by accepting multiple presentations that change the surface details.  </s>
<s> We should try to be scrupulous to adhere to the WCAG provisions as the GL group determined them.  </s>
<s> But ER and AU tools should by no means be limited to implementing what is in that document.  </s>
<s> There are lots of things that can be done in a tool which advance the intent of the content guidelines without being strictly derived from those guidelines.  </s>

<s> I went back to the group charter to clarify this particular issue.  </s>
<s> In both ER groups (ig &amp; wg), it states... "We will use the author guidelines as a basis for discussion."  </s>
<s> [see pasted excerpts below] ...which seems to support Bruce's statement (assuming that there has not been some later modification to this statement that I am not aware of).  </s>
<s> As there is a nay vote, I also believe a discussion is in order...  </s>
<s> I don't see a problem with breaking down a checkpoint (1.1 in particular) into several sub-categories that can each be better analyzed.  </s>
<s> I believe that this ended up the consensus at the face to face meeting in T.O.  </s>
<s> At that same meeting, I understood that this would in fact be done to Daniel's document "evalauto" which would serve as the basis of this and other discussions (Daniel?).  </s>
<s> Regarding the use of alt=" "... (I'm assuming this use where the author is using a transparent gif for spacing): Going back to the guideline 1 as a basis for this particular discussion: Guideline 1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content.  </s>
<s> The relevant word here to me is "content".  </s>
<s> It seems to me that if I wish to separate content from presentation, and I am using a transparent gif for presentation (which has already broken this concept I know, but assuming it is already being used &amp; our tool is trying to repair it), then there would be no need to provide alternative representation for it (eg.  </s>
<s> spacer).  </s>
<s> If anything, it seems that it would interrupt the flow of content read out in a screen reader.  </s>
<s> I realize that written in the checkpoint (1.1) it says: "Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element...  </s>
<s> This includes...images used as... spacers".  </s>
<s> This suggests that using alt=" " would be "illegal".  </s>
<s> Given the amount written on this particular issue this seems, as noted in a previous note, to be a 'hot' topic.  </s>
<s> As we are focussed on writing tools, I would suggest that we abstract and modularize this component and provide a (tool) user configurable setting.  </s>
<s> In other words, let the person who will be using the tool have the choice as to how they wish to eval/repair this particular instance (etc.  </s>
<s> if alt="" or alt=" ", then pass/fail).  </s>
<s> Of course then there is the issue about what would be the "default" which appears to bring the issue back into our faces.  </s>
<s> The benefit, though, is that it 'lightens' the issue and allows us to carry on with tool development.  </s>
<s> In fact, perhaps an additional column could be added to "evalauto" where we could place multiple choices for the user to decide?  </s>
