<s> Hello, In the 31 March document [1], checkpoint 4.1.1 reads: Ensure that the software may be installed in a device-independent manner using any supported input and output devices.  </s>
<s> And checkpoint 4.2.1 reads Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent interface are available through all supported input devices.  </s>
<s> These include the installation procedure, access to documentation, and software configuration.  </s>
<s> The only reason 4.2.1 doesn't entirely subsume 4.1.1 is that 4.1.1 refers to output devices (covered partially by 4.2.2).  </s>
<s> I propose deleting 4.1.1.  </s>

<s> At the checkpoint level, I think it is better to separate installation from repeat use.  </s>
<s> You can have a common guideline about all user actions required to install, use and maintain... (check EITAAC report for sample language and cite at least in draft) http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/eitaac/ .  </s>
<s> In the dominant pattern of commercial practice the installer is a separate program, not one of the functions of the program.  </s>
<s> This colors public perceptions, and we should talk in publicly-understood concepts where we can.  </s>
<s> This was a point where at least one vendor spokesperson drew a line: making a distinction between repeat use where access support was obvious to them and install transactions which are a "one time thing" and were perceived as less meritorious of the necessary investment.  </s>
<s> If we wish overcome that perception, we will have to spell it out in two checks; not throw a blanket over them.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Hi Al, One way to avoid the blanket is to enumerate the important cases in the general checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Something like the following: Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent interface are available through all supported input devices.  </s>
<s> This includes installation, access to documentation, and software configuration.  </s>
<s> Then, to repeat the discussion in the rationale section and techniques document.  </s>

<s> can.  </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong.  </s>
<s> For my own use, I distinctly prefer a short (Occam's razor) list of powerful principles that generate all the necessary cases.  </s>
<s> I spend a lot of my life railing againsf over-atomization that destroys the gestalt.  </s>
<s> But this document has to communicate to lots of people and not just me.  </s>
<s> The popular definition of a checklist item is something you can or would normally observe by itself.  </s>
<s> On balance I think it is better to show the unity in a theory section and split these particular two in the checklist for the reasons I stated.  </s>
<s> This is just an indication of my individual opinion on something I regard as a "better" not a "showstopper" distinction.  </s>
