<s> Issue 6 - Defining semantic relationships  </s>
<s> Description: A thesaurus consists of concepts, labels for concepts, and  </s>
<s> semantic relationships between concepts.  </s>
<s> A semantic relationship is a  </s>
<s> relationship of meaning.  </s>
<s> Most thesauri use a similar set of semantic  </s>
<s> relationships, which they label 'broader' 'narrower' and 'related'.  </s>
<s> Problem 1: 'broader/narrower' means different things in different thesauri.  </s>
<s> In some thesauri it means strictly class-subsumption.  </s>
<s> In other thesauri it  </s>
<s> can mean either is-a, instance-of, or part-of.  </s>
<s> Also 'related' is not  </s>
<s> consistently used.  </s>
<s> For example some thesauri model part-of relations with  </s>
<s> 'related', others use 'broader/narrower' = We must invent some mechanism for providing clear definitions of semantic  </s>
<s> relationships, and for removing any scope for ambiguity.  </s>
<s> Problem 2: some thesauri have semantic relations other than 'broader/narrower' and 'related'.  </s>
<s> Some overcome the 'broader/narrower'  </s>
<s> fuzziness by using 'BTI', 'BTG' and 'BTP', which stand for 'broader-term-instantive' 'broader-term-generic' and 'broader-term-partitive' respectively.  </s>
<s> In others there are custom relationships like 'related-broader'.  </s>
<s> = We must provide some mechanism by which users can extend the given  </s>
<s> relationship set and define their own semantic relations.  </s>

<s> One of the immediate applications that occurs to me for RDF thesauruses is in mapping between discrete taxonomies.  </s>
<s> Whatever approach to defining relationships is adopted, I hope it will be straightforward to take a tree  </s>
<s> like the Open Directory website categorization [1] and be able to map across to corresponding terms in another hierarchy like the Topic Exchange [2], and carry out merge-like operations (I say merge-like because the structures may be incompatible, and class/subclass relationships may only work in localized regions of the trees).  </s>

<s> Cheers Dave.  </s>
<s> This seems amenable to subProperty relationships.  </s>
<s> You could have a base property "thesaurusRelationship", subProperties for  </s>
<s> broader/narrower, subProperties of those for specific usages like strict  </s>
<s> isa, partof etc.  </s>
<s> In that way some could use a strict partOf relation and a thesaurus tool that only understood BT would be able to treat it as a broaderTerm.  </s>

<s> Hi Dave, I agree, I think having a property set like ...  </s>
<s> ... would be good for thesaurus-specific applications.  </s>
<s> However, here is  </s>
<s> where we start treading on the toes of RDF RDFS and OWL.  </s>
<s> The property  </s>
<s> thes:broaderGeneric would be semantically equivalent to rdfs:subClassOf ,  </s>
<s> and the property thes:broaderInstantive would be semantically equivalent  </s>
<s> to rdf:type .  </s>
<s> How do we handle this kind of overlap?  </s>
<s> Al.  </s>
<s> Hi Alistair,  </s>
<s> I'm not sure there is a problem here.  </s>
<s> If BG and BI are truly equivalent to  </s>
<s> rdfs:subClassOf and rdf:type then just define them as equivalent using  </s>
<s> either owl:equivalentProperty or a pair of rdfs:subPropertyOf relations.  </s>
<s> That's the beauty of RDF - open world, multiple inheritance, cycles allowed.  </s>
<s> Then a thesaurus processor could take an RDFS file and realise, for example, that an rdfs:subClassOf relation implies thes:broader.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> OK, so shall we have and  </s>
<s> soks:broaderGeneric owl:equivalentProperty rdfs:subClassOf .  </s>
<s> soks:broaderInstantive owl:equivalentProperty rdf:type .  </s>
<s> Any objections??? Al.  </s>
<s> If they really are the same thing, why not just stop using them, since the rdfs: stuff is likely to be understood by tools already?  </s>
