<s> It seems to me that much (but not all) of the discussion over the last few months on the Expires, Last-Modified headers is really due to the desire of server administrators to control whether a document is cached.  </s>
<s> One of the big improvements in the current HTTP spec is the "Pragma:  </s>
<s> no-cache" header.  </s>
<s> This provides a way to say, "Don't cache this,"  </s>
<s> without the need for fictitious expiration or last-modified dates.  </s>
<s> This is important.  </s>
<s> There are often good reasons for saying that a document should not be cached, but having a future expiration date (for example, if the validity of the document doesn't, in fact *expire* until that date).  </s>
<s> The only problem is that server admins often want to prevent local disk caching as well as proxy caching and the Pragma: no-cache applies only to the latter.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we also need a "Pragma: no-local-cache".  </s>
<s> One thing of which I am thoroughly convinced is that if a clean mechanism for giving administrators this capablility is not made available then every conceivable ugly hack which has the desired effect will gain widespread use.  </s>
<s> We will see 1970 expiration dates (always a lie) and future last-modified dates (also a lie).  </s>
<s> These hacks will likely work with some clients/proxies and fail with others.  </s>
<s> There will, no doubt, even be those who use different hacks based on the User-Agent header of the request!  </s>
<s> Why not make life easier for everyone and allow a server to cleanly request that a document not be cached to local disk.  </s>
<s> This should be a separate request from the Pragma: no-cache request to prevent proxy caching.  </s>

<s> I recently changed netscape to interpret "Pragma: no-cache" and not cache the object.  </s>
<s> This is slightly different than a "Expires" header because the object will not even be cached for history navigation.  </s>

<s> Haveing the client interpret "Pragma: no-cache" lets servers tell the client that this information is highly sensitive or volitile and should not be cached in any way.  </s>

<s> The reason Pragma: no-cache is not a redundant way of saying Expires:  </s>

<s> documents to particular clients where these documents need not expire  </s>
<s> immediately.  </s>
<s> If intermediate proxies cannot cache the document (due  </s>
<s> to Pragma: no-cache) but clients can, this makes for more flexibility at the client end.  </s>
<s> The client would not be required to issue a new HTTP request when revisiting the non-expired document.  </s>
<s> Since this appears to be the only added functionality of Pragma: no-cache as a return header, though, I think it probably should have been called  </s>
<s> something else, such as Pragma: private (or something equally, or more, mnemonic).  </s>
<s> The problem with calling it Pragma: no-cache is that user-agent designers will feel that it ought to have some effect on the client, which it shouldn't, because Expires is sufficient for controlling caching in the client.  </s>
<s> So I think the above mentioned changes to Netscape are probably ill advised and in fact defeat the purpose of this header.  </s>
<s> If it stays in the Netscape browser as mentioned, the new header will have been rendered useless.  </s>

<s> Hmmm, that's a different interpretation than what I perceived from the third-hand descriptions of what this feature might do.  </s>
<s> It really is better to hear about protocol experiments from the source.  </s>
<s> Something that the WG needs to keep in mind is that what I write in the *draft* specification is what I believe to be the abstract and specific semantics of each feature in the protocol.  </s>
<s> I am counting on people to correct me when what I write does not match their own interpretation of the protocol.  </s>
<s> Since I've developed my own client library, client, and small portions of two servers, most of the time I do get it right, but certainly not all of the time.  </s>
<s> What I wrote in Draft 01 for the Pragma field's abstract semantics may be wrong.  </s>
<s> It is based on my interpretation of the meaning of the current "no-cache" request header, and I merely extended that semantics to the other directives.  </s>
<s> Pragma directives must be passed through by a proxy, regardless of their significance to that proxy, since the directives may be applicable to all intermediaries along the request/response chain.  </s>
<s> It is not possible to specify a pragma for a specific proxy; however, any pragma directive not relevant to a proxy should be ignored.  </s>
<s> Instead of "intermediaries", we could say "recipients", and the following paragraph: Pragma directives do not apply to the end-points of a request/response chain.  </s>
<s> For example, a user agent's internal (non-  </s>
<s> shared) cache and/or history mechanism should ignore all pragma  </s>
<s> directives in received messages.  </s>
<s> Similarly, pragma directives are not applicable to the origin of a resource, though they may be applicable to a server's internal response cache.  </s>
<s> could be replaced with Pragma directives only apply to recipients that implement features corresponding to the directive's semantics.  </s>
<s> For example, a no-cache directive tells the recipient not to make use of its caching mechanism in satisfying the request when it occurs in a request header, or in storing the response when it occurs in a response.  </s>
<s> Pragma directives are also unidirectional in that the presence of a directive in a request does not imply that the same directive be given in the response.  </s>
<s> We can then add a new directive to cover the semantics of a response  </s>
<s> that must not be shared by multiple users.  </s>
<s> We could call it "private",  </s>
<s> but I am afraid that this would also imply privacy, which it shouldn't.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, there does not seem to be an antonym for "shared" or "communal", so how about Pragma: non-shared no-sharing do-not-share Er, on second thought, maybe we should just use "private"...  </s>

<s> Roy,  </s>
<s> Please correct me if I miss your point... What do we gain by having both a 'no-cache' and a 'private' Pragma in terms of functionality ?  </s>
<s> A 'shared response cache' is basically a proxy/cache, and Pragma is meaningful to proxies only, not to user agents.  </s>
<s> So both headers really mean "don't cache this response in a proxy/cache", and both let a user-agent local cache free to cache the response or not.  </s>
<s> What's the point of adding 'private' then ?  </s>
<s> I would understand it if 'non-shared response proxy/caches' were a reality, but AFAIK, they are not !  </s>
<s> I think both cases you described above should use 'Pragma: no-cache'.  </s>
<s> Jean-Philippe  </s>
<s> Jean-Philippe Martin-Flatin:  </s>
<s> Pragma: private would instruct a user agent not to cache the response if its cache memory (say part of a harddisk in an MS-DOS pc in a university PC lab) is publicly accessible.  </s>
<s> This is particularly important for user agents that do not clear their caches at the end of the session.  </s>
<s> Of course, the user agent needs to be configured to know that its cache is publicly accessible, one could have a configuration option like `cache private responses on local disk?'.  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> Instead of "recipients", I would prefer "proxies".  </s>
<s> "Recipients", which isn't defined in section 1.3 of draft-ietf-http-spec.html, encompasses the proxies and the user agent in my view, whereas the Pragma header field is not destined for the user agent.  </s>
<s> This somewhat changes the scope of Pragma, which is no longer restricted to proxies in the new paragraph.  </s>
<s> I think the name "Pragma" confuses a number of people (cf Lou's initial interpretation), and it's not clear to all whether a Pragma header field is destined for proxies only, or for proxies and user agents.  </s>
<s> Based on the fact that not so many WWW clients and servers already implement Pragma, I propose that we replace the name "Pragma" with the name "Proxy".  </s>
<s> Maybe in HTTP/1.1 specs ?  </s>
<s> It would be crystal clear that 'Proxy: no-cache' is not destined for user agents.  </s>
<s> Jean-Philippe  </s>
<s> When I say the "Pragma" header orginially, my first throught was #pragma in ANSI C: an escape hatch to provide implementation-specific information.  </s>
<s> Now, this was added originally for the benifit of the CERN proxy server, and the language of the specs reflect this, but I'm not sure we need to stick with this if we can be clear what the scope of particular Pragmas is... the nature of this sort of thing is that implementations will (and usually should) ignore/discard unknown pragmas.  </s>
<s> I _would_ like us to use some kind of current-practice or best-current-practice interpretation of Pragma: no-cache and If-Modified-Since: rather than redefining them in some more complicated/tricky way: thus I tend to favor the suggestions that add new headers/pragmas to offer new semantics.  </s>
