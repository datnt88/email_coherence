<s> Hello, Per my action of the 1-2 March face-to-face meeting [1], please consider the following Guideline splits.  </s>
<s> These will appear in the next draft for review in context.  </s>
<s> 1) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft: Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering and viewport behavior.  </s>
<s> Split into: Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering.  </s>
<s> Guideline 5. Ensure user control of user interface behavior.  </s>
<s> Guideline 5 is the result of the decision to group checkpoints about user control over UI behavior under one heading.  </s>
<s> These (abridged) checkpoints are: 5.1 Allow configuration so that the current focus does not move automatically to viewports that open without explicit user request.  </s>
<s> 5.2 For graphical user interfaces, allow configuration so that the viewport with the current focus remains "on top" of all other viewports with which it overlaps.  </s>
<s> 5.3 Allow configuration so that viewports only open on explicit user request.  </s>
<s> 5.4 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any form submission not caused by explicit user request to activate a form submit control.  </s>
<s> 5.5 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any payment resulting from activation of a fee link.  </s>
<s> 5.6 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any viewport that closes without explicit user request.  </s>
<s> QUESTION: Should Guideline 4 read: "Ensure user control of rendering and styles" since there a style sheet checkpoint as well?  </s>
<s> 2) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft: Guideline 5. Observe operating environment conventions and standard interfaces.  </s>
<s> This guideline has started to grow large and there's a clear division of checkpoints into "things for APIs" and "things related to observing conventions".  </s>
<s> Therefore I propose splitting it into: Guideline 6. Implement standard application programming interfaces.  </s>
<s> (10 checkpoints, all about APIs) Guideline 7. Observe operating environment conventions.  </s>
<s> (4 checkpoints) Note: I don't mind having 12 Guidelines (not as good as 10, but better than 11... and even dozen!) - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010224/ Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>

<s> [snip] Split into: Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering.  </s>
<s> Guideline 5. Ensure user control of user interface behavior.  </s>
<s> CMN: Fine by me IJ QUESTION: Should Guideline 4 read: "Ensure user control of rendering and styles" since there a style sheet checkpoint as well?  </s>
<s> CMN Don't see why - style is rendering.  </s>
<s> IJ 2) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft: Guideline 5. Observe operating environment conventions and standard interfaces.  </s>

<s> (10 checkpoints, all about APIs) Guideline 7. Observe operating environment conventions.  </s>
<s> (4 checkpoints) Sure.  </s>
<s> Note that I consider this stuff editorial.  </s>
<s> If it isn't then the checkpoints don't stand properly as a list of requirements which indicates that there is a major flaw in the document.  </s>
<s> Chaals  </s>
<s> I'd ad style to the title of the checkpoint.  </s>
