<s> I've come across what may or may not be an issue in RFC2616.  </s>
<s> In section 4.3 (Message Body) there is a line that reads:  </s>
<s> "A message-body MUST NOT be included in a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)  </s>
<s> does not allow sending an entity-body in requests."  </s>
<s> However, there is no reference to such restrictions in 5.1.1.  </s>
<s> It seems logical that it could be referring to GET and HEAD requests, but I can't find an answer anywhere else in the document.  </s>
<s> Are GET/HEAD requests allowed to have entities or should section 5.1.1 (or possibly 9.3/9.4  </s>
<s> ?) have errata on this issue?  </s>
<s> Is there something in the RFC on this issue that I'm missing?  </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated...  </s>
<s> Kimberly Horne  </s>
<s> Section 5.1.1 is essentially a table-of-contents for request method specifications.  </s>
<s> For example, "GET" is described in Section 9.3.  </s>
<s> Thus, I think the RFC wording is acceptable.  </s>
<s> As far as I can see, RFC 2616 does not prohibit use of entity bodies in GET or HEAD.  </s>
<s> Thus, according to the section 4.3, there might be a body transmitted with those requests: The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in the request's message-headers.  </s>
<s> A message-body MUST NOT be included in a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)  </s>
<s> does not allow sending an entity-body in requests.  </s>
<s> How many servers/proxies would be confused by GET bodies is a different question.  </s>

<s> It looks like we didn't actually close this issue well enough, since it's still being raised.  </s>
<s> Certainly the archive record is that the intent was (for compatibility) to disallow bodies for  </s>
<s> GET, HEAD and DELETE, but possibly allow bodies on other  </s>
<s> methods unless explicitly disallowed (for extensibility's sake).  </s>
<s> Aha! This answers my question nicely, thank you.  </s>
<s> I was unaware of the existance of the Last Call document.  </s>
<s> The reason I brought this up was because I was running into a problem  </s>
<s> where a piece of client software was adding a "Content-Length: 0" header to all GET requests it sent.  </s>
<s> All the webservers that I tried it on completed the requests without complaint but when a (transparent) squid proxy was added into the mix it stopped working (with a 411 response  </s>
<s> code, of all things).  </s>
<s> I wasn't sure which end of the problem I should fix.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> The discussion at the above URL implies that some part of the RFC prohibits bodies for GETs.  </s>
<s> Could anybody point to that part?  </s>
<s> I do not see anything prohibiting bodies in Section 9.3 "GET".  </s>
<s> Hmm.. I am surprised you are sure now, but perhaps I am missing something in the RFC that the above URLs helped you find.  </s>
<s> To me, it still looks like the RFC does not prohibit (and, hence, allows) bodies for GETs.  </s>
<s> Please clarify.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Alex.  </s>

<s> I should warn you that the issue of "GET with body" has been controversial.  </s>
<s> Let's look at the whole paragraph: The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in the request's message-headers.  </s>
<s> A message-body MUST NOT be included in a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)  </s>
<s> does not allow sending an entity-body in requests.  </s>
<s> A server SHOULD read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.  </s>
<s> The problematic phrase is "does not allow": does this mean the same thing as "forbids", or does it mean "does not explicitly allow".  </s>
<s> And this is a problem because the definitions of  </s>
<s> GET, HEAD and DELETE do not mention an entity-body, so they  </s>
<s> don't "explicitly allow" one, but they also don't forbid one.  </s>
<s> The method definitions for OPTIONS, POST, PUT mention entity definitions and (for POST and PUT) their semantics.  </s>
<s> TRACE explicitly disallows an entity-body; CONNECT and extension-methods aren't defined.  </s>
<s> And that's all of the methods defined in RFC 2616.  </s>
<s> I believe (and I think the email record supports) that the  </s>
<s> assumption has been that GET, HEAD and DELETE don't have  </s>
<s> entity bodies and thus senders MUST NOT send one, even though proxies and servers SHOULD read, forward and (when processing) ignore one if they get one.  </s>
<s> I also think this is the safest interpretation; certainly it wouldn't be possible to add any semantics to entity bodies for GET or HEAD, since proxies and other kinds of intermediaries would discard them.  </s>
<s> I'm tempted to call this an errata: we intended to write the specification more clearly but failed to do so.  </s>
<s> However, given the noise around 'GET with body', I suppose we might need to treat this as an issue.  </s>
<s> The main point of forbidding body with GET is the belief that it would fail with large chunks of deployed infrastructure; servers that would crash or give erroneous results if presented with a GET with a body.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any reports, although I remember some speculation about this.  </s>

<s> I haven't seen any reports, although I remember some speculation about this.  </s>
<s> Here's a little thought experiment: Can we construct an example request that is ambiguous if the server DOES accept a body for a GET?  </s>
<s> For example, GET /foo.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com  </s>
<s> GET /bar.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com  </s>
<s> Connection: close Is this example: (a) a pipelined connection with two GETs for distinction URLs?  </s>
<s> (b) a single GET whose "body" looks a lot like the headers for another GET, but is actually just a BODY.  </s>
<s> Probably if the example had included an explicit Content-length field in the first group of headers, the ambiguity would go away, but I think the Message Length rules (section 4.4) don't require that.  </s>
<s> My vote: treat this as an erratum; ban bodies for GET, HEAD, and DELETE.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> There is no ambiguity.  </s>
<s> No content-length in a request means length == 0.  </s>
<s> No. You may think of this as just "clarifying" the spec, but in reality it changes the parsing algorithm on the server such that the server must know the semantics of every message that passes through it, such that extensibility of methods becomes impossible.  </s>
<s> The server already has an unambiguous algorithm for interpreting the length of a message.  </s>
<s> Whether or not GET allows a message body is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> HTTP allows a message body on any request.  </s>
<s> The fact that clients should not send useless bodies does not lessen the requirement of servers to parse a message independent of the message semantics.  </s>
<s> The only exception is HEAD responses, and that only because of legacy issues.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> Roy, you're mixing server and client responsibilities.  </s>
<s> It's quite possible to mandate "must not send a body with GET" for clients and also mandate "must parse and ignore message bodies with GET" for servers.  </s>
<s> Jeff:  </s>
<s> I think this was mandated for legacy reasons.  </s>
<s> Roy:  </s>
<s> While this is mandated for future extensibility.  </s>
<s> I don't think the two are incompatible.  </s>
<s> There is no ambiguity.  </s>
<s> No content-length in a request means length == 0. My mistake.  </s>
<s> I must have missed the part of RFC2616 that says this. In fact, I still can't find it; perhaps you could point out the specific normative language?  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> Section 4.3 of RFC 2068 says The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in the request's message-headers.  </s>
<s> A message-body MAY be included in a request only when the request method (section 5.1.1)  </s>
<s> allows an entity-body.  </s>
<s> and in RFC 2616 it says The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in the request's message-headers.  </s>
<s> A message-body MUST NOT be included in a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)  </s>
<s> does not allow sending an entity-body in requests.  </s>
<s> A server SHOULD read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.  </s>
<s> In both cases, the first sentence is unambiguous.  </s>
<s> The example you gave had neither Content-Length nor Transfer-Encoding. ....Roy  </s>
<s> Just the opposite.  </s>
<s> I was stating the requirement as it is currently written -- separating server and client responsibilities.  </s>
<s> The message parsing algorithm does not know about method semantics aside from HEAD responses.  </s>
<s> Whether or not a body is included with GET is not determined by the method semantics -- a server that does not anticipate and correctly parse a GET request with a body is not compliant with the protocol.  </s>
<s> Adding yet another requirement to HTTP just to say that a client MUST NOT send a body with GET, HEAD, DELETE, etc., will not change the interoperability of the current protocol and it absolutely must not change the message parsing algorithm (the example that Jeff was talking about).  </s>
<s> Doing so only eliminates the possibility that future extensions might use the request body for those methods.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
