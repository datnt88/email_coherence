<s> I though it enhances accessibility and makes it easier to change styles.  </s>
<s> When Jose saw it he asked if Amaya should help to produce that to enhance  </s>
<s> accessibility.  </s>
<s> Using the same classes consistently sounded like a good idea and I promised some checkpoints to back this practice up.  </s>
<s> When I carefully rechecked the guidelines, the only thing I could find was 12.3 .  </s>
<s> Guideline 3 and 13 somehow support this, but there are no checkpoints that I could apply to this.  </s>
<s> So should we say something more explicit or is it that there are no accessibility benefits in doing this and I should stop?  </s>

<s> I can see how it would help with styles.  </s>
<s> But I'm not sure exactly how it would help with accessibility.  </s>
<s> No reason to stop, necessarily.  </s>
<s> It's somewhat interesting but I'm not sure what you actually do with  </s>
<s> the information you're encoding here.  </s>
<s> How you style and/or transform  </s>
<s> this content would create the value here, not just the encoding of meaning/intent.  </s>
<s> (Current browsers don't, to the best of my knowledge, do anything useful with this.) What you're trying to capture here would be expressed in (arbitrary) XML as something like: Basic architecture showing the communication between the client and the annotation servers.  </s>
<s> The basic architecture of Annotea.  </s>
<s> ...but then how you use that information will be very dependent upon how you use it.  </s>
<s> ("Style and/or transform" in my paragraph above.) (X)HTML unfortunately doesn't have a rich enough set of presentation to express what we want, but there are several ways to render this which might work -- such as using the table tag to group related content: table summary="Figure Fig-1: The basic architecture of Annotea." class="figure" Figure 1: The basic architecture of Annotea.  </s>
<s> img src="architecture.png"  </s>
<s> alt="Basic architecture showing the communication between the client and annotation servers."/  </s>
<s> (The above can be generated from the XML using XSLT relatively easily.)  </s>
<s> Or, as you've done in the original, you can use div for this kind of thing.  </s>
<s> Or some other presentation depending on what you're trying to  </s>
<s> accomplish.  </s>
<s> Note that this example is by necessity limited; no longdesc is given which fully explains the architecture, and the caption and the alt attribute provide pretty much identical information -- a more complete example would be something like: Basic architecture showing the communication between the client and the annotation servers.  </s>
<s> The basic architecture of Annotea.  </s>
<s> When a client requests an annotation from a blah blah blah blah blah blah and that's how it works.  </s>
<s> Or possibly just: Basic architecture showing the communication between the client and the annotation servers.  </s>
<s> The basic architecture of Annotea.  </s>
<s> My basic comment is that you wouldn't want to write your _content_ in the manner you describe -- you hopefully would want to write it in non-XHTML XML -- but that the way you produced output markup from that content is okay but not the only way to present that type of information.  </s>
<s> (Which serves to illustrate a weakness with (X)HTML -- multiple ways of presenting the same semantic mean that it is a poor language for encoding semantics!)  </s>

<s> These are some things I had in my mind when doing this: - also a nonvisual user knows that the image and the caption text are  </s>
<s> related - the caption is not just another paragraph - user can ask to see caption and alt text together if images are not displayed - user can use classes in his stylesheet to change the type/ color etc. of  </s>
<s> the caption so that it is easier to find search for them when visually browsing through the text or use the class to browse through them by using braille or speech  </s>
<s> - user who want's to read the text first can skip the image and it's caption and then come back to it later  </s>
<s> - if user gathers images to a list he can also gather their captions  </s>
<s> Marja  </s>
<s> How? There is no obvious relationship encoded in the markup.  </s>
<s> In what user agents can you make this distinction?  </s>
<s> Yes, but using classes in user-defined stylesheets is highly problematic, because classes are not meant to be universal over the range of web sites.  </s>
<s> A user relying upon specific class names can easily -introduce- accessibility errors.  </s>
<s> (And of course anything that requires the user to be able to code CSS is a bad solution.)  </s>
<s> How?  </s>
<s> How? What user agents do this?  </s>
<s> Marja, I don't understand how you think the stated benefits actually occur from the type of markup you used.  </s>
<s> Yes, those are the right -ideas-, but saying that encoding the page thusly in (X)HTML produces those benefits is incorrect, since I don't believe that any of them actually -work- as you'd like them to work.  </s>
<s> You could say the same thing about encoding it in XML as well, and it probably makes more sense to do so since the way you want to use classes is not the way classes work, either in practice or in theory.  </s>
<s> They are the wrong mechanism for doing what you want to do here.  </s>
<s> ((X)HTML lacks such a mechanism, which is the root of the problem.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> I was trying to see a bit further than what we may or may not have today as there is always that chicken and egg problem.  </s>
<s> Many things maybe cumbersome now, but when user agent let users to have several ways to browse the pages and the elements on the pages, it could be different.  </s>
<s> At least at one point the UA guidelines had all kinds of browsing mechanism that should be offered to the user.  </s>
<s> Maybe a site could even provide some accessibility friendly metadata of the class or other conventions they are using.  </s>
<s> I don't know how you want to use XML elements for these conventions, for instance, if you use SVG and have several triangle elements belonging to different categories according to their appearance, (e.g. color and texture and how they move) would it be better to not tell to the user looking the markup that they are actually related than use some available mechanisms, such as symbols, classes and stylesheets?  </s>
<s> And I know very well, there are no conventions for classes but my question is should we try to support authors to make them?  </s>
<s> At least at the site level?  </s>
<s> And how could that then help accessibility?  </s>
<s> I would think it helps at least offering the users some ready made alternative style sheets.  </s>
<s> And if nothing else it helps managing the site stylesheets.  </s>

<s> /p What is different in the presentation over just using img src="architecture.png"  </s>
<s> alt="Basic architecture showing the communication between the client and the annotation servers" Does the caption appear in the visual presentation?  </s>
<s> Is the caption read in a speech reader?  </s>
<s> Does the information in div class ever get presented to a user who doesn't read the source code?  </s>
