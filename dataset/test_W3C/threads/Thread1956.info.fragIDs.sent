<s> It goes something like this: a) If message includes Content-Length, use it.  </s>
<s> b) If message uses an as-yet-undefined packetized Content-Transfer-Encodin then that encoding may define an EOF marker.  </s>
<s> c) If message uses an as-yet-undefined packetized Content-Encoding, then that encoding may define an EOF marker.  </s>
<s> d) If message is of type multipart/*, the effective object body ends when the boundary close-delimiter is reached.  </s>
<s> e) If the connection closes, the object body has ended.  </s>
<s> Part (b) is along the lines of Dan Connolly's www-talk proposal of 27 Sep 1994 (Message-Id: 9409271503.AA27488@austin2.hal.com ).  </s>
<s> I'm happy with the situation for responses (connection closes is quite good enough), but still very unhappy with this definition for the data (object body) for requests (PUT and POST).  </s>
<s> The steps you just outlined are not defined sufficiently well to be implementable (and requiring every server to implement the rather gawky multi-part stuff just in case data comes in that way seems unnecessary).  </s>
<s> Is not Content-Length essentially always present, in current practice, for PUT and POST?  </s>
<s> In which case, why require more that this, or alternatives, unless truly necessary?  </s>
<s> The intention is to move away from "connection closes is quite good enough" so that future versions of HTTP can support a connection keep-alive.  </s>
<s> Multipart types have always been possible to implement -- its just that server and client authors have neglected (in the past) to read the MIME spec and thus understand that these things exist and how they are implemented.  </s>
<s> Including these descriptions in the spec is a way to prod people into implementing something that should have been supported long ago.  </s>
<s> Whether they stay in the spec, get moved to an appendix, or get shoved off to HTTP/1.1 is a question for the group to decide.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the response .. and I applaud the intent to move away from 'connection closes is enough' in the future.  </s>
<s> However, you really haven't answered my questions for today that would enable me to implement a server from the HTTP 1.0 specification.  </s>
<s> In particular, what is a conforming HTTP 1.0 server required to implement in order to read the object data for PUT and POST?  </s>
<s> Specifically: (a) Content-Length: in bytes [I assume this one is required] (b) Packetized C-T-E: might well be useful, but only if the CTEs are defined.  </s>
<s> Do I have to support PC-DOS ZIP?  </s>
<s> Do I have to support Unix GZIP?  </s>
<s> If not defined and required, then clients cannot use them, and hence they are not useful.  </s>
<s> [Also, one would need a statement about how (a) and (b) interact.]  </s>
<s> (c) C-E: Ditto -- only plain Binary is even suggested, at present, so there isn't anything to implement, I think?  </s>
<s> (d) Multipart: Is this current practice?  </s>
<s> If not, I trust that it's not required in 1.0.  </s>
<s> (e) Closed connection: [Doesn't apply for Requests.] rom the above, my inference is that an HTTP 1.0 server need only implement (a).  </s>
<s> Any more would be wasteful processing.  </s>
<s> Am I correct?  </s>
<s> Thanks -- Mike  </s>
<s> Current practice is (a) -- it just doesn't work any other way with existing servers.  </s>
<s> Ummm, I think (b) and (c) are confused, but these are reasonable questions.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the HTTP spec must define not only origin servers, but proxies, gateways, and client usage of HTTP as well.  </s>
<s> We (as in the authors) will have to clarify this in the next version.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a section on  </s>
<s> minimal compliance is called for.  </s>

<s> OK, thanks.  </s>
<s> Now I know what code to write, this weekend, and you know at least one sentence that needs to be added to the Internet Draft.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> By the way, if there's something I can do to help, let me know.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a section on minimal compliance is called for.  </s>
<s> It's hard to find a 'good' standard that doesn't at least try and provide one (and it's not always easy--a 'COPYFILE' command satisfies many programming language standards, for example :-) Mike Cowlishaw  </s>
