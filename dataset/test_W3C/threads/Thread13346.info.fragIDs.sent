<s> There are a lot of applets on the web that could be made more accessible.  </s>
<s> For example, scrolling tickers on the web, where text goes scrolling by.  </s>
<s> You can sometimes click on items to take you to an appropriate place.  </s>
<s> Speaking as a sighted user, I really dislike these and hardly ever bother reading them.  </s>
<s> For blind users they can get even worse... impossible to read... may even monopolize attention of screenreader.  </s>
<s> A typical ticker is an applet with params like param name=msg0  </s>
<s> value="Editor sought for Faculty Herald ***  </s>
<s> \\http://www.temple.edu/news/FHeditor.html"  </s>
<s> Rather than do a custom parser for this particular variety of a ticker, how about an algorithm that simply 1. Lists all names and params of applet 2. any values which "look like" urls, or any portions of applets that "look like" urls, would be converted to links What does "look like" mean?  </s>
<s> In this case, it's easy... anything that starts with http, and/or ends with .html.  </s>
<s> For links that go to directories, so there's no syntactical clue, may not be possible.  </s>
<s> Another example is the ticker at http:www.att.com.  </s>
<s> It has params like between wireless and wireline" data, IP services" Now in this case the params for a particular item are all grouped together but that doesn't have to be the case.  </s>
<s> The key is a naming convention where tag names get repeated, except for the last character, which is a number.  </s>
<s> I see this convention a lot.  </s>
<s> So the next rule is: 3. Look for this pattern: groups of names which are all the same except for last character which is a number.  </s>
<s> read parameters in that order.  </s>
<s> A simpler version of this is to simply sort according to the terminating number, being sure that e.g. 10 cames *after* 1 Other rules 4. If a value looks like a color and colors are same for all, ignore it 5. If value is different for each, so it may be significant, translate to english, e.g. CC0000 is red These sorts of rules could I think be added to tools like the ALT text tools, since the parsing and use is in the same spirit.  </s>
<s> Of course, another approach to these applets is to write them with accessible java.  </s>
<s> But tools would still be needed till all screenreaders or standalong browsers could handle correctly, and all web page authors used accessibility hooks.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure if your experience of applet parameters is as broad as there is (the general case scenario would be to analyse the Java itself and thus solve the halting problem) and I'm not sure if the benefit gained by making these parameters accessible would justify the effort put in.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> But even for applets other than the scrolling ticker, I suggest that for many applets, it will be useful to list the names and values of the params, at least params that are text or url's.  </s>
<s> This is because applets used by non-programmers will be cannned effects populated with a list of easy to enter params, like names and colors, not hexidecimal equivalents of a set of bits.  </s>

<s> (Please use the www.accu.org  </s>

<s> Neat! Yes, that rendered the scrolling ticker at http://www.att.com accessible.  </s>

<s> In this special case, you could make the text "AT&amp;T Worldnet..." a link with the URL on the second line, and discard the third line.  </s>
<s> However, this means we're guessing the semantics and gets away from the simple algorithm of just listing the applet params.  </s>
<s> It would take some more experiments to find out whether guessing semantics helps or hurts.  </s>
<s> As for why you didn't see a ticker at http://www.temple.edu  </s>
<s> That's a version that contains frames and a scrolling ticker.  </s>
<s> The web access gateway however goes to the noframes version, which doesn't have a ticker.  </s>
<s> So I guess at this point it doesn't handle frames?  </s>

<s> The problem was that www.temple.edu is actually now a no frames site, and I hadn't thought of following the link to the frames version.  </s>

<s> Normally when a sighted user moves the mouse over a link, the status window displays the URL that the link points to.  </s>
