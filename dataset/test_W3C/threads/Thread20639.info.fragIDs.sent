<s> Hello, I have recently upgraded to Amaya 4.2.1 and I think you did a good job, concerning documents in English language.  </s>
<s> I however work mostly in German language.  </s>
<s> When I load a document (XHTML Strict), Amaya stops at the first dieresis with a parsing error.  </s>
<s> That has  </s>
<s> good cause because the diereses are saved not XHTML - compliant as "&amp;auml;" and "&amp;szlig;" but as "?" and "?" because previous versions of Amaya did not support this correctly.  </s>
<s> So I ran the finishing script converting the diereses to XHTML compliance and opened the document again, no errors.  </s>
<s> But as I saved the document back with Amaya, Amaya converted all XHTML-style diereses back to German standard notation.  </s>
<s> The next opening of the selfsame document caused above errors.  </s>
<s> This also applies to other symbols like the copyright (c) and (R).  </s>
<s> I use Amaya under Win NT 4.0 SP6a, but this bug seriously hampers my working.  </s>
<s> Are there possibilities to get back to an older version, like 3.2, the last I was using?  </s>
<s> Could I fix it myself somehow?  </s>
<s> Greetings, Thea Schwabach, Germany  </s>
<s> I believe that XML defaults to UTF-8.  </s>
<s> Have you taken all necessary steps to ensure that everything is assuming ISO 8859/1 (the default for HTML over HTTP).  </s>

<s> Hi, The error was in old versions like 3.2 which handled ISO-latin-1 files without setting the encoding The version 4.0 detected these errors and proposed to set the encoding.  </s>
<s> Today the best solution is to add encoding="iso-8859-1" in the xml declaration in the source view and save the document FROM the source view (not from the formatted view).  </s>
<s> HTML and XML use a different default encoding and tools (including previous versions of Amaya) didn't take care of that difference.  </s>
<s> I guess it's already the case today for a lot of browsers that parse HTML and XHTML documents with the same parser.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the inconvenience.  </s>
<s> It should work better after that change.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
