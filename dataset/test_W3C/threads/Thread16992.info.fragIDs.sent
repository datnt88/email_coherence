<s> Yep, I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiments, however, you would have thought that if those involved with accessibility had been asked then this kind of thing could have been avoided and the new Flash software would have been accessible to all - the purpose of this list is to make websites and all that they entail "accessible to all".  </s>
<s> I will also address the other issue that you have just replied to in that I am not attacking microsoft or its supposed monopoly, I am just saying that if we look to include everyone (disabled, able, Mac, PC, computer literate, non-computer user, etc, etc) then these issues are important.  </s>
<s> I was using the Mac thing as an illustration of a point, not dissing MS nor anyone else either.  </s>
<s> I am interested in any software or hardware that can make websites accessible to all, but it still begs the question: why was the software not available across more platforms - perhaps Apple didn't want to help, perhaps no one was asked and MS just got in there first.  </s>
<s> There is no right or wrong in this discussion, I am only attempting to relate this thread to the overall accessibility issues that affect everyone on this list and a great many more.  </s>

<s> Key word: people.  </s>
<s> If Macromedia were "trying very hard" to make Flash accessible, then it would have been accessible and available on every platform long ago.  </s>
<s> What amazes me about reactions on this list is not that some people complain, but that others rush to defend mega-corporations for making trivial progress.  </s>
<s> Then again, the ability of human beings to live in denial of the obvious never ceases to astonish me.  </s>
<s> Here is a little story.  </s>
<s> Remember those old science fiction tales, the ones where humanity invents thinking machines and then the machines take over?  </s>
<s> The latest in the series were probably the Terminator movies.  </s>
<s> Well, those machines were invented several centuries ago, and perfected in the nineteenth century.  </s>
<s> And they've since taken over, though the process was so slow and gradual that most human beings grew to accept it as natural.  </s>
<s> The reason we have trouble recognizing that we are now slaves to our machines is because the machines in question have no physical form.  </s>
<s> They are abstract entities: legal machines.  </s>
<s> They are called corporations.  </s>
<s> Corporations are immortal.  </s>
<s> They have the same legal rights as a person, which means, in effect, that they have more legal rights than any person.  </s>
<s> They are predators, and the larger and stronger they grow, the more effectively they can crush any resistance and swallow up the competition.  </s>
<s> Corporations exist for only one purpose: to make a profit.  </s>
<s> They will destroy anything in their pursuit of profit, because they have no other values.  </s>
<s> In order to prevent or limit this destruction, they must be kept under control by strong governments, but now they have grown stronger than any government, and so the pace of destruction increases worldwide.  </s>
<s> Inside every corporation are people.  </s>
<s> Since corporations are inanimate, abstract entities, they must use people to have any effect at all.  </s>
<s> When corporations are still babies, those people may have some effect on the actions of the corporation.  </s>
<s> But when a corporation grows large, then the efforts of its people are overwhelmed by the sheer momentum of the corporation as a whole.  </s>
<s> If you think that this is a radical philosophy, then you are mistaken.  </s>
<s> It is not radical and it is not a philosophy.  </s>
<s> It is a simple statement (albeit a somewhat colorful one) of the truth.  </s>
<s> That Macromedia has come this short distance indicates that there are probably several people at Macromedia who've been working very hard to accomplish this.  </s>
<s> It is to those people, not to Macromedia the abstract legal entity, that we owe our thanks and support.  </s>
<s> Instead of ascribing the progress made to the machine, let's find out who at Macromedia is behind this progress and publicly thank them for what must have been a difficult struggle.  </s>
<s> We need to encourage people, not "corporations."  </s>
<s> And while we are encouraging those individuals who have fought to get the corporation to do something right, we should be chastizing the corporation itself (and corporations in general) for not doing enough.  </s>
<s> But then if we really want to change the world, we need to rethink corporations themselves.  </s>
<s> There is no reason that we can't create legal entities that will strive to better life for everyone on this planet.  </s>
<s> It's all in how they're constructed.  </s>
<s> A better world is possible.  </s>
<s> But given the remarkable ability of humans to live in denial, I'm not holding my breath.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Charles F. Munat Seattle, Washington  </s>
<s> I think what he wants is equal access.  </s>
<s> Poor fool!  </s>
<s> Doesn't he realize that being blind makes him a second or third class citizen, not entitled to the same rights that we superior sighted folks have?  </s>
