<s> No, I don't have authority over either group.  </s>
<s> And, I'll write CommArts for clarification.  </s>
<s> I probably should have slowed down before I posted that question, but when the article said the site was "accessible," I interpreted it to mean ADA compliant.  </s>
<s> And, I doubt that I'm the only one.  </s>
<s> Granted I'm more aware of such issues.  </s>
<s> I should ask whether the article's author made that assumption, or is the webmaster selling the site as accessible.  </s>
<s> It does have a "text only" link and haphazard alt tags.  </s>
<s> My concern, especially after the ADA hearing last week, is that there is a lot of misinformation or lack of information out there.  </s>
<s> I guess the question comes down to what "accessible" is?  </s>
<s> Does a site need to have the W3C/WAI and Bobby seal of approval?  </s>
<s> This is what I've been led to believe.  </s>
<s> Like some, I'm new to this field and am trying to get a handle on HTML coding, scripting languages, etc. Prior to this position, I managed three trade association sites with an HTML editor that was two years old.  </s>
<s> I had no clue that accessibility was even an issue.  </s>
<s> I'm also completing a Masters degree in Library &amp; Information Science and there are very few people in my field that are aware of this issue, and this is a community that is very attuned to traditional issues of access to information.  </s>
<s> I guess it comes down to the fact that we are all working hard to educate friends, colleagues, acquaintance, etc. about how accessibility should be achieved and how it benefits everyone.  </s>
<s> Just my two cents.  </s>

<s> Dear Editor, Your review (and selection of site of the week) of the Victoria's Secret site caused quite a stir on the "Web Accessible Initiative" interest group The discussion was over your article posted at URL: The problem is that your author wrote that the VS site was "accessible".  </s>
<s> What does she mean by that term?  </s>
<s> In the vernacular, "accessible" has become something of a buzz word that is free of semantic content.  </s>
<s> In the disability rights community, we take accessible to mean "functional for people who rely upon assistive technology".  </s>
<s> The VS site clearly does NOT fall into this category.  </s>
<s> Specifically, an "accessible" web site is one that satisfies the Priority 1 checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> The full (detailed) guidelines can be found at URL: The quick-and-easy "top ten" version is at URL: Please avoid the term "accessible" unless you mean it in this context.  </s>
<s> I would encourage you to report on accessibility (for persons with disabilities) and formal validity as part of your routine site review process.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if you would like further elaboration on these points.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Bruce Bailey Webmaster for the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) 410/554-9211  </s>
