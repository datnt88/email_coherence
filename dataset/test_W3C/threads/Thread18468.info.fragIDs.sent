<s> While this may seem like a new requirement, it is, in my  </s>
<s> opinion, an old, buried requirement.  </s>
<s> We require that all content be available through the user  </s>
<s> interface.  </s>
<s> We have also said that, because some users may not be able to access content when that content has  </s>
<s> been processed according to specification  </s>
<s> (e.g., scripts or style sheets), we require them to have access to the raw, unprocessed content.  </s>
<s> I think that we mean more than "a source view is probably a good idea as a last ditch solution".  </s>
<s> I think that we have meant: the user *must* be able to look at the source in case of emergency.  </s>
<s> I don't think that requiring a source view formally is a heavy burden since all user agents I am aware of do this anyway.  </s>
