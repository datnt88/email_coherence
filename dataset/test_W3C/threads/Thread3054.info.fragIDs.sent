<s> Is it possible to implement SSL or STLP for all winsock communications?  </s>
<s> For example, I would like to encrypt all FTP communication with a specific server, without depending on the FTP client application used.  </s>
<s> So - is this possible?  </s>
<s> Is there such an implementation?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Yonat.  </s>
<s> It depends on the SSL implementation.  </s>
<s> That means that you can't negotiate the use of SSL in the FTP protocol.  </s>
<s> So if the ftp server you're talking to does not do SSL, you will not be able to communicate.  </s>
<s> I think it's better to use the FTP options to negotiate SSL.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Not that I'm aware of.  </s>

<s> The actual implementation will allow arbitrary filters to be configured for specific types of connections for specific users and/or specific hosts.  </s>
