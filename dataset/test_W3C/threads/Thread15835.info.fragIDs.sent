<s> Well, FP's improved in later versions.  </s>
<s> I don't use it myself -- I don't use _any_ HTML authoring crutchHHHtool, save for vi/notepad/lemmy.  </s>
<s> However, my wife and I have basically discovered that whenever we find a really bad page -- it was almost always FrontPage generated.  </s>
<s> This may simply be a problem with user education rather than something the FP _programmers_ can fix.  </s>
<s> I dunno.  </s>
<s> Perhaps FrontPage and other tools make things a little _too_ easy?  </s>
<s> (Which goes against what I said previously, a little -- however I think that things should be easy _and_ produce good code.) As I said, FP is better than it was, and as I don't use it, I'm afraid I don't have any specifics that are worth passing along.  </s>

<s> Greetings, I can tell you all this: I spent the entire weekend fighting with FrontPage, trying to get it to import a page that was made originally with FP without messing up the formatting.  </s>
<s> I was completely unsuccessful.  </s>
<s> I have never had a positive experience with the import tool in FP, and, if one doesn't use one of the FP "themes," working with FP is quite difficult.  </s>
<s> Hi.. Funny, that is one of the things I thought needed more training to figure out, I found it unbelieveable that I lost my formatting ;/ Perhaps....FrontPage needs it's own mailing support list, is there one?  </s>
