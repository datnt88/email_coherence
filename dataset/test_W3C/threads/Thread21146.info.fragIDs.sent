<s> The GL version of 7.2 is not running on XP.  </s>
<s> Its process appears for a brief millisecond and immediately disappears.  </s>
<s> I tried turning off XP-style toolbars as well.  </s>

<s> Hi folks who have trouble with the windows 32 bits version.  </s>
<s> The problem comes from the double dot used in the name of the software (.2.exe) For my part i had the ability to add the .2.exe as a binary extension inside an external download manager and i am running Amaya 7.2 on Windows XP very well.  </s>
<s> Irene : please remember for the next version not to include a double dot :-)  </s>

<s> On Tue, 4 Feb 2003 01:32:16 +0100 The problem with the GL version on XP was due to missing files in initial Windows distributions.  </s>
<s> Of course it worked for people that have the previous version still installed.  </s>
<s> Since the beginning of our distributions nobody else reported a problem with several dots within our distribution file names.  </s>
<s> It's not a problem for us to change that, but are you sure we need to change?  </s>

<s> Dear Irene, I had this trouble with my own dowload but if nobody else had problem with this there is no reason to change.  </s>
<s> Perhaps was it only a trouble with my download manager because i had to set the double dot as a binary.  </s>
