<s> Hi, First of all, I can't answer questions about Amaya on Windows if these questions are not sent to www-amaya mailing list.  </s>
<s> There is no function in ThotLib allowing to load ".bmp" files.  </s>
<s> However you you can add such functionality.  </s>
<s> The onlything to do is to identify the bmp file and to use the Windows API to load and display bitmaps.  </s>
<s> 1. Get the bits of the bitmap from the ".bmp" file, 2. Use one of the functions in Windows API To create a bitmap (CreateBitmap, CreateCompatibleBitmap, etc.) See WIN_MakeImage function in gifhandler.c  </s>
