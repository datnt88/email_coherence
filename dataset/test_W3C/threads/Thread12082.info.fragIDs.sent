<s> Interesting... In fact I've just started to adopt the pair "at minimum - ideally" for specifications and similar I write (or add commnets to) for Macromedia.  </s>
<s> And pointed this out to my colleagues as a nice, "human-readable" way to distinguish priority levels...  </s>
<s> I think it's important to make a difference between WAI guidelines and techniques.  </s>
<s> Guidelines, if well formulated, do *not* tell anyone "how" to implement something, just a minimal requirement for functionality.  </s>
<s> "At minimum" in this context should indicate that such functionality should -somehow- be provided; if not, there is no conformance.  </s>
<s> If you're talking about a "more advanced solution", then "solution" means technique to me.  </s>
<s> As long as that implementation technique meets the functional requirement of the "at minimum" in the guideline, it conforms.  </s>
<s> As I see it, "at minimum" would not lower the bar in any way.  </s>
<s> It just tells you what you have to conform to - not how.  </s>
<s> We still have P1. P2 and P3. Well formulated, "at minimum" would be the same for all products, not something totally different for different products.  </s>
<s> Example: If we say that "at minimum" you have to provide a way to navigate the structure of the document being edited, that does not tell anyone how to do that.  </s>
<s> A structure view would be a nice solution, but find-find again would work, too (just not as nice).  </s>
<s> Short comments below.  </s>
<s> A minimum is just that.  </s>
<s> You are always free to have a "higher" standard.  </s>
<s> Yes. Techniques give only suggestions for how something could be implemented.  </s>
<s> Only guidelines should use "at minimum".  </s>
<s> Well-formulated guidelines apply to all technologies they say they apply to.  </s>
<s> An advanced solution would implement the minimum.  </s>

<s> unquote this is a very real danger inherent in the concept of explicitly stating a minimal satisfactory implementation of a checkpoint, and yet, when WAI guidelines (such as the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) do not contain explicit requirements for minimally satisfying a checkpoint, the working groups have received requests from developers, claiming that the affiliated Techniques documents, due to their informative/non-normative status, cannot sufficiently address what is minimally required to satisfy a particular checkpoint... so, while i share your concern about the potential straitjacketing effect normative minimal requirements may have upon developers, there is also a clear need to define normatively what exactly constitutes minimal satisfaction of the checkpoint in question... for example, what use would it be to simply state that a user agent MUST offer a search facility, if the basic parameters for a search facility aren't explicitly stated? the ability to search is the absolute minimum, but the ability to search is quite an amorphous concept, so the base functionality necessary for a UAAG conformance claim is spelled out explictly in the User Agent Guidelines [reference 1] as for your last point, quote Will products have to implement "the minimum" even if they have "an advanced" solution?  </s>
<s> unquote, while the answer is, "yes", the reply is not as onerous as one might assume... i know from my experience as a member of the User Agent working group that what the UA WG intends by expressing minimal requirements for checkpoints is to express the functionality necessary to minimally satisfy the checkpoint, and NOT the mechanism whereby the functionality is achieved -- that, as you correctly point out, is fodder for the Techniques document... granted, in order to express the minimal functionality required by a checkpoint, it may be necessary to more explicitly reference specific markup languages, but where the User Agent WG found it necessary to explicitly state base functionality with reference to a specific markup language or modality, the minimal requirements are References 1. http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/  </s>

<s> unquote i am loathe to let my (and others') cynical opinion of human nature lead me to the ironclad conclusion that the "default" reaction to minimal requirements will be to use them as a lazyman's loophole... so, while i agree that there is a very real danger inherent in the concept of explicitly stating a minimal satisfactory implementation of a checkpoint, that isn't what is under discussion... what the "at a minimum" clauses are intended to provide is a description of the absolute base functionality required by the checkpoint, and realpolitik dictates that the dangers of not explictly outlining base functionality for a checkpoint far outweigh the dangers of either providing a loophole for lazy developers by forcing them, at the very least, to provide well-defined functionality... minimal requirements don't dictate the implementation details of the required functionality -- they merely define what base functionality MUST be available to the user... moreover, when WAI guidelines (such as the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) do not contain explicit requirements for minimally satisfying a checkpoint, the working groups have received requests from developers, claiming that the affiliated Techniques documents, due to their informative/non-normative status, cannot sufficiently address what is minimally required to satisfy a particular checkpoint... so, while i share your concern about the potential straitjacketing effect normative minimal requirements may have upon developers, there is also a clear need to define normatively what exactly constitutes minimal satisfaction of the checkpoint in question, as well as the need for providing context for the checkpoint... for example, what use would it be to simply state that a user agent MUST offer a search facility, if the basic parameters for a search facility aren't explicitly stated? the ability to search is the absolute minimum, but the ability to search is quite an amorphous concept, so the base functionality necessary for a UAAG conformance claim is spelled out explictly in the User Agent Guidelines [reference 1] as for your last point, quote Will products have to implement "the minimum" even if they have "an advanced" solution?  </s>
