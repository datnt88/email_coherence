<s> using the XPath 2.0 grammar checker at 1 the parser widget emits: |XPath2 | XPath | Expr | ExprSingle | InstanceofExpr | TreatExpr | CastableExpr | CastExpr | UnaryExpr | PathExpr | StepExpr | FilterStep | IntegerLiteral 1 | Predicates - why is this here ?? Parsing the same expression using the XPath 2.0 EBNF (2may03) however should produce the following: XPath Expr ExprSingle OrExpr - so what happened to this? andExpr - and this?  </s>
<s> instanceOfExpr treatExpr castableExpr castExpr comparisonExpr - and this rangeExpr - and this additiveExpr - and this multiplicativeExpr - and this unaryExpr - and this unionExpr intersectExceptExpr - and this valueExpr - and this pathExpr relativePathExpr - and this stepExpr filterStep primaryExpr - and this literalExpr - and this numericExpr - and this integerExpr As well, I get 404's on the two links to the BNF's.  </s>

<s> I actually throw away everything myself except the leaves, which makes it extremely easy to see whether you've actually built the structure you think you have, given a particular query.  </s>
<s> In the extreme case I believe it's the difference between an AST and a parse tree (tho I never remember which is which).  </s>
<s> I just wasn't sure why some of your intermediates were kept and others not.  </s>
