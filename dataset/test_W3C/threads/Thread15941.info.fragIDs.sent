<s> I am trying to use properly nested H1, H2, tags for accessibility and indexing reasons.  </s>
<s> The problem I keep running into is that I would like to avoid a blank line below the heading.  </s>
<s> In the past I have avoided these tags for just this reason.  </s>
<s> I have tried everything I could think of to get rid of that blank line, but to no avail.  </s>
<s> Anyone know a way to get around it?  </s>
<s> I have the same problem with P tags.  </s>
<s> I've been using DIV with BR tags to avoid P tags because I don't want the spaces above and below.  </s>
<s> I am trying to achieve a look in which the first paragraph has a drop cap and no indent, and subsequent paragraphs have a first line indent, the way it is normally done in print.  </s>
<s> The "block" format gets old.  </s>
<s> I know that CSS CAN do it, but is there anyway to make it work in the current browsers that "support" CSS?  </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated.  </s>

<s> Hi Charles,  </s>
<s> You can get the indents... but it's not considered "good" html code.  </s>
<s> Here are two different ways: 1. starting a paragraph with DD 2. starting the paragraph with a bunch of &amp;nbsp;'s ... so you can do &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is my second paragraph.  </s>
<s> Of course, the third option is to try the "single-pixel" gif trick.... but, that's not good design either!  </s>

<s> FrontPage 98 (make sure you have the update patch installed) allows for the double spaces between sentences.  </s>
<s> HoTMetaL 4.0 does not.  </s>
<s> The only problem I've encountered with this technique is the old AOL proprietary browser (2.0 maybe) didn't recognize &amp;nbsp; and showed it as such in the document.  </s>
<s> However, it is important enough to me attempt to use proper English that I use the technique anyway.  </s>
<s> For the few users using the old AOL browser they just end up with a little bit garbage.  </s>
<s> The word to HTML conversion utility doesn't seem to save the double spaces nor does pasting from the clipboard to FrontPage98.  </s>
<s> I don't know about the use of CSS to achieve this.  </s>
<s> Our user base doesn't have full enough support for CSS to justify its use yet so I haven't studied it.  </s>

<s> From a design point of view, HTML documents are more like typeset documents than like typewritten ones.  </s>
<s> In typesetting, one usually leaves only one space at the end of a sentence; the two spaces in typing are to compensate for the weird look of monospaced type.  </s>
<s> TeX applies an algorithm for finding the end of sentences, and slightly increases the spaces there, but not to a full double space.  </s>
<s> I'd recommend avoiding fooling with hard spaces and let the browser do its best job.  </s>

<s> I've been tinkering for the past few weeks with my personal web site.  </s>
<s> The objective has been to explore a variety of issues, particularly accessiblity and coincidentally style sheets and frames and tables.  </s>
<s> As I've been reading the remarks of this group for a month or so, I've been slowly coming to the conclusion that there is no single answer.  </s>
<s> What I've done so far is at a rather simple level.  </s>
<s> But that's where I need to start.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to find as broad an answer as possible.  </s>
<s> I've neutered many of the links on the main menu because the pages behind them won't contribute to my immediate quest.  </s>
<s> The "Carnival" and "About" pages are working.  </s>
<s> If you have time, I'd appreciate any remarks you might have about this.  </s>
<s> I'd be especially interested to hear from anyone who's come up with a way to create a "back" button that works across a wider spectrum.  </s>
<s> This charming old trick doesn't seem to work very well.  </s>

<s> Interesting that you should be amused by web pages that emulate print documents, but you want to put two spaces after periods.  </s>
<s> As someone else already mentioned, I think, the added space is there to increase readability when using monospaced typewriter fonts.  </s>
<s> When using a proportional font, the extra space is not used.  </s>
<s> This reminds me of an English professor I once had who insisted that papers be typewritten, not printed with proportional fonts, because he said the typewritten pages were easier to read.  </s>
<s> That would have come as a shock to a great many experts on type.  </s>
<s> I agree that emulation of print documents is not always desirable and often impractical.  </s>
<s> But there are also times when the traditional print format is appropriate.  </s>
<s> And it's nice to have the option.  </s>
<s> Thus, for example, the inclusion of drop caps in the CSS standard.  </s>
<s> An attempt, I believe, to get happy results.  </s>
<s> I don't often use drop caps, but when I do I've usually been forced to use the image and alt text route, although not always GIFs and not always monochrome.  </s>
<s> Charles Munat Puerto Vallarta  </s>
<s> It was my own acknowledged print-oriented hypocrisy that made me bring up spaces when I commented on your drop cap question!  </s>
<s> I am debating the double-space after sentences with two other people off the list (less we repeat the un-resolvable emoticon debate).  </s>
<s> The problem is that most word processors and browsers are NOT smart enough to lengthen the gap between sentences (vice the gap between words) which IS commonly done in type setting.  </s>
<s> The jury is ambivalent on this issues.  </s>
<s> Please reference URL: I will offer this food for though up to the group: If I expect a significant number of my visitors to be using Lynx (without a screen reader) and thus a mono spaced font, should I not defer to a convention that helps them a lot but hurts others very little?  </s>
<s> Have you found a solution to this?  </s>
<s> I am having the same problem.  </s>
<s> I need to use Hn text for search engine indexing purposes, but I cannot get rid of the space that follows beneath the text.  </s>
<s> I have tried using stylesheets, but I am not yet adept at them.  </s>
<s> Please tell me how to use headers and remove the following space.  </s>
