<s> Hans, I would think of it as more than a repair strategy for bad interface design, though it also serves that purpose.  </s>
<s> People with different types of disability may need different control interfaces.  </s>
<s> For example, a person with limited ROM might want the frequent controls close together.  </s>
<s> A person with poor motor control might want them farther apart.  </s>
<s> Allowing the user to configure the location of controls allows both users to create an interface that works for them.  </s>
<s> (By the way, a "skin creator" feature would probably meet this requirement, and be a mass-market feature as well.) Denis Behalf Of Hans Riesebos Strange that I never saw this before, but isn't this a repair strategy for a badly designed UI of the UA!?  </s>
