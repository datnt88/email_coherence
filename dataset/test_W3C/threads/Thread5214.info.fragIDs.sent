<s> Ok, I can see what's happening now.  </s>
<s> OWLSReader_1_0 still does getProperty(OWLS_1_0.Process.theProperty)  </s>
<s> But in owls/vocabulary/jena/OWLS_1_0.java, theProperty is defined to be "theParameter": public static Property theProperty = ResourceFactory.createProperty(URI,  </s>

<s> The problems about reading composite service descriptions were fixed in the SVN and now there is a new release of the API that contains these bug fixes along with more code examples and a small tutorial.  </s>
