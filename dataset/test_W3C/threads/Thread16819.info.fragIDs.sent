<s> Hi Jim,  </s>
<s> A good piece - your have a reasonable point and argue it well.  </s>
<s> On the  </s>
<s> downside I would say that it only gives part of the story.  </s>
<s> You make the  </s>
<s> point that using e.g. SPAN rather than H1 for things that are headers is  </s>
<s> lacking something, though you don't actually pin down what it is.  </s>
<s> IMHO, I'd say that thing was metadata, that h1 should be considered more important than h2 and so on.  </s>
<s> It can be reasonably argued that the use of 'legacy' HTML 3.2 markup is one way of providing such information, and I think that is  </s>
<s> essentially what you do in this piece.  </s>
<s> Another way may be to use named classes, like "tophead" in your example, though of course it would be better if they came from well-known vocabularies - class="h1" perhaps?  </s>
<s> Hopefully in years to come the W3C's activities in the region of metadata will develop  </s>
<s> and provide a consistent, simple approach to situations like this, and we won't need to rely on a vocabulary of maybe two dozen terms plus fairly  </s>
<s> arbitrary nesting rules to explain our document's structure (at this point  </s>
<s> somebody reminds me of a standard that does this already ;-).  </s>
<s> For now at least, I reckon what you've written makes good pragmatic sense.  </s>

<s> I think this impression might be mainly caused by the subtitle-like text "Top ten accessibility problems created by use and misuse of CSS", which now appears in the "breadcrumbs" and pointing to which points (via redirection) to the page itself.  </s>
<s> Reflexive links (i.e., a link that points to the page itself) are confusing, and using different URLs  </s>
<s> adds to the confusion, since a browser initially treats it as unvisited link  </s>
<s> (since the _URL_ has not been visited).  </s>
<s> Maybe it's intended to become a structural link that points to a page with links to nine other articles?  </s>
<s> But despite such problems, and other (minor) problems in the accessibility of the page itself, like using alt="Decorative photo: white flowers."  </s>
<s> instead of alt="" title="Decorative photo: white flowers.",  </s>
<s> I found the page very good, too.  </s>
<s> I'm biased, in a sense, since I've presented similar points for years, e.g. in my article "Lurching Toward Babel: HTML, CSS, and XML" in "Computer" in July 1998, (Yes, in PDF format!  </s>
<s> Not my choice.)  </s>
<s> You make the point that using e.g. SPAN rather than H1 for things that are headers is lacking something, though you don't actually pin down what  </s>
<s> it  </s>
<s> I think the article presents that fairly well - it points out that SPAN lacks a defined meaning that could be adequately processed by programs, such as indexing robots, speech synthesis, browsers applying user style sheets, etc.  </s>
<s> And let's not forget browsers with CSS turned off (or not supported at all).  </s>
<s> What does SPAN degrade to?  </s>
<s> Nothing.  </s>
<s> There's no reason why SPAN markup per se should be processed in any particular way.  </s>
<s> For example, when headings are adequately marked up, a browser that generates speech can pause before a heading, read it slowly, pause, and continue its normal (fast) speed.  </s>
<s> This makes the document _much_ clearer and  </s>
<s> easier to listen; it is comparable to using spacing and large fonts in  </s>
<s> visual presentation.  </s>
<s> A browser could not, and should not, do anything like that with SPAN , even if the tag has class="otsikko" or class="rubrik" (or even class="heading" - it would be quite unappropriate for a browser to make guesses based on what some string might mean in some particular natural language).  </s>
<s> Sure, you could write an aural style sheet for some SPAN s.  </s>
<s> Even in principle, it would solve just small part of the problem.  </s>
<s> In practice, when did you last see a browser supporting aural style sheets?  </s>
<s> Besides, trying to cover _all_ the possible presentation environments by writing style sheets for them is an endless task.  </s>
<s> Some browsers use one font only but variation in font color to indicate major structural ingredients like headings.  </s>
<s> They do it automatically, as long as you use appropriate markup; but you can't make them do that for your SPAN s.  </s>
<s> IMHO, I'd say that thing was metadata  </s>
<s> In a sense, all markup is metadata, data about data.  </s>
<s> But I don't think this view is particularly useful.  </s>
<s> What we normally call metadata in the WWW context is data about such data that consists of entire documents like an HTML document and associated images etc., i.e. "Web pages".  </s>
<s> No, class="h1" does not mean anything more (to a browser) than class="foo".  </s>
<s> The class name is just an assigned symbol with no intrinsic meaning.  </s>
<s> Things might change if we defined some specific rules for class names, with semantic definitions (e.g., "h1" means 'first level heading') and published them and got wide acceptance.  </s>
<s> Then we would have reinvented the wheel, wouldn't we?  </s>
<s> It would be just like HTML, except more clumsy.  </s>
<s> It was one of the basic weaknesses of HTML as originally defined that it had only a handful of markup elements you can use.  </s>
<s> But it was also one of its fundamental strengths.  </s>
<s> The smaller the set of markup elements that a program _must_ recognize and process in some particular way, the easier it is to write programs that process marked-up data, for visible or audible presentation or for other purposes.  </s>
<s> (Actually, a qualified programmer could write a browser for HTML 2.0 in an hour, a _different_ browser that has some special treatment for markup like headings, to suit the properties of some new device, or the needs of some particular people.) And the ease of  </s>
<s> creating "different" user agents is essential to accessibility.  </s>

<s> Jukka, I agree, the 'breadcrumb' links are generated automatically - and this one went astray - I've fixed it.  </s>

<s> Agreed, markup is essentially metadata, and IMO acknowledging this can be very useful.  </s>
<s> (Who is this 'we', BTW?) A lot of people are seeing the value of finer-grained explicit metadata (e.g. the use of the metadata element in SVG), or even the use of metadata describing completely arbitrary resources (e.g. RDF).  </s>
<s> Depends on the browser - ok, there aren't any browsers I know of that would understand this, but I was making the point that use of common vocabularies could be referenced in other ways than by using HTML 3.2 syntax.  </s>
<s> My point exactly (apart from the clumsiness bit).  </s>
<s> Ok, I've got 6 'O' levels, and could probably hack together a browser in an hour, with special handling of some form or other.  </s>
<s> I think it would be a waste of an hour though - the strengths of HTML (and HTTP) that got the web going aren't necessarily the same ones that will keep it going (and developing).  </s>
<s> And the ease of  </s>
