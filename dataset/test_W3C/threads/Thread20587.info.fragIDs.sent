<s> Just tried using the 6.3 version of Amaya (static libraries) on Linux.  </s>
<s> Amaya crashes when I open the drop down menu Style and select Format.  </s>
<s> Other options, Charactor, Color, Background seem to work just fine.  </s>

<s> Hello Anthony, I have downloaded this version of Amaya but I can't reproduce the crash.  </s>
<s> Does it happen systematically or, if not, have you a precise scenario to reproduce it ?  </s>
<s> Otherwise, could you execute Amaya under gdb and send me the trace when it crashes ?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Laurent  </s>
<s> Hello Anthony,  </s>
<s> You tried the Motif version (static library) of Amaya on Linux, right ?  </s>
<s> Laurent  </s>
<s> Hum, Amaya loads a specific font to display that Format selector.  </s>
<s> That could be the cause of the crash.  </s>
<s> Could you execute in a xterm "xset fp" then "xset q" to see what font paths are available before the operation and another "xset q" after the operation.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
