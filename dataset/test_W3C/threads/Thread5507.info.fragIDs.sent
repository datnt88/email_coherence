<s> My appologies if I should know the answers to these questions: 1. http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes, this is an *authoritative* list of *approved* URI schemes, yes?  </s>
<s> 2. is there an *authoritiative* procedure by which a proposed scheme is added to this list?  </s>
<s> 3. Is there an *authoritiative* list of *proposed* schemes that are undergoing this approval process?  </s>
<s> Thank you, and again my appologies, as I should probably know the answers to these questions, but I don't.  </s>

<s> I think what would come closest to this is the IETF draft tracker at https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi.  </s>

<s> Just a thought...  </s>
<s> Recently, a proposal [1] for registering message header fields was approved as BCP (yet to be published as RFC), which provides for a "provisional" registry as a way to address this kind of issue.  </s>
<s> Maybe consider something similar for URI schemes?  </s>
<s> I note an argument against this is that it might appear to encourage a proliferation of URI schemes, which would have costs not associated with message headers.  </s>
