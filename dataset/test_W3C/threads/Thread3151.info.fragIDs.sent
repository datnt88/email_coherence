<s> Chaals raises the issue of merging different vocabularies.  </s>
<s> I think that that is a different issue and raises many other complications, but as he says the extra verification or disambiguation step that I have described above applies there too.  </s>
<s> As the present SKOS draft doesn't cover questions of mapping between vocabularies, I think we should keep it to what is necessary and desirable for a single vocabulary.  </s>
<s> I think 'merging' and 'mapping' are completely different scenarios.  </s>
<s> In mapping, the schemes are kept separate, and linked via mapping statements.  </s>
<s> In merging, a new scheme is created by combining concepts from different sources.  </s>
<s> It's worth considering the situations where separate groups of people (part of a larger community) are responsible for contributing concepts as part of a larger scheme.  </s>
<s> In this scenario we may expect to find overlap of labels.  </s>

<s> Before you merge them, you may have to undertake a mapping operation in order to resolve conflicts and inconsistencies.  </s>
<s> A label may be associated with different concepts in the part-thesauri being mapped together.  </s>
<s> Once you have merged the contributions into a whole, each label in the single resulting thesaurus should be unique.  </s>
<s> This should therefore be a requirement of a scheme of encoding any single thesaurus, it seems to me.  </s>

<s> Clearly Leonard and I (and to some extent Alistair and I) are currently looking from different perspectives.  </s>
<s> I don't see any point in a mapping unless it is to allow use of two vocabularies as if they are merged (an artifact of RDF is that as soon as we have a mapping we can treat these things as merged).  </s>
<s> As I understand it one of the important features of the work is the ability to do this mapping (although it isn't kept in the same namespace, it is a requirement, and it is certainly the basis of my interest in this).  </s>
<s> I maintain that one of the use cases that makes the SKOS work interesting is the parallel work on mapping, and that we should ensure that we don' break this.  </s>
<s> I therefore think that we should separate what we consider Best Practice (for example having the same label as possibly referring to two concepts is generally a bad idea) from making something absolutely incorrect when there is reason to believe that it will arise in practice due to sensible work.  </s>
<s> So I would continue to suppport the idea that things are "strong usage recommendations" (but not encoded in the ontology definition frameworks), rather than seeking to outlaw them by specifying appropriate RDF/OWL constraints.  </s>

<s> This conversation is making me nervous about the misunderstandings that arise when we use our own terminology imprecisely.  </s>
<s> By "mapping" I mean setting up a relationship between terms or codes that represent concepts in different vocabularies.  </s>
<s> By "merging" I mean taking two or more vocabularies and making them into one vocabulary.  </s>
<s> (For this purpose I would make use of any mappings that were available).  </s>
<s> But the most obvious applications of mappings do not involve merging.  </s>
<s> For example, you can use mappings to translate metadata descriptions from one vocabulary to another.  </s>
<s> Or you can use them to translate Search statements from one vocabulary to another.  </s>
<s> You can do either of these without building a merged vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Any of the applications will work much better if the people who built the vocabularies and the mappings followed the guidelines (e.g. ISO 2788) rigorously while doing it.  </s>
<s> Between 2 different vocabularies, you can and should expect to find one label applying to 2 different concepts.  </s>
<s> But within one thesaurus, it is straightforward to require each term to be unique, and not an unreasonable requirement.  </s>
