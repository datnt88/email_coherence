<s> from yesterday's Guardian (Sight Aid): we hope that http://www.peepo.com  </s>
<s> might be the first accessible web portal that they list.  </s>
<s> however as many of the sites we link to are not accessible to their users, this may not be appropriate.  </s>
<s> Accessible portal designers eat concrete for breakfast :-)  </s>

<s> You missed the irony alert: blue text on a blue background both top-right and top-left, and a classic case of presentational markup without structure (there's not even a Heading).  </s>
<s> Redeemed by simplicity, insofar as it might as well be plain text.  </s>
<s> Hmmm, too subtle for me, I'm afraid.  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Nick. top right and left are images, they are blue text, but on a light fawn (complementary?) background, where is the light blue?  </s>
<s> I'll forward your comments regarding use of 'Heading' as that is a help.  </s>
<s> thanks Jonathan FYI: creating an accessible portal can be a problem, and if one limits oneself to only linking to accessible websites it could become a headache.  </s>
<s> Similar then to eating concrete for breakfast, constipating.  </s>
<s> Of course, it does depend on the audience, W3C doesn't have a problem.  </s>
<s> We try to have fun at http://www.peepo.com, and do!  </s>
<s> Light fawn?  </s>
<s> Only if (I presume) you load images.  </s>
<s> Both of them are links, and I had to faff around to ascertain that they weren't something I wanted to follow.  </s>
<s> Comment applies to any site, but this one sets out to be explicitly for the visually impaired!  </s>
<s> We've already got their published address in a Cc: Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Nick, I seem to be missing something here: The Alt-content font size on my system XP-IE is very small when images are turned off, how does one make this bigger?  </s>
<s> On my system it seems to be about half the size of the font used for most of the W3.org homepage.  </s>
<s> Alternatively say on mozilla, or mac IE mozilla safari or other?  </s>
<s> In IE the tooltip font is configurable, but does not popup from the keyboard, this has been requested more than once.  </s>
<s> Should the browser offer the option to automatically provide a complement to the background for alt text?  </s>
<s> or are you suggesting that a dark background is never to be used?  </s>
<s> thanks Jonathan  </s>
