<s> I have spent a little time working on a sidebar for the Mozilla browser to display Annotea annotations.  </s>
<s> As you may know, Mozilla handles RDF itself, so it is possible to retrieve the RDF from the annotations server and manipulate it directly in Javascript.  </s>
<s> However, this seems to require that the data is served with a content type of "text/rdf", not "text/xml" as it is currently (if the "forceText" option is used).  </s>
<s> Is there any chance that an option could be added to serve the results as text/rdf?  </s>

<s> Mozilla's a little ahead of itself here, since there is no such content type (and may never be).  </s>
<s> Perhaps the Annotea server could be tweaked to  </s>
<s> allow some chosen content type to be specified as part of the URL?  </s>
<s> (eg.  </s>
<s> &amp;t=text/rdf appended...).  </s>
<s> Hacky but might allow for some interesting  </s>
<s> prototypes.  </s>
<s> Anyway, if you make your code available, let me know and I'll link it from the Mozilla page at http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/SmartBrowsing.html too... Dan  </s>
<s> Would you consider that a bug in Mozilla?  </s>
<s> Should I raise it?  </s>
