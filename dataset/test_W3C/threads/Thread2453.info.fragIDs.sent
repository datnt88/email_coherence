<s> Here's the ID that I just submitted to the IETF under the name draft-frystyk-http-mandatory I have also made it available as "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/ietf-http-ext/draft-frystyk-http-mandatory -00.txt" so that we at least can point to it.  </s>

<s> Sorry - WRONG LIST :( I should have sent it to ietf-http-ext@w3.org - sorry for the trouble.  </s>
<s> PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THIS DRAFT TO THIS LIST! Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> Why does this spec insist on being more than one paragraph long?  </s>
<s> All we need is a "Mandatory" header followed by the names of header fields that MUST be understood.  </s>
<s> That is it.  </s>
<s> No fancy namespaces, no extensions, NOTHING.  </s>
<s> Now if you want to add those fancy features, fine, define a "fancy-features" header and PUT ITS NAME IN MANDATORY.  </s>
<s> While we are at it, what happened to the section on changing method names to "PEP-*"?  </s>
<s> We need this if we are ever going to deploy.  </s>
<s> All this having been said I want to congratulate Henrik et all on really paring down the spec.  </s>
<s> It is much better than before.  </s>
<s> With just a little more cutting we will finally have something we can deploy.  </s>
