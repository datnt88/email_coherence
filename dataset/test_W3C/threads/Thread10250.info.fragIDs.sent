<s> 3/ rdfs:label rdfs:range rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> Now in addition we have that ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal) ) is a subset of LV. Also in datatyped interpretations, all datatype classes are subclasses ofICEXT(I rdfs:Literal)).  </s>
<s> So I think that this covers your problems, except as noted below.  </s>
<s> No. Now typed literals are handled somewhat better, but untyped literals are still rather strange, because the denotation of "a" is not necessarily in CEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)).  </s>
<s> True, it is not necessarily in that class extension.  </s>
<s> Why does that bother you?  </s>
<s> There is no way in any piece of RDF syntax to assert that it (or any other particular literal) is or is not in that class, so to impose a semantic condition which cannot be expressed axiomatically would serve no purpose other than to guarantee incompleteness of any inference system.  </s>
<s> Well, so what?  </s>
<s> Is this any different than the situation with respect to RDF datatypes?  </s>
<s> How is this any different from the situation with respect to rdf:XMLLiteral?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that if you can handle rdf:XMLLiteral you should be able to handle untyped literals being in CEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)).  </s>
<s> Well, we could handle them, as you put it, by insisting that ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) = LV.  </s>
<s> I did consider that alternative, and it would be easy to make the modification.  </s>
<s> I presume you would prefer that.  </s>
<s> If you want OWL to have that extra condition (eg that ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) = LV, say) then OWL is free to add that as an extra condition.  </s>
<s> Until RDF syntax provides some way to have literals as ubjects, however, I would recommend against it.  </s>
<s> (IF RDF did have literals as subjects I would have had the class rdfs:Literal tightly defined from the very start.)  </s>
<s> Right now the situation is very unusual with respect to literals in RDF.  </s>
<s> In RDFS, the following is not valid ex:john ex:foo "a" .  </s>
<s> entails ex:john ex:foo :_a .  </s>
<s> :_a rdf:type rdfs:Literal .  </s>
<s> but any datatype entailment that includes a datatype that has the string "a" in its value space (even if the lexical-to-value mapping does not map the syntactic construct "a" to this string) the entailment follows.  </s>
<s> True.  </s>
<s> I guess I see a kind of sense to this situation, but perhaps I was being too finicky.  </s>
<s> It would certainly be more coherent, as it were, if untyped literals were treated similarly to typed literals with a kind of built-in trivial datatype whose lexical space was literals and whose L2V mapping was identity.  </s>
<s> OK, let us assume that change will be made before publication.  </s>
<s> Then all plain literals and all well-formed typed literals denote something in rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> In the LCC document, datatypes are still broken.  </s>
<s> For starters, the document is inconsistent with respect to just what is a datatype; sometimes it is a member of the domain, sometimes it is a URIref.  </s>
<s> I have not detected that inconsistency, can you point me at where it occurs?  </s>
<s> The document uses datatype urirefs to refer to datatypes, which seems consistent to me.  </s>
<s> The intent is that recognized datatypes are always members of the domain.  </s>
<s> Then how do you justify The set of recognized datatypes always includes rdf:XMLLiteral in Section 3.4?  </s>
<s> Er.. What kind of justification do you need?  </s>
<s> rdf:XMLLiteral *is* a member of the domain, that follows from the general assumption that URIrefs always denote.  </s>
<s> The quote that you want justified is supposed to be part of the definition of 'recognized', not a lemma that needs to be established.  </s>
<s> I didnt say 'rdf:XMLLiteral' was a member of the domain, notice (though it is, as a matter of fact.)  </s>
<s> The treatment of rdf:XMLLiteral is very suspect, for example what happens to "a"^^ex:foo if I(rdf:XMLLiteral) = I(ex:foo)?  </s>
<s> If that identity holds (which would be rather extraordinary) then ex:foo would in fact be rdf:XMLLiteral, ie owl:sameIndividualAs ex:foo rdf:XMLLiteral .  </s>
<s> would be true.  </s>
<s> So in that case indeed, the typed literal you have written would have the same value as "a"^^rdf:XMLLiteral in that interpretation.  </s>
<s> Not according to the RDF model theory.  </s>
<s> In this model theory rdf:XMLLiteral is handled very differently than other datatypes.  </s>
<s> The intention is that it should be handled exactly similarly (apart from the lang tags complication) .  </s>
<s> But I see that there is a crack, indeed, since I do not define L2V for XML literals.  </s>
<s> See below.  </s>
<s> rdf:XMLLiteral is handled (in Section 3.1) by if xxx is a well-formed XML document, then IL("xxx"^^rdf:XMLLiteral) is the XML canonical form of xxx Other datatypes are (very awkwardly) handled in Section 3.4, by ... satisfies the following extra conditions on all datatypes other than the built-in datatype: For any typed literal "sss"^ddd or "sss"@ttt^^ddd, if I(ddd) is in D and 'sss' is a valid lexical form for I(ddd) then IL("sss"^^ddd) = L2V(ddd)(sss) (By the way, this appears to imply that the only lexical forms that matter are ones that start and stop with a single quote.  </s>
<s> Yes, the use of those single quotes is a mistake, I will remove those.  </s>
<s> And you are right, I should have said IL("sss"^^ddd) = IL("sss"@ttt^^ddd) = L2V(ddd)(sss), an editorial slip, sorry.  </s>
<s> Also, this is missing the interpretation of "sss"@ttt^^ddd.)  </s>
<s> So "a"^^ex:foo falls through the cracks.  </s>
<s> It doesn't match the conditions in Section 3.1 because it has the wrong URI ref and it doesn't match the conditions in Section 3.4 because they don't hold for I(rdf:XMLLiteral).  </s>
<s> They do if the L2V mapping of rdf:XMLLiteral is defined properly.  </s>
<s> I see that there is a editorial crack here, in that I do not mention the L2V mapping when describing rdf:XMLLiteral, since the concept of a lexical-to-value mapping is not introduced until the section on datatyping.  </s>
<s> This needs to be fixed, indeed, but its purely an expository point.  </s>
<s> (The reason for this is the decision, taken rather late in the day, to treat XML literals as a built-in datatype rather than a syntactically distinct form of literal.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately this screws up the expository structure of the document somewhat.)  </s>
<s> Of course, there is no way in RDF(S) or even OWL-DL to establish such an identity, so the question only makes sense in OWL-Full.  </s>
<s> I have no problems with this, myself.  </s>
<s> The translation into Lbase is still broken with respect to rdf:XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> Can you be more specific?  </s>
<s> TR("sss"@ttt^^rdf:XMLLiteral) = L2V(TR["sss"],TR[ddd]) which incorrectly ignores the language tag I have pointed this out at least one before in a message to w3c-rdfcore-wg  </s>
<s> Right, sorry.  </s>
<s> There is at least one version in which this has been fixed, but it might have got lost in the last-minute document flurry.  </s>
<s> Mia culpa.  </s>
<s> The best version of the translation gives the explicit translation from Jeremy's document for each distinct type of literal, which is obviously what should have been done in the first place.  </s>

<s> I get very uneasy when formal tokens are written down as if they stood in for their denotation.  </s>
<s> What happens if there are two interpretations under consideration, for example?  </s>
<s> The text of the RDF Semantics document sometimes uses tokens of the form aa:bb as if they meant URI references, e.g., ``IEXT(I(rdf:subject)'', and sometimes as if they meant elements of domain, e.g., ``the rdf:subject property''.  </s>

<s> If an editor gets a comment and thinks that can be dealt with by a simple wording change (maybe we "already say that", but the commenter doesn't think it's clear enough, or something), is that one that can also be dealt with directly (the editor directly responds "I propose to deal with that this way, is that OK?", and only if there's dispute does that get escalated), or should the editor request a commend id for those immediately?  </s>
