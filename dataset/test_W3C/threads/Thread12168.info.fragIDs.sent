<s> Well, there is a draft of sorts: It isn't finished, but the text is there.  </s>
<s> There are lots of broken links, or links going to the wrong place.  </s>
<s> There isn't yet a references document anywhere in the collection, nor a glossary.  </s>
<s> There are a bunch of errors in the text and document metadata - wrong editors assigned, wrong section numbers and so on.  </s>
<s> The links from the table of contents on the first page should work, but links to individual checkpoints might stil turn up broken anchors.  </s>
<s> So where do we go now: I will work on fixing the links because they are important.  </s>
<s> I will work on text mistakes as I find them, but will not go looking for them yet.  </s>
<s> I will add a references document and glossary.  </s>
<s> I will add the missing techniques for 4.1 and 4.2 and links to the appendix.  </s>
<s> I will write up the markup conventions that are important so editors know what not to mess around with.  </s>
<s> So please read it before the Monday meeting, and let's talk about how to move forward on it.  </s>
<s> (If you know the text of the previous draft there are few changes - this is mostly a structural re-write.  </s>
<s> If not, might as well go through the lot).  </s>

<s> Well, it is updated somewhat.  </s>
<s> I have now included glossary and references, and tried to make all the navigation linking work right.  </s>
<s> I have not yet incorporated the AERT stuff (I plan to do that before the meeting monday, or shortly afterwards) in guideline 4, and I suspect there are still odd errors around.  </s>
<s> I have not yet written up the markup conventions, but here are some clues: there is a standard template for each page, including linking information, navigation bars, and titles.  </s>
<s> The actual content is (theoretically - I think there is one missing still) in a single div.  </s>
<s> In some cases (such as glossary and references) this is to automate generation from other documents via some XSLT.  </s>
<s> Each checkpoint has a name/id which is consistent throughout and is consistent with ATAG 1 and with wombat (in case where a checkpoint has moved, the anchor name has not changed, so links to a technique for it will still go there).  </s>
<s> The document is (naturally enough) valid XHTML 1.0 written according to the compatibility with HTML guidelines.  </s>
<s> The sections are numbered - 0 is the cover page, 1-7 are implementation techniques for guidelines 1-7, 8 is evaluation techniques, 9 is glossary, 10 is references, and there is an appendix A on prompting.  </s>
<s> Note that I haven't updated the AUWG page yet, and it is 5 am so I am not going to do it now.  </s>
<s> Please use the URI above until the AUWG page points to the 1 August version of techniques.  </s>
<s> Cheers Charles  </s>
