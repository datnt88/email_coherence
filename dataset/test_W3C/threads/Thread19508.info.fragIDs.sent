<s> Hi! I just downloaded the solaris 2.5 binary of amaya, and started playing with it.  </s>
<s> Within a couple of minutes, it died with the message: *** Thot: Irrecoverable error *** I was typing into a table cell at the time. the same fatal error re-occurred after restarting amaya.  </s>
<s> Is this a known bug?  </s>
<s> Could it be due to my machine being a solaris 2.5.1 machine, rather than 2.5?  </s>
<s> If so, will compiling from source fix the problem?  </s>
<s> What little I've been able to see of amaya looks nice.  </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to get farther however.  </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how to prevent amaya from dying would be appreciated... thanks, Michael Bloom mike4bm@1stnetusa.com  </s>

<s> We're just preparing a new release by the end of April.  </s>
<s> So, could you send us the URL, the piece of HTML or a scenario to reproduce the bug?  </s>

<s> May we take this opportunity to request that the possibility of using "middle-button" instead of/as well as "double-click" should be included in this release, for the benefit of those of us who suffer from the "double-click" problem?  </s>
