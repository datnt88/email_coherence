<s> I was guilty of overstating the case for the WAI, since the Web clearly  </s>
<s> benefits some subset of people with a wide range of disabilities, including  </s>
<s> people with visual and motor disabilities today.  </s>
<s> Some of the potential users are ruled out because the browser is unsatisfactory for them, some because the source material is inaccessible, and many because they don't have access to the technology, either because of financial or logistical problems.  </s>
<s> I do think that the WAI is an important opportunity to influence the source material issues of the Web now.  </s>
<s> It seems that there is also some significant interest in browser issues.  </s>
<s> Changes made now actually have some chance to affect the quality of access and its reach.  </s>
<s> To suggest that work for the vision impaired is a prerequisite to, or directly portable to, work for other groups of disabled is inaccurate.  </s>
<s> Work for the vision impaired is not solely useful for the vision impaired.  </s>
<s> A huge group of people with learning disabilities, that far exceeds the population of the visually impaired, require these changes for effective access to the Web because they have difficulty reading.  </s>
<s> Although we have started in the blindness field, we have have increasingly been researching the needs of the LD population, which has a significant overlap with the needs of the blind.  </s>
<s> The ability to get better information about document structure and content is useful to the blind and might well be applicable to the needs of someone who needs the material in a less complex form, although they may be sighted.  </s>
<s> I've had good conversations with folks providing servers that take complex documents and break them down into less complex documents.  </s>
<s> I think this trend could be valuable to another large segment of people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Addressing the needs of the blind will be a prerequisite to and portable to some groups of people with disabilities, and not to others.  </s>
<s> This is a more accurate statement than my earlier message.  </s>

<s> For many of the problems associated with WWW access many of the problems can be solved and probably can only solved on the browser side.  </s>
<s> I guess we're boiling down to saying that Source and User-agent side are equally important.  </s>
<s> We plan to adress both in the WAI.  </s>
<s> My personal take on that is that Source is the *enabling* part while the user-agent work is the *delivering* part.  </s>
<s> Whatever that means :-)  </s>
<s> It's on our agenda for the Boston meeting (Tuesday August 5th) which is going to be focused on guidelines (all kind).  </s>

<s> Does the W3C have influence with major browser developers like Netscape or Microsoft over user interface design issues?  </s>
<s> We hope to think so!  </s>
<s> They are both members.  </s>
<s> As audiotapes go on the web, people who are deaf will have problems.  </s>
<s> I don't think you should assume that people interested in vision impairments are only interested in the source problems.  </s>
<s> [GV } absolutely.  </s>
<s> People with all disabilities have access issues at the browser / viewer end.  </s>
<s> Couple of additional thoughts.  </s>
<s> - Source documents used to only be a problem for people with sensory and cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> - Now that we are including user interface issues in source materials (e.g. Java applets et al) we are making source materials a problem for people with all disabilities.  </s>
<s> - Moreover, solutions in the browser (e.g. if we have an accessible browser) are not enough if the source materials (including the applets) are not accessible as well.  </s>
<s> - This is just more evidence for not treating them as separate entities in discussion accessibility.  </s>
