<s> Hello, I was curious about what MSIE 4.x does when bullets have been specified using images and style sheets.  </s>
<s> MSIE 4.x is the only browser that supports this at this time that I'm aware of - see which style sheet directives Netscape Communicator 4, MSIE 3.0 and 4.x support on mac and win95.  </s>
<s> i also tested amaya for win95 and double checked with NSC4 for win95 and found no support on either user agent.  </s>
<s> I created a test page ( style sheets to generate bullets for an unordered list and verifies against strict 4.0.  </s>
<s> I had the assumption that if images were not loaded an image icon would replace the bullet, or that a browser generated bullet would proceed an image icon without alt-text.  </s>
<s> Instead, I was happy to find that when images are not loaded it draws default bullets.  </s>
<s> Therefore, we never see two bullets nor do we see image icons without alt-text.  </s>
<s> The user agent guidelines ought to recommend similar "intelligence" so that it doesn't disappear from MSIE and is included in future user agents.  </s>

<s> It won't disappear from MSIE.  </s>

<s> hmm, it does sound like we're seeing different things.  </s>
<s> I've set up a mac with msie 4.0 (wow, is ie4 different between the two platforms!) You're right.  </s>
<s> With image loading off, all of the image bullets are loaded.  </s>
<s> The first 401K has a browser drawn bullet (as it should - it is not a list item of class "new").  </s>
<s> Also, the second 401K does NOT have a bullet at all because it is an item in a definition list (thought I'd try a few different things).  </s>
<s> Two questions I would like answers to: 1. why does this work differently between the mac and win95?  </s>
<s> 2. why is the IMG loaded?  </s>
<s> it is not associated with any list items?  </s>
<s> I think the answer might be that the image got loaded in the cache because of the style sheet property and therefore loaded wherever it appeared.  </s>
<s> I'm concerned that outspoken does not recognize the default bullets.  </s>
<s> It used to say something like "a acute" didn't it?  </s>
<s> wonder what's going on here.  </s>
<s> hmmmm.  </s>
<s> --wendy  </s>
<s> i'm using IE 4 on the mac with images turned off.  </s>
<s> with the exception of the FIRST line that reads "401K," all lines are preceded by three blue bullets of increasing size, left to right.  </s>
<s> (the SECOND "401K" line has no bullet at all.) this first "401K" line is preceded by a single default black bullet.  </s>
<s> none of the bullets, either blue or black, are recognized by outspoken.  </s>
<s> is this what you're seeing on your PC? it sounds like we're seeing different things.  </s>
<s> i was under the impression that IE 4/mac supports the same things as IE  </s>
<s> 4/PC.  </s>
