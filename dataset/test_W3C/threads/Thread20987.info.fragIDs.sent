<s> First, I love this program, use it every day, and hope to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.  </s>
<s> It simple meets my web page content development needs better than any other piece of software I've tried (and I've tried most of them).  </s>
<s> Yet, there are, of course, some problems that I keep noticing.  </s>
<s> Many are small matters.  </s>
<s> But...here are some of them:  </s>
<s> 1. I can move the text insertion point rapidly to the Left, skipping form the beginning of a word to the beginning of the word immediately previous, by using the [Ctrl] + [LeftArrow] keyboard shortcut.  </s>
<s> But if I try to go to the Right, using [Ctrl] + [RightArrow], the insertion point locks up and won't move.  </s>
<s> I can get it moving by using [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [RightArrow]--but that invokes a selection functionality, not mere cursor movement.  </s>
<s> This annoys me every time I use the program.  </s>
<s> The sort of insertion point behavior I'm expecting is simply a convention for text processing software.  </s>
<s> My text editor (jEdit) does this, as has all text editors I've ever used.  </s>
<s> All my email composition software does this.  </s>
<s> Dreamweaver does this.  </s>
<s> MS Word does this.  </s>
<s> Amaya does not.  </s>
<s> Why not?  </s>
<s> This is a BASIC functionality, and it doesn't seem to work well enough at this point.  </s>
<s> 2. If I want to call up program Help information, on most programs, I need only press the [F1] key.  </s>
<s> This, too, is a widely respected convention.  </s>
<s> But not in Amaya, which simply makes me work harder, as a user, and that's never a good thing.  </s>
<s> This is especially so when what I have to do is abandon keyboard control of the program and reach for the mouse - virtually never a quick solution to anything.  </s>
<s> Why is not this convention respected in Amaya?  </s>
<s> 3. There are many informational dialog windows, such as the program "Help  About" dialog, which accept no user input, but have a "Confirm" button in them which must be pressed to make the dialog vanish.  </s>
<s> Confirm WHAT?  </s>
<s> If there's no input, there's nothing to confirm.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the button would be correctly labeled if it said "Close".  </s>
<s> And this is not the only place this anomaly appears in the program.  </s>
<s> 4. In the above mentioned "Help  About" dialog window, when the program version is identified, IT IS IDENTIFIED INCORRECTLY.  </s>
<s> Ouch!  </s>
<s> I couldn't believe it.  </s>
<s> I happen to know that I'm running "Amaya 8.3 pre-release" version.  </s>
<s> The About window really ought to confirm that, don't you think?  </s>
<s> OK, now I'm really out of time.  </s>
<s> I do want to reaffirm that I do much like the improvements I see in this version.  </s>
<s> If just one of my complaints is attended to, I would wish it to be #1 above.  </s>
<s> That problem just makes NO sense.  </s>

<s> Hi, First of all, congratulations for this new release.  </s>
<s> I noticed that it still has a problem I already mentioned before about 8.2+.  </s>
<s> Irene answered it had been fixed in CVS but I did not check.  </s>
<s> It is easy to reproduce: - start a new empty document (e.g. XHTML 1.1, I did not try with other doctypes); - create a table with the default number of lines and columns; - set it's width to 100%; - set a style for the table "margin-right:20pt;margin-left:20pt".  </s>
<s> You will see that the bottom line of the border extends beyond the right limit of the table.  </s>
<s> It happens in display and when you print the document.  </s>
<s> This defect only shows on the right side, the left side is correctly displayed and printed.  </s>
<s> I use the amaya-GTK-8.3-.tgz binary version on a RedHat 8.0 box.  </s>
