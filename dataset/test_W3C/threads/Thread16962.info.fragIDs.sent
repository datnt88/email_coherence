<s> Hi  </s>
<s> I suspect they are, and while it might not be too much work making the CMS produce accessible HTML for the public doing the same for the editor interface and in addition having to comply with ATAG means that it's not a trivial task.  </s>
<s> I guess one acid test is -- can you edit the site using Lynx or do you need IE5.x or newer?  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> Hi, historically they have been very hard to come by.  </s>
<s> In the last couple of years I have noticed that many of these systems have been working on it quite hard, resulting in real improvement.  </s>
<s> On one hand systems such as mkdoc and ziteedit, being web-based, have become more accessible and will continue to improve as browsers do, as well as with improvements to their own interfaces.  </s>
<s> Similarly, many products have now been given a web-based interface, although the accessibility of those has sometimes left a lot to be desired.  </s>
<s> But there is more to the accessibility of a system than its interface - not just the ability to add a longdesc or sevral, but also making it easy and natural for content authors to ensure that documents being produced will have useful structure.  </s>
<s> Where necessary, of course, this requires appropriate help documentation.  </s>
<s> All these requirements are detailed in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidlelines - http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10 - a W3C recommendation since february 2000.  </s>

<s> Giving our CMS an accessible interface is pretty straightforward.  </s>
<s> At the moment it is possible to update content using Lynx, and the structure of the resulting document is controlled - one of our aims was to enable day to day content editing by people who have knowledge of HTML, which has the useful side effect of giving output documents a useful structure, assuming the templates are well structured.  </s>
<s> Every level two heading, for example, is in a h2 element, never a horrendous mix of font and strong elements.  </s>
<s> One thing that does concern me is the editing of the templates.  </s>
<s> At the moment, that is only done through a text editor, and as such it can't really be done by non-techies.  </s>
<s> Is that an accessibility issue?  </s>
<s> I'll see if I get a chance to set up an example site so I can show you what I am talking about.  </s>
<s> Andrew Andrew McFarland UNITE Solutions  </s>
<s> Just a little note - there is a working group dedicated to guidelines and techniques for making authoring tools, including content management systems that produce web content, accessible.  </s>
<s> They are a public group - document designed to provide this kind of information - further techniques.  </s>
<s> They also have a mailing list and the archives are publicly available - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au Anyway, to the question that was asked...  </s>
<s> I think it is an issue that it is more difficult to edit templates, in terms of how useful the tool is.  </s>
<s> More to the point, if there isn't help and support for doing this accessible it is clearly an authoring accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> One approach that can be taken is to allow users to add pieces to a page in a structured way, without needing to write code.  </s>
<s> One tool that I have played about with recently did this - I don't know how accessible the interface was, but the basic idea was that you could add sections to a page, pages to a site, or subsections to a section.  </s>
<s> Each of these could include some useful things like images or links.  </s>
<s> That model is not uncommon - the question is just how to represent the existing structure and provide the ability to add a new item at each node of the structure.  </s>
<s> One possibility is to use a heading structure and provide a link at each point that allows adding a new item.  </s>
<s> Now that software is readily available (JAWS implemented it recently, other systems have had it for a while, and others will I hope catch up soon) to allow people to navigate either via the structure or via the links, this should be reasonably straightforward.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that you make this use some graphics as well as text, although it probably doesn't have to be very complicated.  </s>
<s> A slightly more difficult issue is good interfaces for linking.  </s>
<s> In general I have found interfaces in tools unfriendly and hard to understand.  </s>
<s> The model that I like is whatI got used to in Amaya, where you select the link, and then navigate to the target and select that.  </s>
<s> This could be done using some server-side processing - transform everything coming through so that each potential target gets a link added to it which is "make this the target of the link I am creating" and the rest of the linking (etc) works normally - this should be robust enough to allow freely linking to content navigated, but does involve some transforming proxying of the content while the user navigates to the target.  </s>

<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> I'm fairly confident ours could be made accessible out of the box - it should be more or less A-compliance anyway.  </s>
<s> Well, in theory it should be easy.  </s>
<s> Content management systems are actually a great boon for accessibility because they force a greater separation of content from navigation/appearance/layout (templates).  </s>
<s> This is only a good thing, as it forces site operators to think in separation terms which are amenable to accessibility.  </s>
<s> In practice, many content management systems which could be made accessible still have a ways to go when it comes to the actual management part of it.  </s>
<s> Making the output accessible is easy enough; you just need decent templates and code, and you can produce WCAG and HTML/XHTML compliant output.  </s>
<s> The trickier part is making the administrative user interface accessible, and in that the CMS has to conform not only to WCAG guidelines but also to (IMO) the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines as it's an authoring tool.  </s>
<s> My own experience with CMS companies has been rather negative, as even after Reef acquired Edapta, they were still amazingly and unresaonably opposed to making the kinds of changes to their CMS that would allow it to be used by people with special needs to produce content.  </s>
<s> Massaging the system enough to make accessible output was easy enough -- once you figured out how to get around the fact that it didn't allow ALT attributes on IMG tags -- but the real problem was the admin side itself.  </s>
<s> I guess disabled people are only supposed to "view" the Web and not "publish" to the Web, from what I was told.  </s>

<s> The point is that if I have difficulties reading, I cna concentrate on reading the content, and not the markup.  </s>
<s> (This is not just people who are identified as cognitively impaired.  </s>
<s> It really genuinely does apply to me, and to many people I know, and the lack of WYSIWYG authoring tools that can easily be used to produce accessible content is a genuine and significant problem in making the web more accessible.  </s>
<s> One of the big problems with the tools that do exist is that very few are designed for working with structured content - they produce visualy formatted contetn which has a structure implied in the presentation.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, that structure is lost when someone uses a presentation that suits them.  </s>

<s> If you believe that accessiblity is simply making the information (content, structure) available for users, then the greater challenge is ensuring that the information is provided in such a way so that all users, including those with disabilities can easily understand and make use of the information.  </s>

<s> Andrew, You bring up a valit point to which I can only respond that in all things, there is usually at least a little training.  </s>
<s> I believe that in most of what best practices is designed to do is embodied the idea of an approach that minimizes the cost of ownership as you have described it here.  </s>
<s> This is of benefit to all end users of any product and is a good business strategy as well while achieving the broadest acceptance possible.  </s>
<s> If for example, I develop an audio only interface, How many people have I left in the dark not counting those with hearing difficulties?  </s>
<s> Not counting those with any defined disabling conditions?  </s>
<s> The answer is many.  </s>
<s> The reasons are legion.  </s>
<s> The ideas encompassed in universal design provide for accessibility in terms of use as well as availability so The equasion does not stop at making something available unless you take it at least to the point where it is accutely available or easily available or some such.  </s>
<s> This also applies to the output of a software product for instance, If the output is accessible/available but not usable by someone either because it is proprietary or is not manipulatible by available tools, available being person centric, that information is not accessible in the sense in which we form the answer to the question of what is accessible.  </s>
