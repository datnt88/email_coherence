<s> The ERB schedule calls for voting on Feb. 26 on these items.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that these can sanely only be discussed collectively.  </s>
<s> It is multi-part and multi-dimensional, but none of the parts seem really orthogonal to any of the others.  </s>
<s> If people wish to take up sub-questions in detail, this is welcome.  </s>
<s> I encourage creativity and discipline in the use of subject lines to enhance the usefulness of the discussion.  </s>
<s> Dimension 1: Which pieces of information should be specified for possible inclusion in linking elements?  </s>
<s> b. Type  </s>
<s> c. Role  </s>
<s> d. locator  </s>
<s> e. caption  </s>
<s> f. behavior  </s>
<s> g. locator scheme (e.g. URL, FPI, TEI locator)  </s>
<s> h. others [nominations encouraged]  </s>
<s> For each of the pieces of information to be included in linking elements, the following questions apply: (i) should it be optional or required?  </s>
<s> (ii) should it be associated with links or allowed to vary per locator?  </s>
<s> (iii)should it be carried in the GI, in an attribute name, or in an attribute name-value pair?  </s>
<s> (iv) should we predefine a set of values?  </s>
<s> (v) if so, should we provide a mechanism for "subclassing"?  </s>
<s> (vi) should we allow the use of values other than those predefined or subclasses thereof?  </s>
<s> All of those, i.e. NOT 'behaviour', and no others.  </s>
<s> All optional except locator.  </s>
<s> Type is per link element, locator and scheme per explicit resource (i.e. one in (simple) links, one per locator element in mlinks);  </s>
<s> caption and role per resource (i.e. two in links (see previous message  </s>
<s> about name collision) and one per locator element in mlinks).  </s>
<s> All in av-pairs.  </s>
<s> Type: no, just a syntax, as before: a(.a)* Role: ditto.  </s>
<s> Locator scheme: a minimum set, not closed.  </s>
<s> Locator: no, just a syntax per scheme, by reference to relevant standard Caption: CDATA  </s>
<s> Implicit in answers above.  </s>

<s> (Whatever happened to a in this list?)  </s>
<s> (i) Required - must be a member of a set of XML-defined types (ii) One per link (iii) attribute name/value pair, e.g. linktype=xlink (iv) Yes (v) Yes (vi) No  </s>
<s> (i) Optional (ii) One per locator (iii) attribute name/value pair, e.g. role=source (iv) No - but we could define a useful starter set (as per REV/REL in HTML) (v) N.A (vi) Yes  </s>

<s> (i) Optional (ii) One per link (iii) attribute name/value pai, e.g. behaviour=.... (iv) No - but we could define a (small) useful starter set (v) Yes (vi) Yes  </s>
<s> (i) Optional (ii) One per locator (iii) attribute name/value pai, e.g. scheme=.... (iv) No - but we should define a starter set as being TEI + whatever Internet offers (v) Yes (for MIME-types!) (vi) Not for 1.0, but we will need to later when DSSSL/SDQL becomes popular)  </s>

<s> Inclusions of other types should be considered for XML 2.0 contingent on the results of work in the URL working groups.  </s>
<s> Locator schemes outside the IETF definitions are not Internet locator schemes.  </s>
<s> Where a resource is identified by a scheme for which there is not a URL-based scheme (eg., FPI) it should not be considered a locator.  </s>
<s> It should be considered an identifier.  </s>
<s> The notion that an Identifer=Locator is not sound.  </s>
<s> Not now.  </s>
<s> Let the implementors work with the above.  </s>
<s> Then determine what else is viable.  </s>
