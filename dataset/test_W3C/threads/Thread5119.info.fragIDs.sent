<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The results are different.  </s>
<s> If this is due to some bugs in the SuperClass/SubClass processing on the "old" tap server, which no longer occur on the "new" panic server, you may just want to ignore the differences.  </s>
<s> Likewise, if the differences are due to "missing" type &amp; subClassOf links on the "old" tap server which have been added on the "new" panic server, you may want to ignore them.  </s>
<s> 2. The "Property" crash on the panic server appears to be a bug caused by trying to process a nonexistent "PropertyType" class.  </s>
<s> You may want to add some error recovery for this situation.  </s>
<s> I just reran this case to double check what's happening.  </s>
