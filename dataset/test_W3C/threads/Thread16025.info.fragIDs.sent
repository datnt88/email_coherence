<s> Tables add to the file size and can be aproblem with accessibility if nto used properly.  </s>
<s> In a rapid application environment, universal accessibility items can be missed when there are updates and tables compound the review process - if there is one.  </s>
<s> Basically, the less there, the easier it is to maintain. the most accessible accolade I give this site is tables were not used for layout, only data.  </s>
<s> So here is an example of a functional web site.  </s>
<s> The target audience was unions and coporation who needed access to information (and the public).  </s>
<s> We never received a bad comment and only received thanks for making a web site that downloads fast, and is functional and usable, where information is easy to find.  </s>
<s> In regrards the statment on the use of deprecated HTML elements, will let Jamie speak to this as I am no longer there.  </s>
<s> If they were a part of the original design, then I missed this in the quality assurance review.  </s>
<s> Then again, we were flying and also the Guildelines were draft back then and the revisions were a moving target smile .  </s>
<s> But deprecated has alway been a part of HTML 4. rob w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  </s>
<s> In the case of the example you provided, your page appears to be fully accessible, but it uses deprecated HTML elements to control the appearance of the page.  </s>
<s> Here, CSS would be required.  </s>
<s> Or, simply strip out the deprecated elements, and you're fine without CSS.  </s>
<s> Question: Is the page with CSS instead of the HTML more accessible, less accessible, or equally accessible?  </s>
<s> Can you explain exactly how the accessibility has been noticeably improved in this case?  </s>
<s> Note that there may be a choice between "having this look the same in Netscape 3.0 and Netscape 4.0" and "making a very minor increase in accessibility."  </s>
<s> For some agencies or companies, the tiny benefit is not worth the cost of losing support for Netscape 3.0.  </s>

<s> "Safe Styling" That is so cool!  </s>
<s> Can we put this in 3.3, "use CSS to control layout and presentation and practice safe styling" sorry folks, couldnt resist.  </s>
<s> its saturday and i am at work ugh Guidelines  </s>
<s> The guidelines state "use CSS to control layout and presentation".  </s>
<s> This  </s>
<s> means  </s>
<s> it is possible to create a page which does not use any particular presentation control (which is what I normally do) and to attach a  </s>
<s> stylesheet  </s>
<s> which provides safe styling if you want.  </s>
<s> Question: Does the HTML Writers Guild's homepage, at It uses both HTML _and_ CSS for layout and presentation.  </s>

<s> Adam, "3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]" sounds very definitive to me.  </s>
<s> It does not say, Style Sheets may be used to control layout and presentation."  </s>
<s> Lets substititue words, "Use both hands to control the saw" smile .  </s>
<s> I can cut with wood with a saw using one hand, but this wording does not give me an option to use one hand or HTML 4 done properly.  </s>
<s> Once more, I fear managers will read 3.3 literaly.  </s>
<s> I know I do.  </s>

<s> rob if i strip out the out the deprecated elements, I am fine without CSS, but then I did not use a style sheet.  </s>
<s> thanks, rob  </s>
<s> How does every one feel, if we were to make a separate checkpoint section for all CSS relaed items?  </s>
<s> We could even put check point 11.1 as the lead checkpoint for this CSS.  </s>
<s> That way, "Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when supported" is up front and if someone chooses not to use CSS then this whole section becomes "Not applicable".  </s>
<s> Thanks to Judy for pointing out Checkpoint 11.1 smile .  </s>
<s> my difficulty now is if i am rating a site's conformance or if some one is rating this for me, then we really have to dig and causes extra work.  </s>
<s> We need to streamline the review process as I am sure other people besides me would appreciate this!  </s>
<s> I think we can look at this from a usability focus.  </s>
<s> Basically CSS is all over and rightly so, but does it make sense to centralize this?  </s>
<s> rob  </s>
<s> My thanks to the authors of URL: Given the intricacies of the WCAG, I think one would be hard pressed to create a more streamlined tool!  </s>
