<s> At the DeltaV meeting in London, we discussed how to make a resource unversioned.  </s>
<s> We determined that the current method currently proposed in section 2.2.1 of draft 16 (COPY the latest version of the resource to a new location, then DELETE the old versioned resource, then MOVE to rename the new unversioned resource to the old name) is broken, for the following reasons: - It's not guaranteed to work, but not guaranteed to fail if it doesn't work.  </s>
<s> E.g. the server might automatically create a new versioned resource.  </s>
<s> No way for the client to tell in advance.  </s>
<s> - Log files, permissions, etc. are lost in this series of moves - Permissions could prevent the completion of this sequence of events and leave the documents in a poor intermediate state.  </s>
<s> With a single request, a permissions failure leaves the client in the same state as it was before it started.  </s>
<s> - basically, it's a side-effect, not a designed behaviour, and relies on several non-atomic operations working together We discussed replacing that with the recommendation "delete the VHR to remove a resource from version control".  </s>
<s> This has fewer problems because it's at least a single atomic request.  </s>
<s> However it also has weaknesses, some of which I didn't remember quickly enough to bring up in the meeting: - it could break situations where more than one VCR points to the same VHR, a scenario which has specifically been discussed as being permitted by DeltaV.  </s>
<s> Would it make all those VCRs no longer versioned?  </s>
<s> - it requires clients and particularly servers to support an entire optional chapter of DeltaV, and a new resource type with all its live properties, just to get the ability to remove a resource from version control.  </s>
<s> - the spec would have to deal with the order of delete operations.  </s>
<s> To delete a resource and all its versions, must the client delete the VHR first then the now-recently-unversioned resource?  </s>
<s> Is deleting the VCR when the VHR still exists forbidden?  </s>
<s> A specific syntax for making something unversioned is still the cleanest way to go, because when you design a specific syntax for a specific job you're more likely to be able to make it work.  </s>
<s> But in the absence of that, the draft should at least be brought up-to-date with the most current VHR-deleting recommendation.  </s>

<s> From: Lisa Dusseault [mailto:lisa@xythos.com] At the DeltaV meeting in London, we discussed how to make a resource unversioned.  </s>
<s> We determined that the current method currently proposed in section 2.2.1 of draft 16 (COPY the latest version of the resource to a new location, then DELETE the old versioned resource, then MOVE to rename the new unversioned resource to the old name) is broken The conclusion reached at the DeltaV meeting was not that this method was broken, but rather that although there would be some benefits to an explicit UNVERSION-CONTROL method (such as the ones Lisa identifies in her message), there was not sufficient support for this new method within the working group to add it to the protocol.  </s>
<s> The UNVERSION-CONTROL method is just one of many possibly useful features that did not receive sufficient support to be added at this point.  </s>
<s> When the DeltaV protocol goes from proposed standard to draft standard, there will be an opportunity to pick up new features that have proven to be needed, and drop features that have proven to not be needed.  </s>
<s> The recent consensus has been that the protocol is sufficiently complex that it is appropriate to defer any new feature that does not conflict with existing semantics (i.e. a new feature that can subsequently be added without conflicting with what is currently defined in the protocol).  </s>
<s> We discussed replacing that with the recommendation "delete the VHR to remove a resource from version control".  </s>
<s> However it also has weaknesses, some of which I didn't remember quickly enough to bring up in the meeting: - it could break situations where more than one VCR points to the same VHR, a scenario which has specifically been discussed as being permitted by DeltaV.  </s>
<s> Would it make all those VCRs no longer versioned?  </s>
<s> Yes, this problem was raised in followup discussions following the working group meeting.  </s>
<s> A server could reasonably refuse to allow the deletion of a version history in this case, remove all of those VCR's from version control, or leave them all dangling.  </s>
<s> Following those discussions, it was concluded that the "delete version history" was not an appropriate way to remove a resource from version control, and therefore the method that is described in the current protocol (COPY to temp, MOVE to original URL) is the best way to achieve this result in the current protocol.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Lisa, There did not seem to be sufficient support from the working group to warrant introducing an unversion method at this time.  </s>
<s> I can see you concerns though, and suggest this would be an appropriate topic to bring up again when we move DeltaV from Proposed to Draft standard after there has been more implement experience for both clients and servers.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, see the additional comments below where I've attempted to address some workarounds for your concerns based on the current protocol.  </s>

<s> E.g. the server might automatically create a new versioned resource.  </s>
<s> No way for the client to tell in advance.  </s>
<s> True, but it might not be as bad as it at first seams.  </s>
<s> If the copy fails, then the system state isn't changed.  </s>
<s> Note that using a copy explicitly allows the user to select which version is to be the unversioned resource, not just the latest version.  </s>
<s> If the delete of the history resource fails, then the copy is still there creating the new unversioned resource.  </s>
<s> The move to rename can still be done since any VCR that has the same name can be deleted even if the history resource wasn't deleted.  </s>
<s> If the server automatically creates a new versioned resource, then its a server that does not support unversioned resources, or has been configured as such.  </s>
<s> This sounds like the correct behavior.  </s>
<s> So the user gets what they wanted, and chances are if a delete of the history resource fails, so would an unversion which would have to at a minimum do the delete.  </s>
<s> - Log files, permissions, etc. are lost in this series of moves Don't know what log files you are referring to, but they would have to be server or application dependent anyway.  </s>
<s> Your server would have to handle its own extensions, and clients can easily deal with the permissions given the ACL spec.  </s>
<s> - Permissions could prevent the completion of this sequence of events and leave the documents in a poor intermediate state.  </s>
<s> With a single request, a permissions failure leaves the client in the same state as it was before it started.  </s>
<s> Same as the first issue with the same comments.  </s>
<s> - basically, it's a side-effect, not a designed behaviour, and relies on several non-atomic operations working together We discussed replacing that with the recommendation "delete the VHR to remove a resource from version control".  </s>
<s> This has fewer problems because it's at least a single atomic request.  </s>

<s> Would it make all those VCRs no longer versioned?  </s>
<s> - it requires clients and particularly servers to support an entire optional chapter of DeltaV, and a new resource type with all its live properties, just to get the ability to remove a resource from version control.  </s>
<s> In reality, clients already have to support history resources in order to support DeltaV semantics.  </s>
<s> The only thing that's optional is to provide a server generated URL for them, and expose their properties.  </s>
<s> This option was included because of one vendor who did not want to have to generate the URLs.  </s>
<s> However, all DeltaV servers have to support generated URLs at least for versions, have to be able to support live and protected DeltaV properties, and have to provide information on the history of versioned resources for the reports.  </s>
<s> So I don't think support for a history resource is adding much burden to a DeltaV server, and the notion of a history resource is so fundamental to versioning that I think it should be required.  </s>
<s> - the spec would have to deal with the order of delete operations.  </s>
<s> To delete a resource and all its versions, must the client delete the VHR first then the now-recently-unversioned resource?  </s>
<s> Is deleting the VCR when the VHR still exists forbidden?  </s>
<s> A specific syntax for making something unversioned is still the cleanest way to go, because when you design a specific syntax for a specific job you're more likely to be able to make it work.  </s>
<s> But in the absence of that, the draft should at least be brought up-to-date with the most current VHR-deleting recommendation.  </s>
<s> The delete semantics of history resources may not be something the protocol should define.  </s>
<s> Servers implementations may make it impossible to remove all working resources and/or VCRs.  </s>
<s> Some may not be able to handle dangling references in VCRs.  </s>
<s> Some may choose to disallow the operation altogether.  </s>
<s> This looks like something that will require some implementation experience.  </s>
<s> Since unversion would have to address the same issues, we probably should wait to get this implementation experience.  </s>
