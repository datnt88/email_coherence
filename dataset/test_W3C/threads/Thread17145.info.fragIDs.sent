<s> I want to validate my form so that the required fields each contain data, entered by the submitter.  </s>
<s> Accessibility demands that a text area field contain default text.  </s>
<s> When default text is included for a form field it validates automatically, and the submitter does not receive a reminder to fill in the required fields.  </s>
<s> How can I include default information in the text field AND validate that same text field?  </s>
<s> Thanks Donna  </s>
<s> Well, presumably all you would have to do is check that the text field isn't empty *and* doesn't contain the default text.  </s>
<s> Something like... if ((textfield == '') || (textfield == 'default text')) { echo "You need to fill out all the forms"; What are you using to validate the form anyway?  </s>
<s> Javascript?  </s>
<s> PHP?  </s>

<s> No, that's generally considered as not applicable any more.  </s>

<s> (at http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#tech-place-holders ) this is to read so that it is no more relevant, since user agents handle empty controls correctly.  </s>
<s> Simply don't include any "dummy" default text as a placeholder.  </s>
<s> But if there is a meaningful default value that helps the user, it should be included.  </s>
<s> In that case, it should be acceptable input and there should be no reason to check against it.  </s>
<s> (But in general, it is possible to check that a form field value is different from a its initial value, at least by explicitly comparing it against a fixed value.) Jukka "Yucca" Korpela, http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if it's an acceptable solution (maybe other members of this list might be able to enlighten me), but I have always added a single blank space as default text.  </s>
<s> AFAIK, the requirement for default text arises from the fact that certain user agents might not display form elements at all if they are missing a default value.  </s>
<s> value=" " does not usually cause any problems in terms of automatic validators, and - hopefully - with those user agents that exhibit the quirky behaviour mentioned above (btw...anybody know which exact browsers behave that way ?). as long as you strip the leading blank space from the form results after submission, you should be able to still check if a user left fields empty.  </s>

<s> I haven't seen people mention any currently used user agents that require nonempty default values for fields.  </s>
<s> And we _know_ that "placeholder" values cause confusion, since they can be confused with real default values, which are something that the user may actually select.  </s>
<s> Besides, it may take extra effort to remove the dummy text, disturbing user concentration.  </s>
<s> Actually, even if there were user agents that require nonempty defaults, it would be better not use them, since on the balance, such defaults cause more trouble than they can possibly help.  </s>
<s> People who use so dated browsers that they cannot handle empty fields really need to switch to better browsers, since empty fields abound on Web pages.  </s>
