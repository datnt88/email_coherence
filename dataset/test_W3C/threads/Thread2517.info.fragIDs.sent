<s> I think the best approach would be to establish an IANA registry for HTTP status codes, "preload" it with all of the status codes defined in the next draft of the HTTP/1.1 spec, and then insist that people defining new status codes use the IANA registry to avoid conflicts.  </s>
<s> If people are going to propose additional methods or headers, outside the context of the HTTP working group, then it might be a good idea to establish IANA registries for these namespaces, too.  </s>

<s> SIP and RTSP re-use a number of HTTP status codes, among other properties.  </s>
<s> It is likely that they may need to or want to adopt other HTTP status codes that emerge in the future.  </s>
<s> Thus, it is desirable that the SIP and RTSP-specific status codes do not conflict with HTTP codes.  </s>
<s> One possible solution: Declare officially that HTTP will only use status codes up to x49 (say) and leave others for private extensions, including SIP and RTSP.  </s>
<s> (Note to HTTP-WG: SIP and RTSP are described, inter alia, at and Comments and decisions are appreciated.  </s>

<s> There may be things other than SIP and RTSP, and it may be the case that  </s>
<s> those other protocols will define status codes which are useful in SIP and RTSP and HTTP, so it might be better to do something like this: x00 through x49 is for HTTP x50 through x59 is for SIP x60 through x69 is for RTSP and then we can assign blocks of ten to a few more protocols later.  </s>
<s> another possibilty is to state that x00 through x49 are for things defined by the HTTP spec authors, and x50 through x99 are for others, and have one central authority to control allocation of those numbers in the x50 through x99 range.  </s>
<s> (It is probably desireable to keep the status codes defined by HTTP consecutive.) But whatever we decide to do, I don't think SIP and RTSP should be considered `private extensions'.  </s>
<s> Perhaps `defined by people other than the authors of the HTTP spec' is an OK description, though.  </s>
<s> One way or the other, I believe there is going to need to be an IANA registry.  </s>
<s> Private codes don't work too well, as two different people might still happen to choose the same one.  </s>
<s> To get one, you need a standards track document that defines the process to deal with the registry.  </s>
<s> (I.e. IANA needs directions on how it should be run).  </s>
<s> So you need to generate an Internet draft outlining the process, and circulate it to the appropriate working groups.  </s>
<s> It doesn't have to be long, but it does have to exist, and go through the normal mill.  </s>
<s> I think you'll find people here receptive to such a document (but don't expect any volunteers from here either to write the first draft; we have our hands full getting 1.1 to draft standard right now).  </s>

<s> A brief inspection of the specs makes me think that what's described aren't what I'd think of as HTTP extensions, but rather protocols that bear the same kind of relation to HTTP that HTTP had to MIME: they are borrowing a lot of details but doing something different.  </s>
<s> (You might be able to make a server that talked both on one port, but it would be a bit of a hack.) Having multiple net-ascii-style protocols share a space of response codes could get sticky.  </s>
<s> Even if the numbers match, you might find that the interpretation differed.  </s>
<s> (Issues like caching are making the meaning of HTTP/1.1 responses a bit more complex.) Albert Lunde Albert-Lunde@nwu.edu  </s>

<s> I don't know if there are any deployed implementations of SIP and RTPS already.  </s>
<s> If there are not, I would suggest using 4 digits for all SIP and RTPS codes not inherited from HTTP, e.g. 1xxx for SIP and 2xxx for RTPS.  </s>
<s> HTTP-inherited codes could be 0xxx or simply xxx.  </s>
