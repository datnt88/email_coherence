<s> That is, if it were a user option or done on user request.  </s>
<s> Then the titles would only be fetched if the user was looking at blank image anchors and had no idea what they pointed to.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what David Poehlman said:  </s>
<s> It is a question of when you GET the page that the link leads to.  </s>
<s> The idea is that if there is an un-explained link in page A which leads to page B, then why not pre-fetch page B and extract its TITLE which would then be displayed as the link text in page A where there is a link to page B. Maybe the best thing to do with this technique is to experiment with it under the WAI-ERT umbrella.  </s>
<s> It may be that it is a reasonable source of ALT text suggestions for authors.  </s>
<s> Or it may turn out that authors who insert image links without ALT, link to authors who post pages without TITLE.  </s>
<s> There are options in HTTP where you can get just the top n bytes of a page, so we don't absolutely have to pre-fetch the whole page.  </s>
<s> But the text of the page is not the bandwidth problem, anyway.  </s>
<s> For Author prompting, if there is a META SUMMARY tag which has been inserted to make search engine hits format cleanly, that is golden and the SUMMARY should be used as a clue if the author of the referring page can't quickly come up with link text.  </s>
<s> But simply a tiled over/under display of the "from" and "to" points of the link (positioned viewframe selected from HTML document) is what may make the most sense as an aid in authoring.  </s>
<s> For authoring, what is critical is to communicate the link [ALT] text question to the author as an issue of continuity.  </s>
<s> Everybody has had their composition teacher tell them they need to scrub up their continuity at some time in their life.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>
