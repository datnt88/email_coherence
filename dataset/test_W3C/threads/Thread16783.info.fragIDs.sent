<s> Please forgive the cross-post... Does anyone know more on this case than Yahoo had?  </s>

<s> I wonder why her company deemed voice recognition software "not viable."  </s>
<s> VR software makes computer work possible for so many people afflicted with repetitive-stress injuries, including journalists and writers like Macworld's David Pogue.  </s>
<s> Denise, if you find more information on the case, would you mind posting the references here on w3c-wai-ig?  </s>

<s> Jo, Here's more information that Len Sandler was kind enough to send.  </s>
<s> Its a bit long, but is an interesting read &amp; brings up some good points.  </s>
<s> Len sd that the case is not as damaging as it first appears, but I definately still have questions.  </s>
<s> I would love to know what everyone thinks.  </s>
<s> I am attaching it as a Word doc as well as a .txt.  </s>
<s> I hope everyone is able to read it okie.  </s>

<s> Having read Yahoo!'s articlet and the original case report, I thought I'd add a UK perspective to this debate.  </s>
<s> Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (the relevant UK piece of legislation), disability is defined as where a person has a: 'physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities' (s.1(1)) This seems to roughly mirror the ADA.  </s>
<s> However, the DDA's definition is further qualified in Schedule 1 of the Act which sets out 'normal day-to-day activities' with a list of classes, one of which must be affected for a disability to be present.  </s>
<s> The second category of these is that of 'manual dexterity' which, as my dictionary tells me, is 'skill in using one's hands'.  </s>
<s> As such, I'd have thought it beyond doubt that the inability to use a keyboard as a result of RSI would be considered a disability.  </s>
<s> This is surely especially so given, as Judge Marsha Berzon said in her dissent, that the use of computers and being able to type are now *essential* skills in the modern workplace.  </s>
<s> The case makes reference to the plaintiff being able to carry out a wide range of tasks, such as cooking or shopping etc ant therefore the alleged disability was not 'substantial' as she could still do lots of things.  </s>
<s> However, had the case been in the UK, the Code of Practice, which accompanies the Act, defines substantial as being 'more than minor or trvial', rather than affecting a large number of manual tasks as suggested in the Appeal court's reading (perhaps 'quality' versus 'quantity').  </s>
<s> Following this, I would suggest that not being able to use a keyboard, and hence work, would be considered to be more than just a minor or trivial impairment and thus a disability.  </s>
<s> Further, there is nothing in the Code of Practice to suggest that a different view would be taken.  </s>
<s> I don't know how much guidance the ADA gives in defining a disability, however, it would seem that in this respect at least the DDA and its companion Code are more helpful.  </s>
