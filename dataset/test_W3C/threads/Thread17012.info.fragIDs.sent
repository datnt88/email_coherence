<s> Yep, agree to a point, but mixing percentages and pixles should be fine.  </s>
<s> I say this because when I was training to be a baker (a long time ago when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do) we used to create recipes in percentages as this gave the opportunity to work in grammes or pounds and ounces.  </s>
<s> Does it not work like that for pixels as well?  </s>
<s> I would agree that mixing elements such as pixles and ems could cause problems, but percentages should actually help.  </s>

<s> We set screen resolution in pixels.  </s>
<s> because pixels relate to the physical properties of our hardware.  </s>
<s> We also need to specify the number of pixels per inch.  </s>
<s> That way we can set the physical resolution to work well with the hardware, but set the logical resolution to something that works well with our eyes.  </s>
<s> Setting measurements in pixels ignores the second step.  </s>
<s> Sometimes you can olny specify in pixels though (when dealing with rasterized graphics, for example).  </s>
<s> The question "How does this site look at 800 by 600" is actually meaningless.  </s>
<s> You need to specify the pixels per inch as well.  </s>
