<s> As we work on the DOM Level 3 specification, the DOM WG is struggling with a couple of issues, which are probably related, on which we would appreciate any insignts:  </s>
<s> 1. How do we refer normatively to the IRI specification now, since we are producing documents which are progressing rapidly.  </s>
<s> 2. How do we generically refer to "Resource Identifiers" so that when the Next Great Thing after URIs and IRIs comes along, after URIs and IRIs, users of the specification can just use them instead of waiting for the DOM specification to be updated to permit it.  </s>
<s> I was going to just start calling them RIS's, Resource Identifier Strings, and then map that to present-day IRIs and URIs for the present, and anything in the future that may come along.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ray Whitmer DOM WG Chair  </s>
<s> Hello Ray, Many thanks for your interest in IRIs.  </s>
<s> I think this is a W3C-specific question, which this public list may not be able to address completely.  </s>
<s> Various W3C specifications have done various things to describe IRIs.  </s>
<s> The purpose of this list is to work on and finish the IRI specification quickly, not to tell people what to do in the meantime.  </s>
<s> It also may depend on what functionality exactly the DOM WG is planning to provide for IRIs.  </s>
<s> The DOM specs may use IRIs in different places, and these different places may need different solutions.  </s>
<s> For example, if the main functionality provided by the DOM is just to allow the user to set the value of an IRI, that may not need any particular reference to a specification (Imagine that the DOM defines a set/get interface for XML  </s>
<s> system identifiers.  </s>
<s> In that case, the DOM just has to make sure that the values for the set/get allow characters outside US-ASCII, and can leave the interpretation of these values to the XML spec.) So some more discussion may be needed.  </s>
<s> One of the principles of IRIs is that they should not be used indiscriminately where URIs are used, but that a spec actually should explicitly say that a given parameter/attribute/... is an IRI.  </s>
<s> This does not match well with the idea of 'automatic update'.  </s>
<s> Also, URIs in general are defined to be very flexible, and accommodate new functionality e.g. through new schemes.  </s>
<s> It is generally considered better not to impose strict syntax checks on interfaces that handle URIs to allow future evolution.  </s>
<s> Also, I don't know of any other major issue than internationalization that is outstanding.  </s>
<s> But if there were any, it wouldn't be on this list that it would be discussed.  </s>
<s> So maybe asking on the uri@w3.org  </s>
<s> list will give you a better idea.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your responses.  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I have not identified the correct list to ask about this.  </s>
<s> This list seemed the closest, although that may have been an erroneous determination.  </s>
<s> I18N lists do not seem correct, because these questions are not fundamentally internationalization questions -- the internationalization is already satisfied by IRIs and the question is how to replace URIs with IRI's or the next great thing.  </s>
<s> URI lists did not seem correct, because IRIs and other possible follow-ons are not URIs.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the tag list?  </s>
<s> DOM has never specified that these values were necessarily checked, but the user of a specification has been told that these are URIs.  </s>
<s> Just as a user who supplies a native filename argument would not expect a URI to work, even though it is possible to contemplate an implementation that allowed that, regularly supplying an IRI into an attribute or parameter which is called "URI" is quite problematic.  </s>
<s> As we fix this, it seems short-sighted to take an argument or attribute that was previously named or described as a URI and now call the argument an IRI.  </s>
<s> If we have to, I guess we make up our own generic name and description that will not break so easily again.  </s>
<s> But in practice, the idea of the automatic update (possibly with a few explicit exceptions) seems more likely.  </s>
<s> This is quite consistent with not only with my own own inclination, but also with the feedback from the I18N working group on the DOM Core and Load and Save Modules: C17) Substitute IRI for URI throughout.  </s>
<s> LS5) Substitute IRI for URI throughout.  </s>
<s> And we generally do exactly that where practical.  </s>
<s> But, again, IRI's are not URI's.  </s>
<s> The new URI schemes always followed the basic meta-rules, such as not permitting space and various other quite significant characters -- I am not worried about further evolution that is still a URI or IRI.  </s>
<s> That is already covered.  </s>
<s> I am worried about the next time new types are introduced.  </s>
<s> The thing to discuss on the URI list might be extending the URI specification so that IRI's can be properly called URI's.  </s>
<s> If this is not likely, it would not seem to me to be the proper forum.  </s>
<s> The URI rules are still quite restrictive in a number of ways.  </s>
<s> We suspect that there will be more out-of-the-URI-syntax-box enhancements.  </s>
<s> Is discussion of IRI's considered a subset of the URI discussion, or outside of the URI discussion because IRI's are not URI's?  </s>
<s> If it is outside, then it is not clear to me that that group discusses things that fall outside of their domain.  </s>
<s> We are not asking about how to refer to URI's, but rather how to avoid referring to any specific RI scheme such as URIs or IRIs because of the situation this leaves us in.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ray Whitmer  </s>
