<s> Right.  </s>
<s> I see now what you mean.  </s>
<s> Though it is not the case that any values of a union datatype do *not* have at least one lexical form, in the component (non-union) datatype, only that there is no L2V mapping to the value in the union datatype due to ordering of the union definition.  </s>
<s> The value *still* has a lexical representation.  </s>
<s> It's just "hidden" in the context of the union datatype.  </s>
<s> So the RDF requirement that all values have at least one lexical representation does not necessarily conflict with XML Schema.  </s>
<s> But if folks want to remove that requirement, I don't see it causing any real problems... Patrick  </s>
