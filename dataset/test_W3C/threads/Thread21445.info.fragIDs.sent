<s> (-cc: webont wg; +cc: public archive list) I'm reasonably happy with the current text, and don't see any urgent need for the WebOnt WG to consider the XML/10pts doc.  </s>
<s> (Perhaps some WebOnt WG members might like to contribute to the drafting of the RDF Primer, though?)  </s>
<s> Anyway, nitpicking (with an eye to the rdf primer as target doc): 'true knowledge' - is there any other kind (apart from non-propositional, which rdf/webont doesn't really attempt to capture...)  </s>
<s> 'collections of meanings' - I prefer to avoid physicalist metaphors for meaning.  </s>
<s> Talking about meaning as a type of thing or a type of stuff only confuses.  </s>
<s> You can't count it; and you can't weigh it either... But you can count (XML-encoded) claims about the proper/appropriate use of vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Meaning itself isn't downloadable, collectable... only (as per the final sentence) representable.  </s>
<s> Grumbles aside, this is useful text...  </s>

<s> Here is a stab at a replacement: XML provides syntax for W3C's RDF, a language for expressing metadata (information about information).  </s>
<s> RDF is the first step towards the Semantic Web, a web where not just uninterpreted data is passed between traditional applications, but instead one where self-describing information, and eventually true knowledge, can be transferred between autonomous agents---programs that reside in the web and that can cooperate with other such agents to achieve ad hoc tasks without preexisting agreements between them concerning the meaning of the data they exchange.  </s>
<s> To communicate such information, mechanisms for agreeing on the meanings of terms are needed, just as people need to have agreement on the meanings of the words they employ in their communication.  </s>
<s> Collections of meanings for terms in a certain area (from "shopping" to "manufacturing") are called ontologies and are a necessary part of the Semantic Web.  </s>
<s> RDF, ontologies, and the representation of meaning needed so that computers can bettter help people do work are all topics of W3C's Semantic Web Activity.  </s>
<s> I've tried to skirt fairly close to my hype limit, as this is, after all, sort of a press release.  </s>
<s> I'm certainly not totally happy with this paragraph.  </s>
<s> It is rather hype-y for my taste, and may have too little about XML in it for an ``XML in 10 Points'' document.  </s>
<s> The introduction of ontologies also does not flow as well as I would like.  </s>

<s> Sure. Except ....  </s>
<s> I don't have time, I don't have support from my management for doing it, and I hate writing primer-like materials.  </s>
<s> I was using true as in real, as opposed to fake.  </s>
<s> I admit that I also used it partly because of how it made the phrase sound, and also partly because of the other meaning of true (i.e., not false).  </s>
<s> As a formalist (or at least a quasi-formalist) I try to use neutral terms (like ``collection'') when I don't want to invoke any of the aspects of more-specialized terms.  </s>
<s> It might be better here to use a bare plural (``meanings'') or even a bare singular (``meaning'').  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what the next step should be.  </s>

<s> (Maybe we can pinch bits of this text for the Primer anyway...? eric?)  </s>
<s> heh :) I expect RDF/WebOnt to be used extensively for lies and half-truths, as per most email/internet/web precedents.  </s>
<s> When I get my first RDF/WOL spam message, I'll know we've gotten somewhere!  </s>
<s> (and yes -- picking up on another thread -- RDF reification isn't the best way to represent and reason about that kind of content...).  </s>
<s> As a scruffy ex-philosopher type, I suppose my tendency is to avoid nouns where their use might spawn "angels on pinheads" discussion (eg.  </s>
<s> "what is a 'Meaning'?"  </s>
<s> etc.).  </s>
<s> So I'd tweak your text slightly, eg as follows:  </s>
<s> Collections of meanings for terms in a certain area (from "shopping" to "manufacturing") are called ontologies and are a necessary part of the Semantic Web.  </s>
<s> Descriptions of the meaning of terms in a certain area (from "shopping" to "manufacturing") are called ontologies and are an important component of the Semantic Web.  </s>
<s> (this does slight violence to the way folk in this field use 'ontology', but I can live with that) I'm also inclined to seek words that gloss 'meaning' in terms of constraints on (sensible) usage.  </s>
<s> For eg: While it is difficult (*undestatement*!) to represent the full meaning of such terms in a machine-processable way, we can help machines make use of Web ontologies through giving them simple rules for the proper use and combination of these terms.  </s>
<s> To understand natural language terms is in large part to understand the constraints on their sensible usage; much the same is also true of Web ontologies.  </s>
<s> [eg here] Having written that, I'm not entirely convinced by it.  </s>
<s> Needs an example at least.  </s>
<s> Using words like 'constraint' can cause confusion eg with XML notions of validation; the RDFS spec currently suffers from that (though next draft won't).  </s>
<s> Me neither.  </s>
<s> Eric? where are things up to with the Primer?  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> Eric Ian and I revised the text substantially, resulting in: $Date: 2001/12/07 18:27:15 $ I phoned PatH to see if there were any critical problems remaning; he didn't see any.  </s>
<s> I don't see Peter's phone number handy.  </s>
