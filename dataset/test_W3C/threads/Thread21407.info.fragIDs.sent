<s> This doesn't use Annotea, but instead extends the approach to annotating images used by RDFPic.  </s>
<s> An offering from Norm Walsh that provides tools for adding information to jpeg images.  </s>

<s> That would be I take it?  </s>
<s> According to the blurb here (if I understand correctly), it doesn't allow you to modify the info actually within the jpeg, but allows you to extract and manipulate it.  </s>
<s> It uses RDF (via the Jena Java toolkit) so I imagine it's fairly Annotea-friendly.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>
<s> Ah yes, sorry for forgetting to put the URI, and thanks Danny for being on the ball :) You can query things in a jpeg (for example EXIF or I think XMP), and you can update them, according to the documentation that Norm provides: you can change what is in the jpeg already.  </s>
<s> One of the things that interests me is linking between annotea servers and how to federate diferent sources of information (for example merging info included in a jpeg and info about it stored in an annotea server).  </s>
