<s> This subject came up today on ciwah.  </s>
<s> Since I agree with the original questioner and have myself been through his frustration in the past, I'll raise it here.  </s>
<s> Validator, in common with various external projects, attempts to maintain an up-to-date library of DTDs, modules and schemas @w3.  </s>
<s> Of course, given the multitude of WGs producing them and the fact that some of them take no notice of validator, this can be challenging.  </s>
<s> It is doubly so from outside W3C, as you effectively have to spider the modules[1].  </s>
<s> If we were to run a CVS server for [sg|x]ml-lib on qa-dev, I wonder  </s>
<s> if it would be possible for someone to crack a whip amongst the WGs to ask them to contribute their work - at least when anything goes public - so we can maintain a decent repository without having to jump through hoops ourselves.  </s>
<s> [1] Hmmm - I wonder if I should hack up a DTD spider for exactly that purpose?  </s>

<s> I like the idea a lot (and we happened to discuss this with Terje a few days ago).  </s>
<s> Tarballs and clearly labeled "releases" would make this even better.  </s>
<s> And everything, of course, properly catalogued (SGML catalogs, OASIS XML catalogs).  </s>
<s> Yes, please, \/ille Skytt?  </s>

<s> Nick, I think this is a good question, and I believe this is an important problem that I (or Dom), as "staff contact" for the qa dev projects, should handle.  </s>
<s> I Need, however, to know more about the situation before going forward.  </s>
<s> I believe we run a CVS server for sgml-lib, at least, on dev.w3.org Are we talking about the same thing, and are you suggesting we move this to qa-dev?  </s>
<s> If "yes", then I think it should remain on dev, see below.  </s>
<s> If we want the WGs to contribute (which I think is a good idea, BTW), then we should use dev, where all the staff contacts for WGs have write access.  </s>
<s> Staff contacts and chairs should probably be our primary target if we are to ask WG to cooperate (more) closely with us about DTD and schemas releases.  </s>
