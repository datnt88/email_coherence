<s> --Kynn Text of the motion follows:  </s>
<s> HWG Governing Board member Kynn has submitted the following motion for consideration by the Governing Board: Moved: All web sites operated or co-operated by the HTML Writers Guild must meet standards of accessibility to disabled and other users.  </s>
<s> This standard of accessibility shall at least equal minimal (Single-A) compliance with the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines; further accessibility considerations for specific types of content may be added to this standard by executive decision of the President or a designated subcommittee on web accessibility.  </s>
<s> Allowances clause: Specific allowances or exceptions MAY be made on a case-by-case basis, by a full vote of the Board.  </s>
<s> Grandfather clause: The Guild will contact existing partners who may not measure up to our accessibility standards, and offer to work with them on increasing the accessibility of their web sites.  </s>
<s> The Board may have the option of granting allowances on these cases if deemed appropriate.  </s>
<s> Level Single-A Compliance: The single-A level of compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is defined as meeting all the applicable Priority 1 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Those consist of: [Checkpoints snipped] References: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG Checkpoints Reasons: The HTML Writers Guild is one of the leading proponents of "correctly done" HTML authoring -- which includes not only validation but accessibility.  </s>
<s> Therefore, our own sites _must_ be made accessible to Guild members with disabilities; to do otherwise is to adopt a "do as I say, not as I do" attitude.  </s>
<s> This resolution would also apply to partners who seek to co-brand a site with us; accessibility is required for all pages identified as "official Guild projects", and therefore all partners would be asked to meet the same standard of accessibility that we ask of ourselves.  </s>
<s> This will allow Guild members with disabilities to have access to any and all services provided by the HTML Writers Guild to our members.  </s>

<s> Kynn,  </s>
<s> congratulations to you and the board.  </s>
<s> On the one hand this seems like a logical step by the HWG given its involvement in W3C working groups (WAI and non-WAI groups), but making a public announcement of it is bound to help the wider community understanding of accessiblity as a basic technical issue.  </s>

<s> Charles, that's my thinking exactly.  </s>
<s> The Guild has a membership of more than 107,000 web designers world-wide (and if you're not a member, join now!  </s>
<s> -- trial membership is free), and as such we are one of the largest organizations that is _actively addressing_ web accessibility.  </s>
<s> In short, we want to make it known without a shadow of a doubt that we consider this to be important, by putting our money where our mouths are (and this may cost us some partnerships!) and making a strong statement about the importance.  </s>
<s> We've always (as an organization and on the Board) supported accessibility; this just makes it "official" and public, and hopefully can serve as a model for _other_ organizations and businesses to get them looking at their own accessibility policies.  </s>
<s> I believe in throwing the Guild's weight around for a good cause.  </s>
