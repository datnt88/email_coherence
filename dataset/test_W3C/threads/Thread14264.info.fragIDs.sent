<s> And a not entirely theoretical question.. Can a site claim AA conformance without using CSS?  </s>
<s> Another question is "if you use tables at all for layout" (such as http://www.hwg.org/ or http://www.kynn.com/)  </s>
<s> "can you ever get a Double-AA rating?"  </s>
<s> 3.6 says to use CSS for layout.  </s>
<s> 5.3 says to use tables for layout only when they make sense when linearized.  </s>
<s> Both are priority 2. Proper use of tables according to 5.3 means you aren't following 3.6, right?  </s>
<s> I continue to have worries that the vague wording of 3.6 and the requirement that CSS _must_ be used for formatting and layout (instead of alternatives that web authors are familiar with, such as tables) means that for nearly any commercial site out there, at best a Single-A rating is possible if they feel there is a commercial disadvantage to using CSS.  </s>
<s> Why's this matter?  </s>
<s> Why not just say "okay, so they'll be Single-A"?  </s>
<s> Because the granularity of the compliance rating system means that if you don't get one, you don't have an incentive to try for the others.  </s>
<s> In other words, if you simply _can't_ comply with this one priority 2 checkpoint ("use CSS for layout"), then why bother complying with the others?  </s>
<s> You will still be only a "Single-A" compliance site no matter what else you do... Kynn Bartlett mailto:kynn@hwg.org  </s>

<s> WL: I guess that for everything except U.S. Federally funded sites this makes a lot of sense.  </s>
<s> "Conformance" in the sense of Section 508 and whether purchase of only accessible goods and services is permissible probably must have some criterion.  </s>
<s> *RECOMMENDED* guidelines should be just that recommended.  </s>
<s> Priority and Conformance seem to be related to *REQUIRED* more than *recommended*.  </s>
<s> The notion that W3C can require anything is only germane when their recommendations have been given official primateur as in Access Board Regulations - beyond our purview.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I see a conflict in Checkpoint 5.3 and 5.4.  </s>
<s> Would not it be easier to say, "Tables can be used for data and layout.  </s>
<s> For data, here is what you need for a Priority 1 and then list checkpoints that must be done to btain AAA level.  </s>
<s> For layout, tables must use do not use structural mark-up and you can only obtain AA conformance level.  </s>
<s> When I am giving demonstrations to lay people and developers who are trying to get up to speed on Priorities and Conformance level, I get the biggest blank faces on Priority and Conformance level.  </s>
<s> I see two definitions as an impediment to the WCAG's adpotion and understanding.  </s>
<s> I liken Priorities and Conformance level to the extra click.  </s>
<s> So how can we have better usability and adoption of the the WCAG?  </s>
<s> Simple, by eliminating one click - Prioritites!  </s>
<s> I can see managers out there trying to get involved and confusing the issue.  </s>
<s> I already see confusion brewing in the trenches.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I propose we make this as simple as we can!  </s>
<s> good day, rob P.S. W3C server is not responding  </s>
<s> okay, i need to be careful when i say "required" but still think we are confusing people outside the communtiy who must implement this and come up to speed smile  </s>
<s> The definitions of priority and conformance lelvels are inextricably connected.  </s>
<s> One way of eliminating priorities would be to specify, in the conformance statement, exactly which checkpoints had to be satisfied at each level of conformance.  </s>
<s> There are several reasons why such a solution would be a retrograde move and why it should not be supported.  </s>
<s> First, by eliminating the priorities from the document, one would thereby remove a very convenient and practical indication, associated with each checkpoint, of the level of conformance to which it pertains (priority 1 checkpoints relate to level A only, priority 1 and 2 checkpoints relate to levels A and double-A; priority 3 checkpoints relate to all three conformance levels).  </s>
<s> Thus, if you want to satisfy the guidelines at a double-a level, you can simply work through the list, ignoring priority 3 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> This makes it very easy to connect the intended level of conformance to the task at hand, its being recognised that level A compliance is an important short-term goal, whereas tripple-A compliance could be regarded as a medium-term objective from the standpoint of an organisation or web site maintainer.  </s>
<s> If the priorities were removed, then in order to implement a specific priority level one would need a list of which checkpoints pertained to which level of conformance; and a user of the document would have to cross-reference each checkpoint against the relevant list.  </s>
<s> For me at least, and I suspect for many others as well, this would be impractical, and would probably act as a disinsentive that would discourage adoption of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> A second shortcoming of such a proposal is that the conformance statement would then become very lengthy and complex, as it would have to specify all of the individual checkpoints that related to each conformance level.  </s>
<s> A system in which, instead of a priority, each checkpoint was labeled with the names of the conformance levels to which it pertained (E.G. a priority 2 checkpoint would carry the designation, "A and double-A") is also problematic due to the existence of so-called "split priorities" in the document, which it has not been possible to eliminate.  </s>
<s> Their existence is a reflection of the observation that the importance of satisfying particular requirements can vary depending on the nature of the document as a whole.  </s>
<s> For example, language identification is more important in multilingual texts than in unilingual documents, owing to the difficulty of identifying language switches automatically based on textual analysis; whereas in the case of a monolingual text the language can more easily be identified, or at least it would be more reasonable to expect the reader to identify the language and set a software option.  </s>
<s> Other examples of split priority in the guidelines result from the differing importance that certain information can have in the context of a variety of documents.  </s>
<s> I would also dispute the assertion that the existing scheme of priorities is complex or difficult to understand.  </s>
<s> If it is well explained (and the definitions are clear and accurate), then it should not create any substantial obstacle to the application of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Education in the use of the WCAG is undoubtedly needed; especially at a priority 2 level and above, it fundamentally challenges the approach to web site development to which many authors have grown accustomed.  </s>
<s> This educative role is being most capably exercised by the Education and Outreach Working Group, as I understand the present circumstances.  </s>
<s> The basic point of the present contribution, however, is to argue that the existing priority and conformance definitions are better than the simpler alternatives which I have considered.  </s>
<s> The only prospect of simplifying the system appears to reside in the possibility of attempting to eliminate split priorities; but these were arrived at after much thought and discussion, and I doubt that they could be readily removed without undermining the integrity of the document, though this issue clearly deserves further consideration when and if the guidelines are redesigned.  </s>
<s> AG:: I would characterise this as "an Education and Outreach _opportunity_."  </s>
<s> Having both a 1 2 3 notation for checkpoint priorities and an A AA AAA scheme of ratings for satisfied-checkpoint sets is confusing the first time it is encountered.  </s>
<s> In a tutorial context, on can define P2 first as "a checkpoint you need to pass to get your second 'A'.  </s>
<s> It is required for AA conformance but not for A conformance level.  </s>
<s> [The '2' in 'P2' goes with your _second_ A; hint, hint!]"  </s>
<s> That is enough answer for those who want you to "just tell me _what_ I have to do."  </s>
<s> And for many of the people you brief that is the first question that they want answered.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I firmly believe what the GL working group said by refusing to define the priorities that way.  </s>
<s> It is important to have the "why" for these checkpoints clearly laid out as well as the "what."  </s>
<s> And the "why" for being included in this group is related to the severity of impact when the checkpoint is not met.  </s>
<s> Priorities can be explained in terms of a) their conformance rating consequences and b) their usability consequences.  </s>
<s> For tutorial purposes, it is good to have both of these explanations handy.  </s>
<s> This can be handled in the teacher's guide materials from EO, it would seem to me, and not require changes to the Guidelines document itself at least until there are other reasons requiring a version update.  </s>
<s> First may we divide the audience for Conformance/Priority 'twixt those who must and those who would "conform" with our Guidelines.  </s>
<s> The very word "guideline" seems divorced from compulsion and perhaps even from conformance.  </s>
<s> An intelligent author really will not be convinced that putting a language indicator within a document containing only one language will matter much for accessibility, the same for many other features: she will decide priorities on her own.  </s>
<s> In the case of Regulated situations there must be some pass/fail, reasonably objective checkpoints and this is the real reason for priorities and conformance levels: so that the U.S. Federal Hearing Officer can decide if Section 508 (which will likely ultimately refer to WCAG) is satisfied by the purchase of WidgetMaster 1.3 or a Web designer has indeed made the information accessible to PWDs.  </s>
<s> Although I voted against more than one priority (include/exclude a guideline/checkpoint) because I felt that if it wasn't important it shouldn't be there, I know that the reason my POV didn't prevail is because it was felt there were significant differences between inaccessible, difficult to access, and easier to access (must, should, nice).  </s>
<s> Given that we have only one document, there seems to be little point in worrying that people might ask "what *must* I do?" instead of "how can I help?" - we just have to explain, perhaps endlessly.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> The task of this working group is to write clear, accurate and comprehensive guidelines; that of the Education and Outreach working group includes introducing these concepts to a non-technical audience.  </s>
<s> The two requirements should not be conflated.  </s>
<s> Of course, if there are significant ambiguities in the guidelines and/or techniques document, they ought to be remedied in the next version, but as Al has argued, the priority system serves two purposes: it defines the conformance levels and provides a gradation of requirements depending on their impact upon people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> No one has yet proposed a simpler system that would satisfy  </s>
<s> these requirements.  </s>
<s> I think the question should be: is there any aspect of  </s>
<s> the existing definitions which would not be clear to an attentive and intelligent reader?  </s>
<s> It should also be added that there are several important constraints under which the guidelines operate: 1.  </s>
<s> They are expected to be implemented by tool developers (E.G. the Bobby evaluation software and tools being developed by the ER working group).  </s>
<s> 2. They may be referred to, directly or indirectly, in governmental policies and legal proceedings.  </s>
<s> 3. They can not be substantially changed without undergoing the W3C approval process.  </s>
<s> Several consequences follow from the above considerations.  </s>
<s> Firstly, the guidelines must be technically precise if they are to be implemented and used as the basis of regulation and policy.  </s>
<s> Second, they need to be as general as possible, so that they will not be rendered inadequate by every change in technology or in applicable technical standards.  </s>
<s> This is why the details of the requirements, and how to apply them, are left to the techniques document, and why the Education and Outreach working group has undertaken to document access requirements suitably for non-technical audiences.  </s>
<s> The guidelines are meant to be an authoritative reference, not a tutorial.  </s>
<s> It is to be expected that most people will concentrate on the techniques document or relevant educational materials, and refer to the guidelines only when it is time to check for conformance, by which stage they should be sufficiently familiar with the issues at stake to understand the terms in which the requirements are exprssed.  </s>
<s> Once an individual has reached this level of knowledge, the checklist offers a convenient point of reference which can be used in day-to-day web content development activities.  </s>
<s> Employing Robert's terminology, it can be said that the guidelines are analogous to a standard or specification; the techniques document provides explanation and concrete implementation advice; and they both need to be supplemented by tutorials, quick reference lists, and so forth.  </s>
<s> The guidelines presuppose familiarity with web-related standards and technologies.  </s>
<s> I am on the Education and Outreach Working Group and these are my beliefs and not a comment from the EO.  </s>
<s> We need to remember our audience that we must reach is both technical and non-technical.  </s>
<s> Actually i argue they are more non-technical.  </s>
<s> This group has become conditioned to instant gratification - unlike members here that understand the issues and can disect the points verbatim.  </s>
<s> People want to learn and are already taxed in a fast paced environment with zero overhead.  </s>
<s> They are pushed to be more productive so margins can be met at corporate.  </s>
<s> We are throwing so much at people.  </s>
<s> I give presentations and eduacate people/groups constantly in the DC Metro area and other spots across the USA.  </s>
<s> So I see the looks on people's faces contantly.  </s>
<s> Here is a simplistic scenario for a developer.  </s>
<s> 1. Comprehend what universal accessibility is.  </s>
<s> 2. Understand what their audience is up against so they "get it" 3. Sell this to their boss so they "get it".  </s>
<s> 4. Obtain approval to work on the redesign.  </s>
<s> If they are turned down due to timing or poor presentation, hopefully they continue with the next steps.  </s>
<s> 5. Read all literature - including WCAG and train.  </s>
<s> 6. Test concepts so they get up to speed and train 7. Implement without someone there who has any experience doing this.  </s>
<s> 8. Tell their manager they are compliant.  </s>
<s> 9. Train everyone else.  </s>
<s> We all are working on many processes to help UA along.  </s>
<s> Formal training and certification is one area and guidelines is another.  </s>
<s> I believe we need another set of Guidlelines or on the next revision that are written so they can be easily understood and implemented.  </s>
<s> Tonight I gave a presentation at the House of Representatives (Staffers &amp; System Adminstrators) Networkers Association meeting.  </s>
<s> I was one speaker among many talking about univerasal acessibility.  </s>
<s> Like many people they are trying to grasp what this is and what is involved.  </s>
<s> They must be able to sell this to their managers as well as the training, and processes to help this along.  </s>
<s> They need time to redesign the site while they are justifing this These are the types of people we need to target for universal accessibility to be a success!  </s>
<s> We need everyone to help make the WCAG easily digestable, especially the priority and conformance level.  </s>
<s> (One thought process would be better - keeping the conformanace level since it has received so much publicity).  </s>
<s> Implementing universal accessibility is a passion I share with many here.  </s>
<s> To me the WAI's job is full life cycle development that involves all facets - the groups.  </s>
<s> Just so happens, i beleive, the WCAG are now at the forefront and they need to be easily implemented so all efforts will be successful.  </s>
<s> rob  </s>
<s> definitions which would not be clear to an attentive and intelligent reader?  </s>
<s> rob sorry, but i think "attentive and intelligent reader" is a small subset of the overall audience, which includes artist, writers, editors, database designers and administrators, programers, coders, system administrators, line managers, supervisors, and senior managers (all of whom may or may not have a web background).  </s>
<s> but to answer, your question, yes.  </s>
<s> have we identified the target audience?  </s>
<s> maybe it is time to consider, "guidelines for dummies"?  </s>
<s> If we build it, they will come and embrace it.  </s>
<s> rob  </s>
<s> I think here is where i have the problem.  </s>
<s> Jason said, "The guidelines are meant to be an authoritative reference" As someone who has dealt considerably with requirements for engineering like ANSI, IEEE, Military standards, Safety of Flight, etc., I do not see the term "guidelines" as meant to be an authoritative reference.  </s>
<s> In the enginnering world, the more proper term would be "specification".  </s>
<s> A guideline would be less formal, more of a "how to" or a suggestions and would be referenced from a more formal document or specification.  </s>
<s> This is semantics but subject to interpretation by a wide and vaired audience.  </s>
<s> This is a very important point becasue i am not familiar with the W3C publish standards.  </s>
<s> Hmmm, couldnt Guideline be replced with standard?  </s>
<s> If the guidelines are to be amended and re-approved, then that is a given.  </s>
<s> A federal entity is expected to endorse the AA conformance level, i think that is enough incentive to make sure the guidelines' issues are flushed out and resolved.  </s>
<s> The alternative would be poorly implemented or possible useless web sites.  </s>
<s> Then if they were amended later, there will be much rework, increased costs and very angry web developers who are caught in the middle.  </s>
<s> You may not know, but I am one of these Federal web developers and it is an uphill battle.  </s>
<s> I have shown this to developers and managers and they stare and wonder what this thing is.  </s>
<s> We need to make guidelines that can be easily sold!. Adding an executive summary would be extremely helpful.  </s>
<s> We need something that is easily digestable.  </s>
<s> I have an issue with perceptions on "what is expected".  </s>
<s> If the checklist is to be a "convenient point of reference which can be used in day-to-day web content development activities," then this may be where the effort to direct people and the "Checklist for Dummies" approach can be used.  </s>
<s> Plus, Chuck and Geoff's tutorial will help and a training video would be solid too.  </s>
<s> As for the Education and Outreach efforts, this is predicated upon a solid base (my opinion).  </s>
<s> rob  </s>
<s> i think manager and developers that i encounter would brush off a document with the word guideline.  </s>
<s> This term is associated with a company or federal agenct or office's guideline.  </s>
<s> That is, everyone modifies a document to build guidleines.  </s>
<s> However, everyone understands the seriousness of standards and specifications.  </s>
<s> Jason, appreciate the good discussion.  </s>
<s> Would it make sense at this time to conduct an survey to WAI-IG or others to solicit their opinion on the guidelines and how they are being received?  </s>
<s> /rob  </s>
<s> JW:: "...it defines the conformance levels and provides a gradation of requirements depending on their impact upon people with disabilities."  </s>

<s> The same attitude as Jason expresses in "is there any aspect of the existing definitions which would not be clear to an attentive and intelligent reader?" should also apply to the authors' efforts to provide accessibility reasonably, not as to whether they achieve a particular grade.  </s>
