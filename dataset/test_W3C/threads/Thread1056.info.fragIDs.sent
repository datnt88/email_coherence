<s> Tidy should have a way of specifying if one wants all numeric entities converted to hex vs. decimal.  </s>
<s> E.g. Bob wants all mine hex, Bill wants all decimal.  </s>
<s> Why do you want hexadecimal character references?  </s>
<s> Browser support is worse than for decimal character references.  </s>
<s> Hex char references may  </s>
<s> save some bytes but if you care about that, you should probably use a character encoding that does not require to use character references at all.  </s>
<s> Hex char references may be easier to read for some people but then there is still the browser support issue.  </s>
<s> It's easy to implement, but I fear we would just be adding even more complexity to Tidy's configuration options without real value for Tidy users.  </s>
<s> Hex references have worked in IE since at least 5.0 and in current Mozilla and Opera builds for as long as I can remember.  </s>
<s> The only browser still in use that does not support them is Netscape 4.x, and that browser is slowly disappearing (thankfully!:).  </s>
<s> The main reason, IMO, for allowing hex references is entering from and checking against the Unicode tables.  </s>
<s> I agree with Dan -- I think having an option for expressing character references in hex is a good idea; something like: hex-references: yes/NO /Jelks  </s>
