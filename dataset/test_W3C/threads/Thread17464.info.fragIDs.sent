<s> I am pre-announcing it because we think that you can use it, but it is a beta and we know there are some things we haven't done yet.  </s>
<s> Try it at Among them is translating the entire documentation.  </s>
<s> It was written in Spanish (naturally enough) and although the basic procedure stuff is translated the very detailed help stuff isn't yet.  </s>
<s> There are also some pieces missing.  </s>
<s> But comments on these are welcome either in english to the WAI ERT list w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org which is probably more appropriate or here (which I watch).  </s>

<s> For that reason it requires a good implementation of CSS to function properly.  </s>
<s> It is designed to work with Opera, but most of the important features work with Safari or Mozilla (we are working on a testing tool that will allow us to record which features exactly work where).  </s>
<s> It generates reports either as HTML or as EARL - W3C's RDF language for recording test results, using the latest working draft.  </s>
<s> It is available in both english and spanish, and is content-negotiated so you should get whichever version your browser asks for by preference (if neither, the default is spanish).  </s>
