<s> Peepo has advocated for some years the use of the keyboard as means to select links.  </s>
<s> In the latest mozilla browser, when you type a letter, except in a text entry box, it cycles through links that have that letter in their text.  </s>
<s> it seems slightly buggy, but what do you think?  </s>
<s> (course it screws my coding right and proper)  </s>

<s> i found out about this only a few days ago and have been using the so-called 'typeaheadfind' since then quite a lot.  </s>
<s> i haven't found it buggy at all and absolutely love it.  </s>
<s> it's more a Find function then a 'cycling through links' function.  </s>
<s> with the focus on the page you just type a word (or beginning of it) and mozilla jumps to that word.  </s>
<s> F3 finds the next instance.  </s>
<s> it first only looks at links but if you type a '/' (slash) before the word it searches the whole text. it really just saves you bringing up that cumbersome Find dialogue box.  </s>
<s> i don't think it really works for cycling through links. the tab key works better for that.  </s>

<s> Indeed.... I have loved Opera's "inline find" for a long time.  </s>
<s> Sounds like Moz has copped another Opera feature ;-)  </s>
<s> I still haven't found anything that matches Opera's CONTROL+J (which will list all links on the page).  </s>
<s> It also gives you a quick method to see if your links will make sense when read out of context.  </s>

<s> well those are some of the positives, how about disabling for those who are hyperactive, and just cannot stop fiddling with the keyboard?  </s>
<s> its buggy in the sense that for instance 'k' words aren't just those that start with the letter k but also those that include the letter k. I'd expect it to have a few others besides.  </s>
