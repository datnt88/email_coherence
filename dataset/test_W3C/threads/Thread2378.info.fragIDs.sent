<s> Folks, Due to the large amount of spam hitting the http-wg mailing list, I propose to make it closed to postings from non-subscribers unless I hear objections to the contrary.  </s>
<s> What this will mean will be that if a posting arrives from an e-mail address that isn't on a list of acceptable addresses, it will be sent to the list administrator (me) instead of being sent to the list.  </s>
<s> I will then either drop it in the bit-bucket (for spam) or send a message to the poster telling them how to post to a closed list (but see below).  </s>
<s> The initial list of acceptable addresses are the addresses that you folks originally subscribed to the http-wg list with.  </s>
<s> If you want to know your subscription address, just ask me.  </s>
<s> What I can do to make this process a little less painful is to keep an additional list of alternative posting addresses for people whose posting addresses are always different from their subscription address.  </s>
<s> For a _small_ while (like about a week or so), I'll attempt to augment this additional list based on the messages that I see bouncing, and then re-submit the bounced message to the list.  </s>
<s> After that time, you can either unsubscribe and re-subscribe to the list from your new posting address, or you can send me personal e-mail and ask for an alternative posting address to be added for you.  </s>
<s> Questions, comments, objections... feel free to e-mail me.  </s>
<s> (The above functionality assumes that I can get Procmail/SmartList to work as advertised.  </s>
<s> If it fails, all bets are off and we can all suffer spam.) (http-wg list maintainer)-- ange --  </s>
<s> I prefer STRONGLY that you keep the function of being added to the additional list as a permanent service.  </s>
<s> You may even consider automating it :-) There are all sorts of reasons why people post from addresses other  </s>
<s> than their listed address, including: - Subaddressing (the + convention) - Travelling - Multiple accounts - Broken mailers that include hostname of workstation And so on.  </s>
<s> Apart from that, I have no objections, just a sad feeling :-( Harald T. Alvestrand Apps AD  </s>
<s> Maybe i wasn't too clear.  </s>
<s> You can send me an e-mail at any time to have additional posting addresses added.  </s>
<s> The service I was offering for a week or so was noticing failed postings and auto-adding the posters e-mail address to the additional posting address list.  </s>
<s> I don't have the time nor the energy to do this for a longer period.  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> Thanks for your input.  </s>
