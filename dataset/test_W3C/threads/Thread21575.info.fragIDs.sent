<s> Do tell how to get the specification of daml:imports right, please!  </s>
<s> It seems, to me, to involve messy stuff like log:semantics, cyc-style 'lifting', and that sort of thing.  </s>

<s> I don't know what log:semantics and cyc-style lifting are.  </s>
<s> But, as I said on www-rdf-logic, importing an ontology just means incorporating its contents.  </s>
<s> What's hard about that?  </s>
<s> Perhaps we're having some confusion about "importing" vs. "translation."  </s>
<s> The latter is a much more difficult problem, and we know where most of the bodies are buried.  </s>
<s> For instance, ontology 1 wants to use ontology 2, but everything in ontology 2 is temporally scoped, whereas ontology 1 concerns a static world.  </s>
<s> The two have to be merged in such a way that time information is removed from onto-2 assertions without garbling them.  </s>
<s> Please follow up.  </s>

<s> ont:imports isn't just magic syntax.  </s>
<s> It's a property that relates ontology documents.  </s>

<s> Well, our disagreement is clear, but, at least in part, easily settled.  </s>
<s> In our view, 'imports' *is* magic syntax, and not a property of anything.  </s>
<s> If the name is taken already, and is widely agreed to be a "metaproperty" of ontologies, then we will pick a different name for the operation of "including an ontology in a dataset."  </s>
<s> The remaining disagreement appears to concern the meaning of daml:imports when it occurs in an ontology.  </s>
<s> The designers of the language, by writing it as daml:imports "http:// whatever " have indeed made daml:imports an ordinary property that could indeed have subproperties, etc.  </s>
<s> I propose that we undo or bypass this decision and introduce magic syntax for the straightforward concept of just importing another ontology.  </s>
<s> Here's an argument that I think should convince you: Suppose I have It happens that OntU declares my:imports2 daml:subPropertyOf daml:imports whereas OntV declares my:imports1 daml:subPropertyOf daml:imports Does anyone import anything?  </s>
<s> Even in less pathological examples, you have to untangle a bunch of labeled, unordered edges in a graph.  </s>
<s> Some of these edges, according to your view, allow me to import ontologies which would then, and only then, allow me to view some of the other edges as importing yet other ontologies.  </s>
<s> Couldn't the meaning depend on the order in which I made these importations?  </s>
<s> Why insist on this mess when there is a useful and comprehensible piece of magic syntax that we so obviously need?  </s>

<s> no, www-archive is just as publicly readable as www-rdf-logic; in particular, to copy www-archive is to give license to forward it to any other list, point people at it from the archive, etc.  </s>
