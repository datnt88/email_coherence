<s> I have been reading the e-mails for a while now, ever since I came across the WC3's web site and learnt about the importance of web accessibility.  </s>
<s> I was ignorant of the fact that people with disabilities were unable to get  </s>
<s> access to many web pages online.  </s>
<s> I am not near as fluent with html as the people that post messages on this forum, but I would like your help.  </s>
<s> I am in the process of re-doing my web site to make it accessible to as many browsers as possible.  </s>
<s> I put each page I do through the Bobby vaildator and am not satisfied until each page gets 4 stars.  </s>
<s> Would someone be willing to give me feedback on my site?  </s>
<s> I would really appreciate knowing if what I am doing is working.  </s>
<s> I made a copy of the html of my original page if anyone was interested in what it was like before I changed it.  </s>
<s> I am not done with the site, as it is quite extensive.  </s>
<s> I must admit I rather like my site much better as it is now and working without tables is really more satisfying.  </s>
<s> I have given up some little fancy eye-catchers, but I think it is worth it.  </s>
<s> I thank you all in advance for your help and consideration in this matter.  </s>

<s> Dear Ms. Taylor: re: http://www.csinet.net/taymade  </s>
<s> You've undertaken a noble endeavor and lots of work in retrofitting your web site for accessibility.  </s>
<s> Congratulations and thank you!  </s>
<s> Yet one more site on the web I and other disabled people will continue being able to access.  </s>
<s> Because you've asked for feedback, however, I thought I'd take the opportunity you provided to publicly address some issues from which others might benefit as well.  </s>
<s> First, let's take this whole "accessible web page" proposition.  </s>
<s> Just as current web pages don't proclaim themselves to be accessible to the physically abled, it's not necessary to trumpet their accessibility to disabled people.  </s>
<s> If it IS accessible to disabled web surfers, they'll know  </s>
<s> it when they reach the site.  </s>
<s> I'm confident you meant no offense to anyone and probably just wanted to raise awareness to the need for accessibility, but as a disabled person myself, I felt as if I was being singled out in an unnecessary manner while you, basically, patted yourself on the back for being compassionate and sensitive to my and others' needs.  </s>
<s> I hope I haven't offended YOU with MY comments either.  </s>
<s> I only mention it to indicate how even the most helpful people can sometimes go too far in their eagerness.  </s>
<s> Use of the Bobby-approved icon with a link to CAST's site can enlighten people who are curious by its presence.  </s>
<s> In your coding, you've changed the  </s>
<s> ALT attribute on that graphic (which doesn't even appear on your page but is commented in your source-code -- for whose benefit?) to read "Bobby Logo" or something like that, instead of CAST's recommended "Bobby-approved."  </s>
<s> Please don't alter that, as it rather defeats the purpose intended.  </s>
<s> In running your page through Bobby, I noted the site rated four stars, but it DID raise three very important issues for you to consider, most especially the image map (boo!  </s>
<s> hiss!) and your background (even though that was listed last).  </s>
<s> I don't have a permanent screen reader yet, but I suspect your background would cause some confusion for those who use them, as it will keep trying to read the text on the background in addition to the foreground text.  </s>
<s> The fact that you used bold or larger text on the page makes me think it may have been difficult for you to read it against that background, so apply that same thinking when considering the needs of people who can't enlarge or emphasize the text in their browser of choice or necessity.  </s>
<s> Tables, in and of themselves, are not anathema to accessibility, provided certain steps are taken to make them gracefully degrade in text-based browsers like Lynx or when being interpreted by screen readers.  </s>
<s> For some hints about writing tables as well as some techniques for listing links, please refer to This is a little tutorial I put together on creating text- and speech-friendly web sites, not because I think I'm the WWW's answer to accessibility issues, you understand, but because I had to learn these things when I realized *I* could no longer access pages I'd designed!  </s>
<s> I'd also like all of us to broaden our thinking about "accessibility."  </s>
<s> This isn't just some catch-phrase we're using to include people who must use adaptive technology, it means, quite literally, accessibility to EVERY person who reaches a web site.  </s>
<s> That means taking factors like monitor size (resolution) and computer platform or operating system into account as well as browser types.  </s>
<s> In your HTML source code, for instance, you specify a font face called Comic Sans MS.  </s>
<s> This particular font is not generally included in Win 3.* or for people using Macs, so you might want to expand your font face attribute to include fonts typically included in those platforms, such as FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Geneva."  </s>
<s> They CAN see your page, but it will be in their browsers' default font which may affect the way the page renders to them.  </s>
<s> Be aware, too, that animated GIFs can cause sometimes browsers to crash, particularly if they're being viewed by someone using a computer whose resources are already being taxed to the limit.  </s>
<s> As someone with a seizure disorder, I'm often bothered by animation on web sites since things like bandwidth traffic and even my modem's throughput can sometimes affect the speed or consistency of the viewing loop and cause an uncomfortable flickering.  </s>
<s> I notice you include the HTML Writers Guild icon on your site and mention being a member.  </s>
<s> I highly recommend participation in the HWG email lists, particulary hwg-basics and hwg-critique, as those two lists are where web designers learn common-sense techniques which lend themselves to validation and accessibility.  </s>
<s> (BTW, in  </s>
<s> the HWG lists, you'll also learn why you shouldn't use header tags ( H1 through H6 ) to enlarge your text.) Since you included the HTML 4.0 Transitional DTD in your coding, it makes sense to run your page through the W3C validator located at and correct any errors it picks up.  </s>
<s> Validation is VITAL to accessibility, as validation provides the standardization from which adaptive and assistive hardware and software can be created to work for everyone who needs it.  </s>
<s> Finally, may I suggest you familiarize yourself with META tags and their proper use?  </s>
<s> There are any number of places on the Web where you can learn about them (including HWG's resources, I believe), but I found it particularly useful to see what the people who run search engines had to say about them, so followed one of Infoseek's links to the site below: Again, please don't feel as if you're being singled out for criticism.  </s>
<s> It was, in fact, quite brave of you to publicly ask for reviews.  </s>
<s> I, myself, am still retrofitting some of my web sites, so I can fully appreciate the work involved and how it sometimes seems you're never done because someone reminds you about something else.  </s>
<s> I also know how GOOD I feel after I've completed the site, though, so I anticipate that for you as well.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Ree' Dolloff  </s>
<s> Ree', I'm not sure I agree with you.  </s>
<s> (Granted, I'm a "physically abled" person.)  </s>
<s> I think there's value in noting a desire to make a page accessible, beyond simply proclaiming them for the sake of disabled people who might read them.  </s>
<s> One of the biggest benefits is _awareness_.  </s>
<s> This is the same reason you'd put a 'Valid HTML' button your page -- not because you're patting yourself on the back, but because you want to represent something you think is important.  </s>
<s> The web has a long history of such graphics being used for such a purpose, from the 'Valid HTML' mentioned before, to the blue ribbons for free speech.  </s>
<s> If someone comes across the page in question, they may find that Joyce thinks it's important to design an accessible page, and identifies with the movement to make the web accessible to everyone.  </s>
<s> They may be inspired to follow a link and read more about what it really means, and their eyes may be opened to the fact that the web is more than just flashy images on a screen.  </s>
<s> I see value in that.  </s>
<s> In fact, consider Joyce's own statement in her original post:  </s>
<s> Y'see, by increasing awareness of the issue, we can illustrate the importance of universal accessibility as a design consideration.  </s>
<s> You never know who might read your page, decide that what you did is cool, and try to emulate.  </s>
<s> (This happens all the time, for a variety of different types of elements you'd find on a web page.) For this reason, I think it's good to announce that you feel designing for accessibility is important.  </s>
<s> I agree with you on this (obviously), but I think you understate the value in stating that you're striving to create an accessible site.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the kind words about the Guild.  </s>

<s> To which I'm adding:  </s>
<s> Sounds to me like you and I agree more than we differ, Kynn, and are even headed in the same direction.  </s>
<s> Let someone design an icon that's as elegant  </s>
<s> and easy to integrate into any design as the HWG icon, and I'm all for plastering that puppy on the opening page (at least) of every accessible site on the Web, with a link to the WAI site.  </s>
<s> (Ahem...let's hope the quality of accessibility is significantly higher than the quality of design we see on some sites touting the HWG icon, however.  </s>
<s> Even so: free advertising!) I don't know of a more successful marketing technique on the WWW than the Netscape and MSIE icons, so I'm VERY much in favor of a universal symbol pointing to the cause of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Consider this, if you will.  </s>
<s> Ever encountered a web site where the designer's tone seemed rather snooty as the text informed you what browser you needed, or plugins required for viewing the site?  </s>
<s> Almost made you mad sometimes, didn't it, as if some faceless designer somewhere was telling you you couldn't possibly have software and hardware as good as his if you didn't already have the same things he'd used to build his site?  </s>
<s> If you'd had a really bad hair-day, your emotions might have leapt to the assumption this designer was questioning your personal character as well.  </s>
<s> (Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I'm trying to make a point.  </s>
<s> sheepish grin ) "Feel-good" or "Hey, listen up, this is important!" text about accessibility can have the same effect.  </s>
<s> Consider my reaction to what I read on Ms. Taylor's site, after all, and this from someone who had more reason than a casual web surfer to understand her motives and intent!  </s>
<s> Conclusion?  </s>
<s> Linked icon: yes.  </s>
<s> It's simple, succinct and non-judgmental.  </s>
<s> "Look what I did!" text: no.  </s>
<s> Far too many opportunities for misinterpretation or even misrepresentation in what someone might say, left to his or her own devices.  </s>
<s> Now, let's tackle the issue of all the corporations listed as members/supporters of the WAI whose own sites aren't accessible...  </s>

<s> Okay, I agree.  </s>
<s> :)  </s>
<s> I think we need to send out the WAI Black Ops working group and break some kneecaps.  </s>
<s> Oops, wait, I wasn't supposed to talk about that on a public list, right?  </s>
