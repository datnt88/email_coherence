<s> Maybe I'm looking at HTML from a more practical distance.  </s>
<s> What I would prefer for a descriptive language as HTML is: - have elements for certain things a designer needs - have equivalent attributes in all elements each with its specific use and of course always the same attribute for the same use.  </s>
<s> In fact this means ALL elements have ALL attributes with the same use (relevant or not).  </s>
<s> It is typical for a historically grown language to have different attribute in each element each coverring some or some other target.  </s>
<s> I would be happy if the HTML 4.0 would avoid this problem by simply standardizing atrribute defniitons and give them to ALL elements (where useful).  </s>
<s> I don't think adding a TOOL-TIP attributes will help in the long run, since I think they're too close to each other, and content providers will either use it or use ALT, but not both, and in the end, it will become a replacement for ALT, under a new name.  </s>
<s> It is funny how the same argument can bring completely opposite conclusions: ALT and TOOL_TIP will cover different needs so they can exist both and next to each other and hold differend texts.  </s>
<s> The only reason ALT is miss-used (see Al's message) is that there is no nice attribute for the "tool tip" so therefore they took ALT; thanks to the big browser manufacturers !  </s>
<s> Why e.g. is there no ALT in the OBJECT element?  </s>
<s> We do need it there to don't we?  </s>

<s> Dave answered this one yesterday: The OBJECT element doesn't include an alt attribute since the content of the OBJECT element is used as the fallback.  </s>
<s> This allows for rich text descriptions to be given in place including regular HTML elements such as paragraphs, lists and hypertext links.  </s>
<s> The title attribute can be used for a one-liner description of the OBJECT and would normally be used on gui's as a tooltip for the object.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what jaap van lelieveld said:  </s>
<s> I think that Jaap has sounded what is going to be one of our long-running themes.  </s>
<s> It _is_ one of our themes.  </s>
<s> It would be better if HTML were posessed of a smaller vocabulary of more general-purpose terms.  </s>
<s> I believe that this does make a difference in our ability to populate the Web with universal documents that make sense in different browse modes.  </s>
<s> It won't be solved overnight.  </s>
<s> Some of the reasons why the OPTION proposal talks about an OPTGROUP element and not a broader GROUP element have to do with accidents of SGML structure and some of it has to do with more fundamental efficiency reasons why SGML was built that way.  </s>
<s> Another reason it won't happen instantly is that merging different communities' visions to come up with a common vocabulary of the concepts that need to be reflected in the HTML terms is a slow process.  </s>
<s> It's easy and quick to go our own ways.  </s>
<s> Hearing one another is another matter.  </s>
