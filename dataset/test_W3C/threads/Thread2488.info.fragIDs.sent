<s> At different points during the Memphis meetings we talked about the need/possibility of splitting state management into a seperate working group.  </s>
<s> As a straw poll, what do people think the work of such a group would be, and is that work best dealt with in a different group?  </s>
<s> regards, Ted Hardie  </s>
<s> I don't think a new WG is needed with all the salient overhead ... but we do need to take the task 'offline' to a reconsituted and more open subgroup.  </s>
<s> What I think we primarily need is is an offer to host the mail list serving the group along with a list archive.  </s>
<s> (The largely dormant mail list used by the original state managment sub-group is actually run as a sendmail alias with heavy duty manual effort required as a result to add to the list.  </s>
<s> No echo back to submitter, no archive, etc.)  </s>

<s> I'm setting up a mailing list and will send a message to http-wg when it's available (within a day or two).  </s>
