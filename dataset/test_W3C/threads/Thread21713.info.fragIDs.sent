<s> hi Greg - I'm going offline for the rest of the evening now - but I've written a 'validator' for the allowable versions of image descriptions outlined in It's pretty low-tech (I think owl tools could do at least some of what it does), but should be easy to tweak when/if we alter the vocabs, and might be helpful at this stage to ensure various tools are generating useful data for this particular project.  </s>

<s> Hi all, re: "action bengee try to build OWL DL version of the parts of image annotation ontology and publish it somewhere."  </s>
<s> sorry for being so late.  </s>
<s> took me more time than expected to make my modeler export rdfs and reduced owl dl. and I translated parts of the UI to english in case someone should be interested in collaborative vocab-editing.  </s>
<s> I have to leave now but could publish what I've got so far tomorrow.  </s>
<s> (If this is still of any value and you are still interested.  </s>
<s> just send me a mail.) this is what could be done with the tool: - model/describe the terms under discussion (online, moz/ns7-browser req.) - export ontologies for a given namespace as - plain rdfs - owl dl (some basic filtering) - owl full - rdfs+owl (rdfs:Classes with additional owl, like the foaf spec does) some (personal) short comments and thoughts on open issues:  </s>
<s> - foaf:maker vs an:author vs dc:creator - dl would prefer foaf:maker.  </s>
<s> an:author is a subproperty of dc:creator which are both complicated to port to owl dl. it could be done by typing them as owl:ObjectProperties with a range of foaf:Person.  </s>
<s> but if any other (owl) vocab describes dc:creator as a DatatypeProp, we may end up with inconsistent web data and marty mc fly will never get back home.. - using a non-hybrid ObjProperty (e.g. foaf:maker) would IMHO lead to better (i.e. more precise) instance data.  </s>
<s> - dc:title,dc:description:  </s>
<s> - I don't see any owl dl issues here.  </s>
<s> they should be DatatypeProperties.  </s>
<s> - jen golbeck's conference ontology: - no DL problems, vocab could be imported.  </s>
<s> - foaf:mbox_sha1sum: - OWL DL doesn't allow textual InverseFunctionalProperties (IFPs) - we could just skip the IFP typing in an OWL DL version.  </s>
<s> consuming apps could support the semantics at app-level.  </s>
<s> - CC schema - didn't have a look a yet.  </s>
<s> may be same issues as with dc terms.  </s>
<s> - OWL DL at all?  </s>
<s> - depends on the issues above.  </s>
<s> I think it would be nice to offer an additional OWL DL-friendly doc that covers as much of the specification as possible.  </s>
<s> but I'm not sure about that.  </s>
<s> could well be that tool builders don't even go for DL.  </s>
<s> I personally would be happy with a dl-near owl full version.  </s>

<s> Hi Libby, nice validator :)  </s>
<s> I have a question on dc:rights example in You put an example for 'license and rights properties for the metadata' something like: Should this cc:Agent have dc:date ?  </s>
<s> What does this date mean ?  </s>
<s> I think you've taken this fragment from CC's "Extending Creative Commons Metadata" page, and it includes dc:title actually.  </s>
<s> But the page explains this dc:date that "As you can see the copyright holder is a person with a  </s>
<s> URL, a name and a date (of birth)."  </s>
<s> (forget about URL here..)  </s>
<s> If the above dc:date is intended as the copyright date, it should be the date of the creation (of a photo), and thus I think it should be a property of the Image itself, not of Agent (or at least needs another node along with Agent).  </s>
<s> Make sense ?  </s>
<s> Besides it warns me about license failure, the validator works fine.  </s>
<s> Thanks !  </s>

<s> As far as I understand the CC instructions at [1], it is the date of birth of the agent who "owns" the metadata.  </s>
<s> IMHO we could omit dc:date for Agent.  </s>
<s> in CC's third example code they don't mention a dc:date (probably because they are talking about an organization).  </s>
<s> Furthermore cc:Agent seems to be equivalent to foaf:Agent, so we could perhaps state "foaf:Agent owl:equivalentClass/rdfs:subClassOf cc:Agent".  </s>
<s> then we could add a foaf:mbox_sha1sum to cc:Agent to better identify the metadata "owner".  </s>
<s> (don't know if people are going to enter a valid date of birth..)  </s>
<s> another question: is there a difference between the author of the metadata and the agent in  </s>
<s> dc:rights of the metadata?  </s>
<s> if they are (always) the same we could use a nodeID for more compact metadata, e.g.:  </s>
<s> but I don't know if this eases or complicates code generation and reasoning.. I'll shut up now.  </s>

<s> hi Masahide, Benjamin,  </s>
<s> :) thanks Masahide!  </s>
<s> I agree with Benjamin here: it is the date of birth; I think we can (and should, for privacy reasons) omit it; and I think it is important to have an identifying property for the Agent, like mbox_sha1sum/homepage/weblog/page.  </s>
<s> Are there any objections to this?  </s>
<s> If not, I'll make the changes to the examples, the wiki and the validator.  </s>
<s> I *think* they will always be the same.  </s>
<s> That shortens things a bit, which is nice (this technique could also be applied to the license for the image and the dc creator of the image).  </s>
<s> The only difference is that the dc:title of the Agent isn't there any more.  </s>
<s> It was a little odd to use dc:title there in the first place, but if there's a lot of data out there that uses that formulation, that might be a case for continuing to use it.  </s>
<s> Any opinions?  </s>
<s> I don't think so - unless tools are looking out for that dc:title...  </s>
