<s> I'm increasingly concerned with the high technical level of stylesheet proficiency that we seem to be requiring for people to create accessible web pages.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the way the guidelines are written (and this is improved on current rewrites -- but not necessarily enough to solve the problem!), you need to have detailed knowledge of HTML and some CSS experience in order to make an accessible web page.  </s>
<s> Sad to say, this cuts out over half of the people currently designing web pages!  </s>
<s> Stylesheets alone are a confusing new concept to anyone who hasn't tried them -- and that may be enough for them to decide, "accessibility is too hard -- I can't do stylesheets, I don't know what an OBJECT is or even what the difference between a 'tag' and an 'element' is -- so I won't even bother to try to make accessible pages!"  </s>
<s> I'm currently teaching an accessibility course for the HTML Writers Guild's online classes, and that was one of the comments from a student.  </s>
<s> In addition, the Guild's AGI project found that 38% of the respondents thought there was too much HTML 4.0 technical knowledge necessary to understand the guidelines (April 14 version), and 54% -- over half -- were turned off by the emphasis on stylesheets!  </s>
<s> Now, as someone who knows HTML 4.0 pretty well himself, and is decent with stylesheets, I can understand entirely why those need to be part of guidelines, and why they're good and useful features to use when designing web pages.  </s>
<s> But I'm also an expert at this, and do this for a living -- and not everyone falls into that category.  </s>
<s> However, those people still need to make accessible pages!  </s>
<s> Web accessibility is not only for the advanced authors, it something _everyone_ should know!  </s>
<s> But, of course, there's the problem -- how to communicate _only_ what the beginner needs to know, without making them think that's all they'll _ever_ have to understand about accessibility.  </s>
<s> Has anyone dealt with this problem before?  </s>
<s> Do you have a nicely written, "stable", newbie-friendly document that touches on the basics of accessible web design, without overwhelming the casual author with LONGDESC and CSS2 and other unfamiliar concepts?  </s>
<s> If so, can I have a URL? :) If not, am I volunteering myself for more work?  </s>

<s> We need to look at the 80/20 rule and figure out what simple things can be done to make web pages as accessible as possible with the least amount of effort!  </s>

<s> Kynn: You may be interested in a free online workshop on accessible curriculum design which we are offering through the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at U of Toronto.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the three week workshop is to provide a user-friendly introduction to the functioning of adaptive tech, basics of accessible HTML, with optional resources for those who are readly for more.  </s>
<s> I am still working on the content of the course, but it will up on Oct. 13.  </s>
<s> The URL for info on this, and our other online courses related to special education is: We also have an accessible web design service, called Web-Savvy, and have posted a summary list of the WAI standards which we are using as design guidelines.  </s>
<s> This is not a learning tool, but rather a short list of all accessibility standards, divided into "Required Protocols" (Priority 1), or "Recommended Protocols" (Priority 2, 3).  </s>
<s> The "Research and Development" section of the ATRC web site also provides some good summary information on accessible web design: Hope this helps!  </s>
