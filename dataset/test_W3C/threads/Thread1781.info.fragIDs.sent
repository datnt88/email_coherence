<s> Suppose I wanted to capture that adding a resource to version control was part of an activity.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that this could be reflected by making the VERSION-CONTROL method create a VCR whose DAV:checked-in version included that activity in its DAV:activity-set property value.  </s>
<s> It looks like the spec allows but does not require servers to do this (for example) if the VERSION-CONTROL request includes a DAV:activity-set element, or if the request-URL for VERSION-CONTROL is the member of a workspace with a nonempty DAV:current-activity-set property value.  </s>

<s> That is correct.  </s>
<s> It probably would be very reasonable to define both of these behaviors as being required in the next rev of the protocol.  </s>

<s> Actually, the report clearly makes the most sense for depth=0 (perhaps that's what you meant to type?).  </s>
<s> One instance where a non-zero depth parameter would make sense for this report was if you had a collection of workspaces (i.e. each internal member of the collection is a workspace).  </s>
<s> You could do a Depth:1 locate-by-history report, in order to find out where a given version history is in each of those workspaces.  </s>

<s> You managed to confuse me :-) It the request URI is the parent collection, and the scope is the member of this collection, only depth = 1 seems to make sense.  </s>
<s> Depth 0's scope would be just the parent collection, correct?  </s>
<s> The locate-by-history report logically runs against the entire configuration rooted at the request-URL.  </s>
<s> So in that sense, it is a "depth:infinity" operation.  </s>
<s> But that isn't how REPORT is defined.  </s>
<s> REPORT is defined as "being run separately against every resource that satisfies the depth parameter".  </s>
<s> Depth:1 says to "run the request against the resource identified by the request-URL, and then again on each of the internal members of the request-URL."  </s>
<s> But that is never what you want, because you only want the REPORT run once against the configuration identified by the request-URL.  </s>
<s> And that one case where I said that Depth:1 might make sense was just wrong.  </s>
<s> You still run Depth:0 (i.e. just run the REPORT once), and the REPORT will find all VCR's that match that version history in any of the workspaces.  </s>

<s> Hi, two questions regarding the DAV:expand-property REPORT [1]: 1) Scoping (depth header) According to section 3.6 (definition of REPORT method), the depth header will work just as for PROPFIND (depth 0: only request-URI, depth 1: request-URI + internal members, depth infinity: request-URI + all children)?  </s>
