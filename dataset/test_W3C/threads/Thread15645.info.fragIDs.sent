<s> Hello everyone, I posted a link to the working draft on a Dutch webdesign newsgroup.  </s>
<s> We got to talk about the need for a text equivalent for non-text content.  </s>
<s> Two extremes are clear: If you illustrate a principle using an image, you have to provide a text equivalent.  </s>
<s> If you use an image as a spacer image to force the layout, it needs a null equivalent (alt="" in HTML).  </s>
<s> But what about images that are used as an illustration but could be described in words?  </s>
<s> The case we discussed was the largest image on the local history of a village called Denekamp.  </s>
<s> The alt-text for the largest image currently says "Photograph of the backside of the Keizer house with the Saint Nicholas church in the background".  </s>
<s> Both the Keizer house and the Nicholas church are familiar buildings in Denekamp, so both the picture and the alt give a 'Denekamp' feeling to the site for people who are familiar there (which is why these illustrations were chosen).  </s>
<s> One people in the discussion group said he thought this image should have a null alt, because adding this text didn't help accessibility since the function of the image is purely decorative.  </s>
<s> I disagree because I do not want to decide for a blind person that he doesn't need or want this information.  </s>
<s> Also, people who can't see very well and use screenreaders can decide based on the alt if they want to take the trouble to view the image.  </s>
<s> Giving it a null alt means people without visual browsers do not know what they're missing.  </s>
<s> One comment was of the group was: blind people have already accepted that they can't see the images, now I need to accept that as well.  </s>
<s> One person in the newsgroup had a nice litmus test to determine whether you need an alt or a null alt: If the words of the potential text equivalent appear in the text and are illustrated by the image, a null alt suffices.  </s>
<s> If the content of the image is not discussed in the text you have to wonder what the image is doing there in the first place.  </s>
<s> The answer to that question decides whether you need an alt or not.  </s>
<s> If it is just an illustration, a null alt is enough.  </s>
<s> Bottom line: In WCAG 2 we seem to require text equivalents for practically anything you can put into words.  </s>
<s> But does that help accessibility?  </s>
<s> I can describe a dashed line in words but that only annoys people instead of helping them.  </s>
<s> I think we need to think about illustrations whose function is purely decorative.  </s>
<s> I don't think they fall in the category "Non-text content that is designed to create a specific sensory experience" so according to the current formulation it would require a text equivalent.  </s>
<s> But are we sure we're helping people when doing that?  </s>

<s> [Yvette asked what text-equivalents are required for illustrative images that can be expressed in words] Roberto Scano suggested:  </s>
<s> I know that that would solve this case but it's just an example.  </s>
<s> I want to know how we want authors to treat illustrations that don't have subscripts since many designers may not want to add a subscript.  </s>
<s> Especially in level 1, we don't want to tell authors how to present their content so we need to decide what we want as text equivalents for illustrative images that can be expressed in words.  </s>

<s> As I understand it... If the function of the dotted line you mentioned is to divide two blocks of text -- then it does need an alt text and the alt text should be "divider line" or some such.  </s>
<s> It should not describe what the line looks like ('e.g. dotted line") but rather its function.  </s>
<s> If a graphic is on the page to confirm to the viewer that they got to the right page... and the page already has a title -- then it may not have an additional function.  </s>
<s> But if it is to show how nice a place it is -- then it does have a function - and that function should be provided in text.  </s>
<s> You do not need to describe every little detail in the picture.  </s>
<s> (e.g. if it is a picture of the town you don't have to describe the number of buildings, what they look like, the street sign, etc. etc. unless some part of that is critical to the function of the town.  </s>
<s> E.g. could any other picture of another part of the town have been used instead.)  </s>
<s> In general I would think the safer thing to do is to provide short alt text of pictures rather than decide that they have no function.  </s>

<s> Not all dividers are used to divide information on an auditory level.  </s>
<s> Let's talk about shopping carts for a moment.  </s>
<s> Visually I want to separate items in a vertical presentation.  </s>
<s> I can do this by alternating colors or by placing a divider between the items.  </s>
<s> This is done to be nice to the visual shopper or simply for aesthetics.  </s>
<s> There's no need for an auditory response.  </s>
<s> If a divider is meant to divide text on the auditory level as well as visual then I need to use an hr .  </s>
<s> This is where two segments of text are separated to remove the confusion of running together two unrelated paragraphs.  </s>
<s> However, this should be done with CSS so that the text is far enough separated to remove any possible confusion.  </s>
<s> Imagine hearing: "Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.  </s>
<s> The little lamb would follow" "rule" ( hr ) "Peter Piper picked a peck of peppers."  </s>
<s> The hr is heard as "rule", so that now makes it heard as "Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.  </s>
<s> The little lamb would follow rule Peter Piper picked a peck of peppers.".  </s>
<s> Separation of text in the auditory level is extremely hard and would require more than just a simple hr .  </s>
<s> Perhaps hr title="new section follows" would work.  </s>
<s> I'd love to review thoughts on this.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Lee Roberts I agree that it should be done in CSS -- if CSS is used.  </s>
<s> But we do not require it.  </s>

<s> My comment was meant to point out that (in the case I supposed) the function would not be decorative and it should not be null text.  </s>
<s> You mentioned that since it was a visual technique - no auditory technique was needed.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I follow that.  </s>
<s> Can you elaborate?  </s>
<s> If the function was to divide text visually, -- then there would also need to be something to divide the text auditorily.  </s>
<s> Else the two paragraphs would run together -- which they are not supposed to do.  </s>
<s> Yes?  </s>

<s> Director - Trace R &amp; D Center University of Wisconsin-Madison -----Original Message----- I have to disagree with this technique.  </s>
<s> Quoted from Gregg: If the function of the dotted line you mentioned is to divide two blocks of text -- then it does need an alt text and the alt text should be "divider line" or some such.  </s>
<s> It should not describe what the line looks like ('e.g. dotted line") but rather its function.  </s>
<s> This should be a CSS technique and be a border set as dashed.  </s>
<s> Dividers are for visual presentations.  </s>
<s> I don't see a reason for them to be in an aural presentation.  </s>
<s> If it needs to be in an aural presentation it should be an hr .  </s>
<s> Thanks, Lee Roberts -----Original Message----- Behalf Of Gregg Vanderheiden Good comments.  </s>
<s> Here are some random musings as I wait for a delayed plane NOTE: The following are just some comments from me -- not in any way an official finding of the group.  </s>
<s> I think we again have to go back to function.  </s>
<s> As I understand it... If the function of the dotted line you mentioned is to divide two blocks of text -- then it does need an alt text and the alt text should be "divider line" or some such.  </s>
<s> It should not describe what the line looks like ('e.g. dotted line") but rather its function.  </s>
<s> If a graphic is on the page to confirm to the viewer that they got to the right page... and the page already has a title -- then it may not have an additional function.  </s>
<s> But if it is to show how nice a place it is -- then it does have a function - and that function should be provided in text.  </s>
<s> You do not need to describe every little detail in the picture.  </s>
<s> (e.g. if it is a picture of the town you don't have to describe the number of buildings, what they look like, the street sign, etc. etc. unless some part of that is critical to the function of the town.  </s>
<s> E.g. could any other picture of another part of the town have been used instead.)  </s>
<s> In general I would think the safer thing to do is to provide short alt text of pictures rather than decide that they have no function.  </s>
<s> It is rarely true.  </s>
<s> I would ask, why is this picture here.  </s>
<s> Could I put any other random picture here?  </s>
<s> If not, why not.  </s>
<s> Why is it important to use this picture vs a random picture.  </s>
<s> What is it conveying.  </s>

<s> Director - Trace R &amp; D Center University of Wisconsin-Madison -----Original Message----- Behalf Of Yvette P. Hoitink Hello everyone, I posted a link to the working draft on a Dutch webdesign newsgroup.  </s>
<s> We got to talk about the need for a text equivalent for non-text content.  </s>
<s> Two extremes are clear: If you illustrate a principle using an image, you have to provide a text equivalent.  </s>
<s> If you use an image as a spacer image to force the layout, it needs a null equivalent (alt="" in HTML).  </s>
<s> But what about images that are used as an illustration but could be described in words?  </s>
<s> The case we discussed was the largest image on about the local history of a village called Denekamp.  </s>
<s> The alt-text for the largest image currently says "Photograph of the backside of the Keizer house with the Saint Nicholas church in the background".  </s>
<s> Both the Keizer house and the Nicholas church are familiar buildings in Denekamp, so both the picture and the alt give a 'Denekamp' feeling to the site for people who are familiar there (which is why these illustrations were chosen).  </s>
<s> One people in the discussion group said he thought this image should have a null alt, because adding this text didn't help accessibility since the function of the image is purely decorative.  </s>
<s> I disagree because I do not want to decide for a blind person that he doesn't need or want this information.  </s>
<s> Also, people who can't see very well and use screenreaders can decide based on the alt if they want to take the trouble to view the image.  </s>
<s> Giving it a null alt means people without visual browsers do not know what they're missing.  </s>
<s> One comment was of the group was: blind people have already accepted that they can't see the images, now I need to accept that as well.  </s>
<s> One person in the newsgroup had a nice litmus test to determine whether you need an alt or a null alt: If the words of the potential text equivalent appear in the text and are illustrated by the image, a null alt suffices.  </s>
<s> If the content of the image is not discussed in the text you have to wonder what the image is doing there in the first place.  </s>
<s> The answer to that question decides whether you need an alt or not.  </s>
<s> If it is just an illustration, a null alt is enough.  </s>
<s> Bottom line: In WCAG 2 we seem to require text equivalents for practically anything you can put into words.  </s>
<s> But does that help accessibility?  </s>
<s> I can describe a dashed line in words but that only annoys people instead of helping them.  </s>
<s> I think we need to think about illustrations whose function is purely decorative.  </s>
<s> I don't think they fall in the category "Non-text content that is designed to create a specific sensory experience" so according to the current formulation it would require a text equivalent.  </s>
<s> But are we sure we're helping people when doing that?  </s>
