<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> [Geoff Responded:]  </s>
<s> Yes, what you said matches how I thought Version Controlled Collections work, but does not match the specification.  </s>
<s> A Version Controlled Collection DOES have bindings to Version Controlled Resources and this is fine, I understand this and it makes sense.  </s>
<s> A Collection Version (for example the DAV:checked-in version of the Version Controlled Collection) has bindings to Version Histories.  </s>
<s> But the issue I was reporting was that section 10.2 defines the bindings of a COLLECTION VERSION to be bindings to Version Controlled Resources.  </s>
<s> This is incorrect and does not match what you said in your reply.  </s>
<s> I propose we make two changes: 1.  </s>
<s> It takes some time to understand section 14, it would have helped if the diagram was complete and showed that /x is a Version Controlled Collection, and that V2 of VH14 is a Collection Version.  </s>
<s> 2. The current text of 10.2 says: Collection Version Resource A "collection version resource", or simply "collection version", captures the content, dead properties, and version-controlled bindings of a version-controlled collection (see Section 14).  </s>
<s> A version-controlled binding is a binding to a version-controlled resource.....  </s>
<s> I propose we make this clearer and say: Collection Version Resource A "collection version resource", or simply "collection version", captures the content, dead properties, and bindings to the Version History Resources identified in the the version-controlled bindings of a version-controlled collection (see Section 14).  </s>
