<s> I've made the results from running the current approved OWL semantic tests using the current CVS version of Jena2 available here: These are automated tests.  </s>
<s> Given the earlier discussion on tests with reduced comprehension support then we've added a simple query processor which implements the comprehensions required for the query.  </s>
<s> No manual intervention is required.  </s>
<s> Note that the rule-based OWL inference support in Jena2 is only aimed at OWL/Lite so tests that require OWL/DL features such as complementOf and unionOf have not been included (we do include incomplete support for oneOf and hasValue due to user requests).  </s>
<s> Of the relevant positive entailment tests we are incomplete on four tests: description-logic 661 &amp; 662 I5.2-006 (defining union within OWL-lite) I5.8-010 (0 is the only nonNegative and nonPositive integer) The latter failure could be remedied.  </s>
<s> The negative entailment tests are reported as passing in the weak sense that we do not find the entailment.  </s>
<s> These should probably be reported as incomplete rather than pass.  </s>

<s> republished to include this.  </s>
<s> They should indeed; will you please change this?  </s>
<s> As I understand it, passing a N.E.T. means proving that the entailment does not hold in the given logic (DL, Full, Lite).  </s>
<s> Calling it incomplete at least says it's not a "Fail", and the output link can give details about how thorough the search for a decision was (even though finding one would have indicated a failure).  </s>
<s> Or you can just skip them, since you know it'll never pass.  </s>

<s> Done.  </s>
<s> I've chosen to skip them since that seems to be what other similar systems have done.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> I think there is distinct value in reporting an incomplete here as opposed to being silent.  </s>
<s> The plausibility of the logical correctness of the tests is enhanced by the number of reasonable thorough systems that do not fail these tests.  </s>
