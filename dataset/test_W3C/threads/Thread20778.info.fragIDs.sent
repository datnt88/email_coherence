<s> Hello, after several uninstall/reinstall attempts my rather baffled guessing is: In contrary to version 5.1, installation of WindowsNT-5.2a to another path as /Programm Files/Amaya/ gives a menu bar without the menus for editing.  </s>
<s> Same with shortcuts: editing disabled somehow.  </s>
<s> If this is true and intended, I`d like to suggest some note during installation.  </s>

<s> Normally the installation path shouldn't perturb the Amaya application provided that configuration files have the right relative position: the binary amaya.exe is looking for configuration files by relative paths "..\..\config\" or "..\..\amaya\".  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> One should try another time to "cure" strange things...  </s>
<s> It works now and Amaya behaves as it should either displaying all menus or refusing to start when some configuration files are not found.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your reply.  </s>
