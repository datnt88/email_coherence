<s> I can't speak for Steve of course, but I often had something like: the MT forces us to interpret a literal as something, but what?  </s>
<s> (not yet so what) Some (including myself) say that it denotes itself, others say that it denotes the value of a function eg:dt(lexical-form) (and still others would maybe say that there should be more function arguments taken into account).  </s>
<s> The former is a minimal interpretation and kind of leaves the meaning of a statement determined by the statement verb, which is why I like it.  </s>
<s> The latter can be achieved with datatyped literals such as e.g. used in eg:s eg:p eg:dt"abc" .  </s>
<s> eg:s eg:p (eg:dt "abc") .  </s>
<s> eg:s eg:p eg:dt("abc") .  </s>
<s> As far as I can see both stances use different models but *could* have intended the same and therefore want to use the same property name, which looks like a bug to me (and which is not the fault of the MT).  </s>

<s> Just the opposite, I think it is essential we continue to have non-typed inline literals that are "interpreted" at the application level.  </s>
<s> I.e. applications that currently use bare literals should continue to work as expected and not require re-writing.  </s>
