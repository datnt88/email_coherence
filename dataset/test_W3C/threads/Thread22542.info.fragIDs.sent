<s> First a quick thank-you to Don Park for his initiative.  </s>
<s> Here are some more issues ... 1.  </s>
<s> What should the behaviour of, HTMLTableRowElement.getRowIndex() HTMLTableRowElement.setRowIndex() be where the relevant row is not in the tree?  </s>
<s> 2. What should the behaviour of, HTMLTableRowElement.getSectionRowIndex() HTMLTableRowElement.setSectionRowIndex() be where the relevant row is not in the tree, or not a child of a table section element.  </s>
<s> 3. What should the behaviour of, HTMLTableCellElement.getCellIndex() HTMLTableCellElement.setCellIndex() be where the relevant cell is not in the tree?  </s>
<s> 4. What should the behaviour of, HTMLOptionElement.getIndex() HTMLOptionElement.setIndex() be where the relevant option is not in the tree?  </s>
<s> 5. Exactly which element types are returned by HTMLFormElement.getElements()?  </s>
<s> All control elements (eg.  </s>
<s> including LABEL , FIELDSET etc. elements) or just the INPUT , BUTTON , TEXTAREA , ISINDEX and SELECT elements.  </s>
<s> 6. According to the HTML 4.0 spec, some elements have a case-insensitive name attribute, whereas others have a case-sensitive name attribute.  </s>
<s> Should  </s>
<s> HTMLDocument.getElementsByName() and HTMLCollection.getNamedItem() respect this distinction?  </s>
<s> I've also got one query on REC.  </s>
<s> Unlike all the other HTMLCollection attributes, HTMLTableRowElement.cells is not readonly ... is this a typo?  </s>

<s> I wasn't aware that there was anything in HTML4 that had a case-sensitive name; could you provide an example or two?  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> Following attributes in the HTML layer will likely be made read-only: HTMLOptionElement.index HTMLCellElement.cellIndex HTMLRowElement.rowIndex  </s>
<s> HTMLRowElement.sectionRowIndex  </s>
<s> HTMLRowElemetn.cells  </s>
<s> It is not clear what their value should be when they are not in the relevant context (not in the tree or not inside appropriate ancestors).  </s>
<s> Docuverse DOM SDK uses -1 to represent the middle finger.  </s>
<s> g  </s>
<s> I forget where I got the list from but Docuverse DOM SDK returns: button, fieldset, input, isindex, label, legend, object, option, select, textarea.  </s>
<s> It depends on the the collection.  </s>
<s> Frankly, I missed this bit of 'finesse' in the DOM SDK.  </s>
<s> See above.  </s>
<s> Best, Don Park Docuverse  </s>

<s> Neither was I, until a couple of weeks ago when I started going through the spec with a fine-tooth comb.  </s>
<s> From the spec: Case insensitive: BUTTON FRAME IFRAME INPUT MAP OBJECT PARAM (language dependent) SELECT TEXTAREA Case sensitive: A APPLET META PARAM (language dependent) I found the easiest way to track this down was via the 'Index of Attributes' section.  </s>
