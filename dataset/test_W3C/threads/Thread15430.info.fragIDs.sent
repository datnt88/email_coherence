<s> Well, here is one point I was too timid to raise on Thursday with 5 minutes left.  </s>
<s> If services providers are pushing a range of adverts most of which are simple gifs with an alt text.  </s>
<s> Then how can the site using the advertising know for certain that there are not one or two inaccessible ads and hence ruining their conformance.  </s>
<s> I have been thinking about it, and since most sites use iframe to have ad content served up to their site.  </s>
<s> This means that all the things we are asking them to stop ad content from doing they have no control over.  </s>
<s> This brings us full circle to that the ad content providers have to comply.  </s>
<s> I am also afraid, however trivial it seems this is an issue we have to deal with thoroughly we can not sweep it under the carpet.  </s>
<s> The reason I say this is that whatever our own thoughts on the matter WCAG is quickly becoming the defacto standard of what reasonable levels of accessibility.  </s>
<s> I can see a situation where someone finds a site inaccessible, sues the site, who sue the ad provider.  </s>
<s> This of course would lead to a whole lot of wrangling over what is accessible and what isn't, and WCAG being used to justify two cases at once.  </s>
<s> Whatever legal decision happened could easily put acceptable accessibility in a direction we do not agree with.  </s>
<s> So as political as it is, I suggest that we make sure whatever our line is on this is rock solid.  </s>
<s> This I don't think is.  </s>
<s> So I guess I have to fall back on what Cynthia said, this is something EO should look at.  </s>
<s> If they can get conformance (not really a hard thing) from the ad providers there will be much less of problem.  </s>

<s> Hi Charles, There was a long discussion at the meeting (60 min) on this and the group conclusion was that ads differed from other content on the page for a number of reasons. 1 - you pay for other content and can choose it.  </s>
<s> With Ads, they pay you and you usually subscribe to a service.  </s>
<s> You don't control the ads, nor do you know what they will be like. 2 - if you can't find a service that has an accessible form of something, you can skip that feature on your site.  </s>
<s> You can't skip the ads if that is what is paying for your sites existence.  </s>
<s> 3 - there are often accessible forms of most things.  </s>
<s> There are only limited Ad services.  </s>
<s> If a lucrative one existed that had only accessible ads... then that would be great.  </s>
<s> But doesn't seem to be the case.  </s>
<s> If none exists, the sites only options are to post accessible ads or shut down site.  </s>
<s> (or, of course, ignore any accessibility).  </s>
<s> 4 - People coming to the site are coming for the content there.  </s>
<s> Not the ads.  </s>
<s> If the ads are not accessible (but do not block access to the information on the site), then the individuals did not miss anything that they came for.  </s>
<s> [ Note that this exception on ads did not apply to ads that the site had control of.  </s>
<s> For example, ads for that companies own products.] 5 - if the people are interested in the Ads, they could go to the ad site.  </s>
<s> The ads would continue to have to meet the requirements of WCAG to be considered accessible.  </s>
<s> But he site could be accessible if the third party ads were not..... as long as the ads did not block access to the site content.  </s>
<s> I think I captured most of the content of the working group discussion.  </s>
<s> If I missed a point - someone please let me know, or post a correction.  </s>

<s> Hi Gregg, thanks for the explanation.  </s>
<s> In summary I am still opposed to the exception for the reasons I have given in the past.  </s>
<s> A little more detail below for anyone unfamiliar with the rough outline of the argument.  </s>
<s> I think that the exception is contrary to the goal of the guidelines, and will weaken rather than strengthen accessibility, by providing a means for claiming that some content is an advertisement and can  </s>
<s> therefore claim conformance despite being manifestly not in conformance with the guidelines as they would apply.  </s>
<s> I also believe that such an exemption is inappropriate in the guidelines - if it makes sense at all, it would make sense in material directed at policy makers, providing further guidance on issues that might arise in implementing the guidelines in a policy framework.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, these guidelines are not a law to be imposed on everyone, but a technical specification which describes what makes something accessible.  </s>
<s> If there are good policy reasons for granting exemption (just as if there are good policy reasons for requiring conformance in the first place) it is the job of policy makers to decide that, rather than for the working group to precipitate that decision.  </s>
<s> For some legal systems such an exemption made by the working group would be incompatible with the law, which would potentially result in a law requiring that certain parts of the guidelines be ignored in favour of better accessibility, which is embarassing as well as putting the problem in the wrong place.  </s>
<s> The arguments given below apply to other important services, from search engine results to a third-party travel application provided for a global intranet (these are two real applications I am dealing with in a multinational company that I hope will become a great example).  </s>
<s> The exception might be the argument that people don't go to a site for advertising, but I don't see the point as relevant.  </s>
<s> People who find the ad inaccessible are unlikely to go to the site that made it, and there is a strong argument that the relevant destination is in any event advertising and should get the exemption.  </s>
<s> Likewise, a global organisation may not have any more control over their own advertising material than they do over others', since it is likely to come from an external provider (i.e. not the unit responsible for the website, which may be a separate company in another country).  </s>

<s> Normally I'd agree to this point of view (because it's only consequent), but in this case I think the considered way is best.  </s>
<s> First of all -- will someone pass on integrating (thus using) ads if they are inaccessible?  </s>
<s> I don't think so, because online advertising is still a uncontrollable (often in relation to delivered source and content) must (despite its humble efficiency).  </s>
<s> So, if this topic is being handled carefully (e.g. by treating adverts as an exception), not only ad providers will possibly improve their source (code) while a growing awareness of Accessibility importance offers an incentive to measure up to this level -- and this will maybe rather succeed than trying to force external content or ad partners to deliver valid and/or accessible source.  </s>
