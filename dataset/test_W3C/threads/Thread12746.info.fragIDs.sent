<s> First, I would like to explain why there are suddenly several emails where I disagree with some aspects of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Basically, work had consumed my time so I could not review the last call for revision.  </s>
<s> Now that I am making time, in part, because I am conducting a quality assurance review of our site at work to identify the deficiencies and make a hit list of items to be repaired.  </s>
<s> I am also reviewing this in part to respond to the Justice Department's survey on Rehabilitation Act Section 508.  </s>
<s> My concern is these Guidelines are going to be adopted verbatim by the United States Government without regard to content and what it entails, implementation, training, and budgetary support.  </s>
<s> Therefore, my suggestion would be: 1.  </s>
<s> To come out with the next revision in the fall.  </s>
<s> These guideline would be more understanding and supportive of the web development community.  </s>
<s> We need their support - not make an enemy of them!  </s>
<s> 2. Provide for a large scale meeting to discuss issues line by line.  </s>
<s> Of course, we would need to submit issues and distribute for review prior to the event.  </s>
<s> The purpose would be to come to terms on the language or show stoppers.  </s>
<s> 3. Discuss how people are going to be trained 4. Discuss how trainers are going to be certified.  </s>
<s> I do have two major problems with the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> I do not believe Guidelines is an appropriate description.  </s>
<s> I would suggest specification; however, I do not know what the W3C's charter will permit it to do.  </s>
<s> 2. I have a major problem where the Guidelines state that CSS must be used.  </s>
<s> For example, "3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]".  </s>
<s> First, the entire world will not be using CSS for many years to come.  </s>
<s> One cannot make the assumption that all offices will switch.  </s>
<s> Unless you are in a controlled browser environment, web developers will not switch, because there are simply too many problems with CSS browsers.  </s>
<s> Second, there is simply too much HTML 3.2 and 4 code out there and companies and government cannot afford the cost to switch.  </s>
<s> Plus the skill sets are much different as we have web developers that come from various backgrounds (wrieters, graphics, HTML coders, programmers, system adminstrators).  </s>
<s> This is much different form the Client -Server world!  </s>
<s> There was also a group who supported this position when the QuickTip card was being drafted, see, "Page organization.  </s>
<s> Use headings, lists, and consistent structure.  </s>
<s> Use CSS for layout and style where possible."  </s>
<s> Some people lobbied to ensure "Use CSS for layout and style where possible" was added.  </s>
<s> People who think everyone must use CSS and support the Guidelines position as such, must be living in an ivory tower.  </s>
<s> The real world doesn't think this way.  </s>
<s> Life in the trenches is very much different.  </s>
<s> Most office web sites are just now getting budget support.  </s>
<s> However, many office web site are run by secretaries who have this as cross duty.  </s>
<s> If we are going to say something like "Use CSS" then we need to say HTML 3.2 and 4 is still "OK" as long as you support the guidelines and do not use deprecated tags AND you can only get Double-A if you use tables for formating.  </s>
<s> Or we can say CSS is strongly encourage, however, not required.  </s>
<s> The way it stands now I would need to justify why i am not using CSS and this is not made clear in the guidleines.  </s>
<s> So managers are going to read "3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation" and say do it without undersanding why.  </s>
<s> As this is a Priority 2 item and the Federal Governement is expected to adopt double-A conformance level, then web developers have a lot of explaing to do and we have just put a rope on their neck and kicked out the chair.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, we must resolve these and other conflicts soon and offer training, so we can prepare people to adopt the Guidelines!  </s>
<s> Escpecailly since the Federal Govenrment will be adopting these soon!  </s>
<s> Just think of the number of sites this will influenece and the trikle down affect to State and Local governments and to contractors and web design houses that must market to the Federal Market - thats is a significant number!  </s>
<s> I appreciate your time to here my comments, but also want to add that I think everyone has done a super job to get us here, especially those people writing the Specifications, excuse me, Guidelines grin .  </s>
<s> rob.  </s>
<s> I do not doubt the CSS's usability.  </s>
<s> I question why I am being forced to use CSS to obtain a Double A conformance level.  </s>
<s> I can make a web page that is accessible using HTML 3.2 and 4. Before the recommendation, I had done that at Department of Labor before CSS was widely used, see a layout without tables for formatting and in HTML 4 Transitional.  </s>
<s> This was the closest thing to adopting over 90% of the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> BUT I used HTML not CSS.  </s>
<s> If I were still there, I would be livid about Checkpoint 3.3.  </s>
<s> Now all of a sudden I have to switch because another language is wanted.  </s>
<s> CSS has design guidelines and so does HTML and both must be properly applied.  </s>
<s> I cannot support a recommendation that disallows other methodologies that can be made accessible.  </s>
<s> By the way, how does Checkpoint 3.3 apply when I want to make a HTML page that is text only and use HTML 3.2 with no deprecated items and follow the rest of the guidelines except Checkpoint 3.3?  </s>
<s> For example, except for Checkpoint 3.3, I am Triple A. This is like telling me I MUST purchase a new car when an used one will do!  </s>
<s> This is a note to Jamie (Are you monitoring?):  </s>
<s> Now that you are running the Davis-Bacon site, if it wasn't for checkpoint 3.3, how close are you to Triple A conformance? Basically, my position is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) should change Checkpoint 3.3 to say, "Use CSS where possible."  </s>
<s> If you have not read the WCAG yet, then wake-up and realize that you will be required to use CSS to obtain a Double A conformance rating.  </s>
<s> If you are associated with the United States Government then expect the Federal Government to adopt the WCAG next year.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have any comments on this?  </s>
<s> Your opinions do matter.  </s>
<s> Are there any other government efforts or other efforts to adopt Double A? rob  </s>
<s> Robert, I don't think you need to worry quite so much.  </s>
<s> The guidelines state "use CSS to control layout and presentation".  </s>
<s> This means it is possible to create a page which does not use any particular presentation control (which is what I normally do) and to attach a stylesheet which provides safe styling if you want.  </s>
<s> It is also possible to do this for  </s>
<s> the "text-only" version - actually, a text-only version is not a very good solution to accessibility, since the requirement is for an accessible version, and in many cases the images, audio, and other interesting features are actually part of the page's accessibility features, and need a mechanism to transform gracefully.  </s>
<s> As an example, a piece of music which is played is accessible to a blind person using any common audio player (it is fairly easy to have one connected to Lynx) and a text-only version is likely to remove access to that audio.  </s>
