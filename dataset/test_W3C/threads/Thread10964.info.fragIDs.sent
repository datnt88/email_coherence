<s> A straw poll indicates the question needs further discussion in the work group.  </s>
<s> B.9 Should XML require system and public identifiers to be FORMAL (13.5)?  </s>
<s> I'd still like to keep at least a subset of the nice clean FSI syntax.  </s>
<s> What is the functionality you want from FSIs that you can't get from URLs?  </s>
<s> At least better opportunities for indirection.  </s>
<s> How do FSIs offer this?  </s>
<s> What makes you think URLs can't offer indirection?  </s>

<s> What makes you think URLs can't offer indirection?  </s>
<s> James URLs can provide indirection (or at least a server can) but they bind the resolution protocol at the time the name is assigned.  </s>
<s> Using URLs as the only syntax for system identifiers doesn't allow other forms of name to be used later on.  </s>
<s> If we specify FSI syntax, and then restrict the FSIs to be URLs, there is a nice path to more-robust identifiers at no more cost than we incur by implementing URLs to begin with.  </s>
<s> Similarly, if we allow FPIs and restrict our catalogs to mapping FPI - FSI, the implementation will be a lot simpler than current SGML implementations.  </s>
<s> We need not even use the SGML/Open catalog syntax if it makes parsing to hard.  </s>
<s> Having the FSI syntax to allow extension seems easy and foresighted to me.  </s>
<s> FPI's may add complexity (in that they need to be resolved, but if we have external entities at all, FPIs should be available -- We need the slot in the syntax if we ever want to have the FPI/FSI distinction -- and it is a critical distinction.  </s>
<s> So I guess I think we need to FPIs into the syntax even if we consciously decide not to specify how they should be resolved.  </s>
<s> (Assuming that we have external entities at all.  </s>
<s> On that question I can't make up my mind.) If we are to eliminate the distinction between FPI and FSI (or URN/URL or pointer/name, choose your terminology), then we would have to eliminate URLs and other pointers I think, and standardize on FPIs only.  </s>
<s> However, this would fly in the face of familiarity, and be hard to implement, so we should probably avoid the high road on this issue.  </s>
<s> But making it impossible to ever do the right thing and use location independent naming seems a high price to bear.  </s>
