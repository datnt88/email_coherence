<s> Related to the previous message (technique 5.5.1 Check for a valid summary attribute, in response to Len's comments from [1] about 21 december version [2]), the WCAG group concluded that 5.5 applied also to the CAPTION element.  </s>
<s> Their conclusion was incorporated into the 11 February HTML Techniques for WCAG document [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#tables].  </s>
<s> I propose: Technique 5.5.2 [priority 3] Check TABLE elements for valid CAPTION element Discussion Status: under discussion Evaluation: Verify that the TABLE element should have a valid CAPTION element.  </s>
<s> Example of a message to be displayed: This TABLE does not have a CAPTION: A table caption describes the nature of the table in one to three sentences.  </s>
<s> For example, "Cups of coffee consumed by each senator."  </s>
<s> Repair Technique: Allow the author to enter a CAPTION.  </s>

<s> If you have a layout table you don't want to have a caption that is rendered.  </s>
<s> Is summary enough in this case or do we need to have a display: none for the caption in the stylesheet or what?  </s>

<s> This actually raises a WCAG issue that's bothered me for a while.  </s>
<s> I think that, instead of discarding tables for purposes of layout, we simply provide a standard way to define something as a "layout table".  </s>
<s> For example, by adding a class or attribute to the TABLE declaration.  </s>
<s> Especially since CSS handles tables poorly.  </s>
<s> This actually goes beyond WCAG and gets into HTML4 land.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, we can put "layout" into the summary, as was already suggested earlier.  </s>
