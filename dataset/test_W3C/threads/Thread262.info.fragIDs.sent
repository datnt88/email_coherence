<s> Hi - new to the list - used Tidy a few times to instamagically clean up nasty code -- but found the Windows port kinda klunky - the DOS version was more simple.  </s>
<s> *LOVE* the Mac version, btw.  </s>
<s> Anyway - if the Tidy gods would have a look at this and point out any obvious errors or have other suggestions, I'd much appreciate it.  </s>
<s> Have a look (temporary URL!)  </s>

<s> How would you like to write a tutorial for the Mac version grin ?  </s>
<s> A common complaint is new users don't always figure out on their own how to use the program.  </s>
<s> I intend to improve the usability and user interface, and one day write "real" documentation.  </s>
<s> Looks pretty good.  </s>
<s> A couple of minor grammatical errors.  </s>
<s> Fortunately the MS-DOS version of Tidy is pretty simple to use.  </s>
<s> However people should  </s>
<s> really read the Overview.html  </s>
<s> page you point to, in order to get the best out of Tidy.  </s>
<s> I would suggest perhaps adding the use of I/O redirection, and avoiding the use of the -m option.  </s>
<s> e.g. tidy -i -wrap 400 -upper -f errors.txt  </s>
<s> foo.html  foo.out Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> ?hm, we are talking here of the Win32 Command line Version of HTML Tidy, not the MS-DOS Version, this should be corrected.  </s>
<s> BTW: http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/tidy.exe seems to be the 27.  </s>
<s> September Version, not as expected the 2x.  </s>
<s> October Version.  </s>

<s> Yes, I guess you are correct on this one - being a Mac user, I rarely run MS-DOS applications, and when I do, it is under Windows 9x.  </s>
<s> So I assume you can't actually run this version on older configurations running DOS only.  </s>
<s> First I think you have the URL wrong - while using the above URL does  </s>
<s> indeed download a file (I didn't bother completing the download), it is not a published URL (that I could find) on the main Tidy page.  </s>
<s> All the links to the Win32 Command line version of Tidy, from the main Tidy page are : Secondly, I downloaded this very file a day or two ago, and it is in fact the 22 Oct 99 version.  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> Yes you're right.  </s>
<s> I think Dave should delete this one (and setup a redirect to ../tidy.exe).  </s>

<s> I think you should explain the configuration file options which are *much* more extensive.  </s>
<s> Furthermore you can now access these via the command line using the --name syntax.  </s>
<s> In addition, the binary you link to is for Win95/98/NT/2000.  </s>
<s> However for older systems, you should check out the Tidy386 port which is maintained by Nick B, see: Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>
