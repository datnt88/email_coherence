<s> On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question.  </s>
<s> A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to not prescribing any particular behavior.  </s>
<s> C.16 When given an incomplete DTD, should XML parsers assume all attributes are implicity declared CDATA, or should some attribute names cause other assumptions (e.g. attributes with the same name as some type of declared value might be assumed to have that declared value)?  </s>
<s> Implicit CDATA.  </s>
<s> There's no benefit in leaving this undefined, and being smart about it will just make worse trouble.  </s>
<s> Of course, "id" will already be a fixed, undeclared, universally accessible attribute anyway; so the "smartness" doesn't get you much.  </s>
<s> Anyway, even if we make the mistake of cluttering XML with NMTOKEN and its ilk, the parser must assume CDATA absent a declaration.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we will be annoying the user with errors (they may not be able to get rid of) to the effect that "you meant this to be an NMTOKEN, and it's not".  </s>
<s> That's the kind of error message that makes me give my monitor the finger.  </s>

<s> In every document processing system, SGML or not, there is always a full DTD.  </s>
<s> If the user isn't allowed to specify it (as he can in SGML), the implementors create it for him (usually without documenting it).  </s>
<s> XML should always have a full DTD, even though it should not be necessary to specify it completely for an individual document.  </s>
<s> Otherwise you have tag salad (with attribute dressing), and you lose SGML tool compatibility as well.  </s>
<s> It should be a straightforward job to define the omitted element types and attributes.  </s>
<s> I've made some suggestions in other postings as a starting point for discussion.  </s>
<s> "Incomplete DTD" should only mean "Incompletely-specified DTD".  </s>

<s> I agree with the CDATA default.  </s>
<s> Because ID/IDREF is an important concept, I would like to see default names for them so that they could be processed as something other than CDATA.  </s>
<s> I don't care too much about the names, but brevity would be preferred.  </s>
<s> Even NAME and HREF work for me.  </s>
