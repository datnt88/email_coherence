<s> DanBri, Guus, I'm getting my head around the TP week... wondering when/if to present GRDDL at the SWIG meeting and/or the BPDWG meeting.  </s>
<s> (DanBri, I'll be in touch separately about a possible RDF calendar task force update.)  </s>
<s> I owe my time to the TAG on Tuesday, so I'd the SWIG discussed GRDDL on Monday if at all.  </s>
<s> EricM, thanks for the pointer from to the SWIG meeting.  </s>
<s> Now it's easy to find, but the BPDWG ftf agenda is still kinda hard to find.  </s>
<s> I still have to go back to Ralph's message of 2 Feb to the CG to find it... I see RDF-XHTML slated (v 1.6 2004/02/02 20:08:32) for Friday morning... hmm... that conflicts with an invitation to a Voice WG meeting to talk about TAG stuff.  </s>
<s> Hmm... still no "this is different from the best practices meeting" on the SWIG page, danbri... nor vice versa, Ralph/Guus.  </s>
<s> So I'm aware of at least one piece of feedback pending on each of those FTF meeting pages.  </s>
<s> Please address that issue and as many others as you can in the next day or so and let me know.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the W3C Tech Plenary in Cannes 1-5 Mar 2003?  </s>
<s> Pretty please?  </s>

<s> [soory the late reply] I would wecome such a talk for the SWBPD meeting.  </s>
<s> The Friday morning would be the most approriate spot, I guess.  </s>
<s> Ralph, anything you can do about this?  </s>
<s> Guus  </s>

<s> now links to http://www.w3.org/2004/03/04-SWBPD  </s>
<s> I note that the latter is Member-ACL'd.  </s>
<s> It would be useful to have this public, so that SW IG members can see what's planned for thurs/fri.  </s>
<s> Is there any particular reason not to have it public?  </s>
<s> I'd like to put this on the SW IG agenda too.  </s>
<s> Can we have it be public, rather than having to cite earlier (public) versions?  </s>
<s> Re GRDDL, I'd welcome a lightning talk on this work.  </s>
<s> Any prefs re monday vs tuesday?  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
