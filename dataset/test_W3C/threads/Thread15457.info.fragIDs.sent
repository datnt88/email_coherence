<s> I talked to Ralph Swick this afternoon (after reading the latest RDF doc) and he told me their goal was indeed to be able to describe things like dictionary type and structure from the link to the dictionary itself (i.e. before fetching the dictionary itself).  </s>
<s> Is wasn't clear in the current RDF spec and should be made clearer in next version (he pointed me at the fact that RDF can assert anything about anything, and a LINK is something).  </s>
<s> He also thinks that dictionary themselves should be expressed in RDF syntax, but that's another topic.  </s>
<s> I think this doesn't close the issue really and we should articulate a requirement proposal, rather than a solution, regarding the need of pointing to accessiblity-relevant dictionary (like phonetic for speech browser).  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> I agree we want to arrive at a requirement statement.  </s>
<s> I still want some worked examples.  </s>
<s> I believe that we need this because we are likely to be facing a decision between asking for functions in HTML vs. trusting that the functions are covered outside HTML.  </s>
<s> To make that decision responsibly, we need one more level of investigation into the alternatives.  </s>
<s> Specific functions which would be good to cover in the examples: - how browser recognizes that a dictionary is useful w.r.t. an HTML document without explicit mention in document.  </s>
<s> - how author indicates that a dictionary is to be preferred for a specific use w.r.t. current document (, current entity).  </s>
<s> - Repeat above two for stylesheets.  </s>
<s> - how browser detects text resources associated with an image.  </s>
<s> - how does the author community converge on a taxonomy for distinguishing different text resources associated with the same image in a widely-recognized way?  </s>
<s> I see this as an action item which could be performed outside the HC working group in response to a request from the HC working group.  </s>
<s> If we don't do it in HTML because RDF does it for us, we will probably need to put "How to do it in RDF" in the Guidelines for site managers and browsers.  </s>
<s> I don't know who should lead the work.  </s>
<s> I believe that there needs to be a team because we need to cover the following classes of expertise: - RDF expertise - HTTP expertise including the new Internet-Draft on Alternative indications (headers) - Someone with in-depth knowledge of accessibility requirements including experience using some non-GUI browse mode.  </s>
<s> I will wait 24 hours for more comments here before I try to precipitate this activity elsewhere.  </s>
<s> -- Al  </s>
<s> Essentially, we need to decide whether RDF will provide an optimal solution, or whether it would still be preferable to pursue changes to the reserved link types in HTML.  </s>
<s> If this working group opts for RDF, as I think is likely, then the task of working out the details could be added to the list of action items for the FP working group.  </s>
<s> How far is the RDF specification from being completed and submitted as a proposed recommendation?  </s>
<s> Obviously it should be reviewed by the FP group at some stage prior to becoming a standard, and perhaps the dictionary requirements could be considered as part of such a process.  </s>

<s> - how browser recognizes that a dictionary is useful w.r.t. an HTML document without explicit mention in document.  </s>
<s> DP: Suggest we tackle this on a default then priority basis.  </s>
<s> 1. Default, left to stylesheet to determine (since the stylesheet knows the 'customer' capability -e.g.  </s>
<s> I am clever, I can deal with this through to I don't know what to do with this, help me browser.  </s>
<s> 2. Author intent.  </s>
<s> I would like the reader to use dictionary X, knowing from the content the difficulties that may arise 3. Browser does its best.  </s>
<s> - how author indicates that a dictionary is to be preferred for a specific use w.r.t. current document (, current entity).  </s>
<s> DP: As above, for the entity being dealt with, ?? using some characteristic.  </s>
<s> Indication that a dictionary is necessary for this item - how browser detects text resources associated with an image.  </s>
<s> DP: Bottom of the ladder.  </s>
<s> No one else has suggested how it might be interpreted, hence I must.  </s>
<s> This also caters for the lazy author.  </s>
<s> - how does the author community converge on a taxonomy for distinguishing different text resources associated with the same image in a widely-recognized way?  </s>
<s> DP: How about putting a scoped indirect interpretation.  </s>
<s> The author scope is that of layer one - he/she knows about major routes only.  </s>
<s> The stylesheet world uses that selection, in the knowledge of what the customer wants and has available.  </s>
<s> This keeps the author input 'simple' in terms of an n way switch, permitting the stylesheet interpretation the flexibility to grow with technology to encompass more and more 'routes' to resources.  </s>
