<s> Dear WAI-UA-WG, I would like to complement the User Agent team for a job well done.  </s>
<s> On behalf of the NISO committee developing specifications for Digital talking Books,I have been asked to pass on some comments about navigation we are involved in that you might find useful.  </s>
<s> Those of us involved with the development of Digital Talking Books (DTB) through the NISO effort in conjunction with the DAISY Consortium would like to explain some navigation and reading concepts we use.  </s>
<s> We thought this might be helpful in the final drafting of the User Agent Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Our focus has been on the conversion of printed books and their utility in a digital arena.  </s>
<s> I'm sure you will find our comments relevant to the context of using and reading books.  </s>
<s> We believe this relates to the web as well.  </s>
<s> If you see the need, Please feel free to use any of these concepts.  </s>
<s> TERMS Global Navigation - (synonym = navigation )A mechanism to get quickly to a portion of a book that you want to read.  </s>
<s> Local Navigation - (synonym = reading) The process of moving through information to understand the content.  </s>
<s> DESCRIPTIONS In the arena of DTB we developed a concept of a "Navigation Control Center" (NCC) which resembles a traditional table of contents, but it is more.  </s>
<s> The NCC contains links to all headings at all levels in the book.  </s>
<s> In addition to the headings, links to all pages are inserted.  </s>
<s> Finally we include in the NCC links to all items that the reader may select to turn off for reading.  </s>
<s> For example, if the reader has the automatic reading of footnotes turned off, there must be a way to quickly get back to that information.  </s>
<s> For this reason, the reference to the footnote is placed in the NCC and the reader can go to the reference, understand the context for the footnote, and then read the footnote.  </s>
<s> All items that have the option of turning off automatic reading can be reached through the NCC.  </s>
<s> Once a reader is at a location they wish to start reading, the navigation process changes.  </s>
<s> Of course, the reader may elect to read sequentially, but many times some navigation is needed.  </s>
<s> Going back or forward one word or character at a time is used frequently.  </s>
<s> Moving from one sentence or paragraph at a time is also needed.  </s>
<s> This type of local navigation is different from the global navigation used to get to the location of what you want to read.  </s>
<s> It is frequently desirable to move from one block element to the next.  </s>
<s> For example, moving from a paragraph to the next block element which may be a list, block quote, or sidebar is the normally expected mechanism for local navigation.  </s>
<s> We believe the way a person reads sometimes depends on the construct of the item they are reading.  </s>
<s> "Moving into" tables, or lists, or math requires different navigation options to facilitate reading.  </s>
<s> This means that the navigation options are context sensitive.  </s>
<s> HOW THIS RELATES TO THE USER AGENT GUIDELINES Navigating the web is much different than reading a specially prepared DTB.  </s>
<s> However, many of the elements are the same.  </s>
<s> The user on the web follows links to get to a place that is interesting and then starts to read that page using the local navigation techniques to understand the content of the page.  </s>
<s> The user agents must allow both global and local navigation to support reading.  </s>

<s> We have called these concepts "direct" and "contextual" access.  </s>
<s> Refer to [1]: User agents should provide access to functionalities in different ways to meet the skills and needs of different audiences: * Contextual access (e.g., through cascading menus, through help systems, etc.) helps users with cognitive impairments and any users unfamiliar with the tool.  </s>
<s> * Direct access (e.g., through keyboard or voice shortcuts) helps some users with motor limitations and speeds up use by experienced users.  </s>

<s> Hi, I'm not quite sure whether this is relevant, but I've been working with an XML project where we used a unfiy navigation approach rather than local and global.  </s>
<s> The only difference between local and global was the size of chunk in terms of navigation.  </s>
<s> We provide navigation at the sentence, paragraph and section levels.  </s>
<s> By using the same concept it simplified the programming and we were able to used object oriented technology fairly easily.  </s>
<s> In addition, the XML parser is dynamically specified so it can handle additional groupings like chapter, chapter grouping, etc. Scott  </s>
