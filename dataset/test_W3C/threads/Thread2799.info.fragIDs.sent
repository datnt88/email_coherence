<s> I suggest the following change for Content-Disposition:  </s>
<s> 19.5.1 Content-Disposition The receiving user agent SHOULD NOT respect any directory path  </s>
<s> ! information present in the filename-parm parameter.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> filename SHOULD be treated as a terminal component only.  </s>
<s> + The filename MAY be modified in a way that the system will + correctly recognize the media type given in the Content-Type + header, i.e. by adding an appropraite file extension.  </s>
<s> !  </s>
<s> disposition-type = "attachment" | "inline" | disp-extension-token + disposition-parm = filename-parm | disp-extension-parm + | creation-date-parm + | modification-date-parm + | read-date-parm + | size-parm  </s>
<s> disp-extension-parameter  </s>
<s> The new date fields of RFC 2183 could also be used in HTTP and are currently missing from HTTP.  </s>
<s> I consider the fact that modification-data-parm is independent from Last- Modified a feature: Last-Modified can be used to indicate when the resource under this URL changed (i.e. date of upload to server), while the modification-date parameter explicitly refers to the modification date of the file offered for download (i.e. the file when the archive was compiled).  </s>
<s> - If this header is used in a response with the application/octet- - stream content-type, the implied suggestion is that the user agent - should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response - as...' dialog.  </s>
<s> + The disposition "inline" suggests that the user agent should try to + display the response directly.  </s>
<s> It may fallback to "attachment" if + it is unable to display the response or display it using a generic + viewing method (such as a hex viewer).  </s>
<s> + The disposition "attachment" suggests that the user agent should not + display the response, but directly enter a `save response as...' + dialog.  </s>
<s> + If no Content-Disposition is given, UAs usually makes a guess based + on the Content-type.  </s>
<s> Rationale: It is not a good idea to use the file type to determine whether to display it inline.  </s>
<s> A UA could still start a hex viewer for application/octet-stream to display it inline in it's browser window.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if is bad if I get type "application/octet-stream" and filename "foo.gif" and don't know how to handle it, just because my system does not determine file types by extension.  </s>
<s> I believe this is what the "disposition" information is actually for.  </s>
<s> The assignments inline = display directly and attachment = save to disk mostly agree with the definitions in RFC 2183.  </s>
<s> Then, why not make it part of the official HTTP spec?  </s>
<s> If implemented correctly, it can be safe and useful.  </s>
<s> And what about Content-Description? PGP: ID=1024/527CADCD FP=12 20 49 F3 E1 04 9E 9E 25 56 69 A5 C6 A0 C9 DC  </s>
<s> This is taken from the MIME useage of Content-Disposition.  </s>
<s> We will not differ from current Web usage (without changing the name).  </s>
<s> We will not add new material to HTTP/1.1 at this late date (we have finished working group last call, and have asked the area directors to start the approval process.  </s>
<s> However, feel free (as a separate document) to propose improvements in this area.  </s>
<s> Is our description in variance with other MIME or current Web cleint usage?  </s>

<s> Jim Gettys:  </s>
<s> I initially wrote the Content-Disposition section, so let me add some details here.  </s>
<s> The Content-Disposition section documents *only* what some popular current web browsers do.  </s>
<s> I was careful not to specify anything beyond what I could test to heve been implemented.  </s>
<s> The section does not contain any actual requirements for HTTP/1.1 software.  </s>
<s> It was added to answer a frequently asked question.  </s>
<s> If we had set out to specify an improved version of Content-Disposition, something like your proposal would have been in the specification.  </s>
<s> But we did not set out to specify any improvement, reasoning that others (e.g. the MIME community) could to this if needed.  </s>
<s> That being said, *if* another revision of the 1.1 spec is necessary, it would be nice to add a pointer to RFC 2183, which updates RFC 1806.  </s>

<s> Sounds like updating the spec to reference 2183 is in order, to me.  </s>
<s> As Koen (and I) have pointed out, that non-normative section is there to document existing practice of existing browsers; anything more than this should be handled as a separate document.  </s>

<s> Content-Dispostion was implemented in Web browsers BEFORE it was added to the HTTP/1.1 spec, to document existing practice.  </s>
<s> It is indeed quite useful, when people are downloading code, to be able to provide a file name for "save as" to work.  </s>
