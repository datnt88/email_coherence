<s> Hi folks, Does anyone know where I can find matrices of which screen readers support which HTML attributes and elements that are beneficial to accessibility (e.g., abbr)?  </s>

<s> I'd like to see that one my self.  </s>
<s> I think part of it has to do with how msaa and the browsers support the elements.  </s>
<s> part for instance of the way jfw handles the title tag has to do with the current implementation of it by ie. elements/attributes?  </s>

<s> This is going to be the case for most screen readers.  </s>
<s> I can only speak for Window-Eyes, but we do not parse HTML ourselves.  </s>
<s> Instead, we receive the parsed information from the browser through MSAA.  </s>
<s> So, if the TAGs in question are supported by MSAA, then they will be supported by Window-Eyes.  </s>
<s> If we have to step around MSAA and go right to the DOM to get some feature to work, then we will.  </s>
<s> But those cases are usually rare.  </s>
