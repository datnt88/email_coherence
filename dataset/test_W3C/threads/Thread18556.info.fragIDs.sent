<s> Hello all, At the 11 April 2002 teleconference [1], I took an action regarding issue 521 [2] to identify checkpoints whose requirements apply independent of formats that are part of the conformance claim.  </s>
<s> I propose that for the following checkpoints (reference UAAG 1.0 12 Sep 2001 draft [3]), the format requirements apply as follows: 3.1 Toggle background images: Applies for all image formats.  </s>
<s> 3.2 Toggle audio, video, animated images: Applies for all audio, video, and animated image formats.  </s>
<s> 3.3 Toggle animated/blinking text: Applies to all formats.  </s>
<s> 3.7 Toggle images.  </s>
<s> Applies to all image formats.  </s>
<s> 4.9 Global volume control.  </s>
<s> Applies to all audio formats.  </s>
<s> I tried to come up with a model that would allow me to choose some checkpoints and not others, but I couldn't come up with anything satisfying.  </s>
<s> One feature of the above checkpoints is that I think it's possible to recognize images, audio, etc. by content type, independent of format details.  </s>
<s> Proposed changes to the specification: 1) Indicate at the beginning of the section on conformance that a user agent doesn't have to satisfy the checkpoints for EVERY implemented format, only those that are part of the conformance claim with the following exceptions: - If the conformance claim includes the VisualText content type label, the user agent must satisfy 3.3 for all formats.  </s>
<s> - If the conformance claim includes the Image content type label, the user agent must satisfy 3.1 and 3.7 for all image formats.  </s>
<s> - If the conformance claim includes one of the Audio, Video, or Animation content type labels, the user agent must satisfy 3.2 for all audio, video, or animation formats, respectively.  </s>
<s> - If the conformance claim includes the Audio content type label, the user agent must satisfy 4.9 for all sources of audio.  </s>
<s> 3) Update the relevant content type label defintions with the same information.  </s>
<s> Note: I thought that it might be useful to modify the checkpoints themselves to say "for all image formats" etc. Upon experimentation, I find that it makes the checkpoints unduly complicated.  </s>

<s> I have several issues with all of this:  </s>
<s> 1) It presumes that the UA has prior knowledge of all possible (including not-yet-determined) content type definitions/declarations.  </s>
<s> 2) Animated and blinking text can be created in ways that are difficult/impossible to accurately detect.  </s>

<s> Surely for a UA to render content, it must know the content-type, I agree that where you have "plug-ins" handling certain mime-types that it would cause a burden on the UA hosting the plug-in, but there it should be down the plug-in to provide the mechanisms to disable the blinking.  </s>
<s> I agree, but I don't think this need prevent the actual existence of the requirement, for example you can still provide a control which stops animated gifs and videos in the page which wouldn't stop animation introduced via css or scripting - but there are other mechanisms which can stop those aswell.  </s>
<s> Surely whilst you need to provide the mechanism it doesn't need to be within one single switch.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> JRG: If you don't recognize a content type you will not be able to render it anyway.  </s>
<s> Can IE render content that it doesn't recognize?  </s>
<s> JRG: We only require that the user agent control based on content type (animated gif) or markup known to blink (BLINK element).  </s>
<s> The user agent does not need to calculate or analyze content to see if it is blinking.  </s>
