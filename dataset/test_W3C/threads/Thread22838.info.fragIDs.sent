<s> As per the subject line: are there any WYSIWYG XML/HTML/CSS editors with a DOM based plugin API (binding language not that important, but preferably java)?  </s>
<s> If not, are there any vendors  </s>
<s> planning such a thing?  </s>

<s> I think XMetaL fits this description.  </s>
<s> It uses CSS for styling and claims to expose a DOM API to scripts (I haven't checked).  </s>
<s> However, it is highly Windows-specific in that it uses MSIE.  </s>
<s> One good thing: it uses Windows Scripting Host for scripting, which means that any WSH language can be used for scripting (or so I am told).  </s>
<s> Personally I would use Python for this and quite simply forget about the other alternatives.  </s>

<s> SoftQuad Software has both an HTML and an XML editor with close-to-WYSIWYG capabilities using CSS which have a DOM interface (not yet 100% Level 1, but we're getting there!) The DOM is reachable via COM, so you can use any scripting language that works with the Windows Scripting Host.  </s>

<s> The Emil? XML editor http://www.in-progress.com  </s>
<s> has a DOM1 based plugin API.  </s>
<s> DOM can also be used when writing scripts for the application.  </s>
<s> The next release of Emil? is likely to support DOM2 (I am working on it right this instance).  </s>
<s> The same DOM interface can also be used with our other web software, included the Interaction web server companion and XPublish XML website publishing system.  </s>
<s> All these applications are implemented in Common LISP and can be extended using scripts or compiled code in the same language.  </s>
<s> The DOM binding for Common LISP is documented at: Emil? and our other XML software are deliberately not WYSIWYG.  </s>
<s> I am a firm believer in separating content from presentation.  </s>

<s> Take advantage of XML with Emile, the first XML editor for Mac!  </s>
<s> Arbortext also has an XML editor, Epic 3.0, that has DOM Level 1 support.  </s>
<s> The editor can run as a COM server to provide Windows applications access to the DOM.  </s>
<s> As with the others it is not WYSIWYG, but is close to WYSIWYG.  </s>
