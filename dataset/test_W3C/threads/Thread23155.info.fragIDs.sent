<s> Xerces knows that any node object that was created by the document (either through a call to a document create* method or returned by a public method) will implement NodeImpl and instanceOf NodeImpl is false, it is certain that the node was not created by the document but is from another implementation.  </s>
<s> Any object that implements org.w3c.dom.Node but isn't an subclass of org.apache.xerces.NodeImpl was not created by the Document.  </s>
<s> Passing an object from a different implementation is more than just a wrong document and a different type of exception is not unexpected.  </s>
<s> The public interfaces do not attempt to interfaces that would allow you to provide your own implementation of Node.  </s>

<s> The issue is that there are behaviors required by the DOM spec that can't be implemented in terms of the public APIs.  </s>
<s> Well known to any implementor.  </s>
<s> It complicates the task of testing, too, since triggering the behaviors (creating readonly nodes, as one example) also requires behaviors out of scope of the spec.  </s>
<s> Would it be a Good Thing if the public interfaces were sufficient for such purposes -- both implementation and testing?  </s>

<s> This turns out to be a very ugly problem, and this feature has trimmed itself down and will only support nodes which are subclassed from the same DOM implementation.  </s>

<s> Whitespace is officially part of the document's content, per the XML spec.  </s>
<s> The DOM preserves it.  </s>
<s> If you filter it out of the document before building the DOM, there's nothing we can do about it.  </s>
<s> Similarly, if your serializer introduces additional whitespace, there's nothing we can do about that.  </s>
<s> Either has the potential to change the document's meaning and shoudl be done only when you _KNOW_ that the whitespace is not meaningful.  </s>

<s> It would seem to a bug in the implementation that you are using, which, unfortunately, you did not specify either the implementation or version.  </s>
<s> You might look for a different version of the parser or a parser configuration flag like ignoreWhitespace or ignoreElementContentWhitespace and set that to false in case the behavior was an overaggressive elimination of whitespace.  </s>
