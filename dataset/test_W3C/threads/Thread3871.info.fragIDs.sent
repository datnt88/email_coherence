<s> Hi Michael, Thanks for pointing out those inconsistencies.  </s>
<s> The Working Groups will discuss them and improve the situation.  </s>
<s> In the meantime send your  </s>
<s> comments to the list indicated in the relevant working draft.  </s>
<s> If you  </s>
<s> have more general comments that do not necessarily refer to a single  </s>
<s> document, send them to public-qt-comments@w3.org.  </s>
<s> The will always be people  </s>
<s> from both working groups reading it anyway and able to forward the comment  </s>
<s> to the appropriate group or subgroup.  </s>
<s> That was an error and it is now fixed.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> Yes, that's an unfortunate oversight.  </s>
<s> And that one's a typo.  </s>
<s> Sorry!  </s>
<s> Yes it does.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you were blinded by the bright green background.  </s>
<s> Two-thirds of the way down the Status section, it says: "Comments on this specification may be sent to public-qt-comments@w3.org; archives of the comments are available".  </s>

<s> Michael: The F&amp;O draft went to press before the change in the comments list was announced.  </s>
<s> We'll fix in the next release.  </s>
