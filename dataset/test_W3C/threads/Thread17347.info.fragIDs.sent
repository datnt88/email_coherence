<s> Not sure if this has been raised before but I have just been looking at the latest working draft for WCAG 2.0 and noticed a significant change between the 24 June 2003 and 27 October 2003 versions.  </s>
<s> In the former there are explicit references to a system of prioritisation for checkpoints that make it possible to 'rate' the accessibility of a site in a way that is currently possible with WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> However, in the October version these appear to have been removed.  </s>
<s> Working in local government I have a legal obligation to provide priority 2 pages as a minimum but I see no way that the latest WCAG 2 draft provides a grading system that can be see as an equivalent.  </s>
<s> I guess that those having to develop to 508 standards will have similar questions.  </s>

<s> [update] just come across and _internal_ draft document dated 01/03/1004 which contains sections dealing with the issue of conformance levels of accessibility.  </s>
<s> My guess is that the 27 October draft I quoted below is also an internal one.  </s>
<s> Maybe an indication on the actual document of what is internal and what is stable and public might be a good idea.  </s>
