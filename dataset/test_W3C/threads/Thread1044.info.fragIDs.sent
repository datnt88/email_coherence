<s> JTidy seems to not be a full implementation of Tidy.  </s>
<s> Is there a better way I can use Tidy in a jsp application.  </s>
<s> George Matthes  </s>
<s> What's missing?  </s>
<s> JTidy has - strictly speaking - not been updated since August 2000, but it's certainly usable.  </s>
<s> To call the non-stable C version command line tool does not seem to be any better, hence no, there is no better way atm.  </s>
<s> Actually, I wonder about that.  </s>
<s> First, the C version is quite stable - thanks in no small part to the many bug fixes made by the JTidy crew.  </s>
<s> Second, with the advent of TidyLib, I think it would be very easy to generate a Java JNI wrapper using SWIG.  </s>
<s> I have done a Perl wrapper that works very well, indeed.  </s>
<s> The only downside to JNI, AFAI can see, is the installation is more cumbersome.  </s>
<s> There is very little loss of portability.  </s>
<s> Just a thought, Charlie  </s>
