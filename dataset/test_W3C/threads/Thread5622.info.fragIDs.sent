<s> I was wondering when someone would start to actually understand the implications of this.  </s>
<s> You are correct in being concerned about Flash.  </s>
<s> Concerning international patents, my guess is that Eolas has filed their international patent(s), this is normal practice.  </s>
<s> Weather or not Eolas pursuies and wins battles internationally are anyone's guess.  </s>
<s> I for one have not had the chance to read through Eolas' patent yet, but as far as MS is concerned, we must all remember that not just IE is affected, but MSN Explorer as well (their current browser push).  </s>
<s> MSN Explorer utilizes IE at its core as well as the ActiveX/Plug-in architecture not only with content but the application interface as well.  </s>
<s> I am not going to even ponder the possible ramifications within the operating system, for like I stated I have not yet had the chance to review their patent.  </s>
<s> On to patents in general, I personally support the concept of patents.  </s>
<s> Eolas is a wonderful example of why patents should exist (although their current technique in enforcing them seems to have all the grace and good business practice of the 1000lb gorilla we liken MS to be).  </s>
<s> Without patents small companies/individuals have little protection for their intellectual property.  </s>
<s> NOTE: I am not looking for an extended argument concerning this; it is merely my opinion from the point of view of someone who has gone through the patent process for these reasons.  </s>
<s> Does it affect Europe?  </s>
<s> You bet, possible not directly, but indirectly without a doubt.  </s>
<s> Most of your software comes from the US. Legality and infringement within the US will surely affect your specific utilization, Aral.  </s>

<s> Aral,  </s>
<s> As a Flash programmer, I certainly share your concerns.  </s>
<s> I am curious where precisely the line is drawn on the 'plugin' issue.  </s>
<s> Are browser plugins themselves an infringement of the patent, or is the scope of the patent limited to the process of using embedded objects in 'hypermedia' documents to control browser plugins?  </s>
<s> Will it be possible to skirt the issue by linking directly to .SWF docs?  </s>
<s> How will this effect traditional client-side applications that support OLE embedded objects, i.e. most of Microsoft Office?  </s>
<s> Perhaps the most distressing of all eOLAS' claims (that I have yet to see addressed), is the "invention" of remote computing - basically any program running on a networked computer being controlled by another computer on the network.  </s>
<s> This could have a devastating effect on distributed/web-based computing.  </s>
<s> Also, eOLAS holds a patent on the use of images/colors/pixels to access or navigate information and claims "The patent also covers image space collision detection technology believed to be currently in widespread use throughout the computer game industry."  </s>
<s> I guess the question is who they will sue next?  </s>

<s> This is exactly why we need more software coming out of Europe (and why Open Source and decentralized development are such great ideas.)  </s>

<s> Hi, Being a Shockwave developer (with Macromedia Director) I'm as worried as you, but I'm also curious about what this will do for the open source community.  </s>
<s> I'd be happy to switch to Linux if the apps I need to work existed in Linux, like Macromedia products, Adobe Photoshop, 3DS MAX...  </s>
<s> On the other hand, since MS most likely will appeal the verdict, I guess this process will take years before it gets anywhere.  </s>

<s> Hi Craig, I don't think that it is a coincidence that Macromedia launched the Central project when it did.  </s>
<s> Central replaces the browser.  </s>
<s> However, how this will affect the ubiquity of Flash is anyone's guess.  </s>
<s> Even if it is, it will require changes to the current system (the SWF would probably have to play in the external player -- unless they patented launching an app via a hyperlink on a page too.) It will also mean that pages that use a combination of Flash and HTML will not be feasible.  </s>
<s> Part of the allure of Flash (and one of the reasons why we have such restrictive sandbox security in Flash) is to be able to run a SWF without asking the user.  </s>
<s> I guess that the platform independence of the SWF will play to its favor even if it is launched from a link but the experience on the whole won't be much different from downloading an application and running it.  </s>

<s> Patents are a _bad_ idea especially for small business that don't have a patent portfolio.  </s>
<s> Small business never stand a chance against big companies with a large set of patents (even if they do have a patent).  </s>
<s> The only reason I can think of that Eolas won this lawsuit is because they don't have any applications and therefor or not infringing on any patents.  </s>
<s> Otherwise Microsoft would have countersued them.  </s>
<s> So where you basicly want to have a free market, software patents allow some clever guy to create a monopoly on something as basic as a progress bar and collects the money.  </s>
<s> None of my software comes from the US.  </s>
<s> There may be contributions from the US, but since I'm only running Open Source software you can't say that I'm using US software.  </s>
<s> So it may affect US contributions to Open Source software in the future (just like the DMCA probably had an affect on that).  </s>
<s> But as long as the US doesn't succeed in enforcing software patents on Europe, we can use plugins and progress bars and one click shopping scripts as much as we want.  </s>
<s> So if software patents mean that in the long run US citizens can't run any Open Source software, I'm sure US will reconsider its point of view.  </s>
<s> If however they succeed in forcing the whole world to adopt software patents, sure they will have a huge advantage (all those basic patents that I consider common sense ideas).  </s>
<s> If Europe thinks twice, I'm sure they understand what's at stake here.  </s>

<s> Another reason why software patents are no advantage for small companies.  </s>
<s> Even if they have a software patent, they cannot stand years of litigation.  </s>
<s> If you plan to spend effort in rewriting a website, rewriting functionality in applications (because of this patent) or even discussing it, you're time is worth more if you can effectively fight against software patents.  </s>

<s> As a former Flash user, I understand your concerns.  </s>
<s> However, the case of Flash seems less pressing to me.  </s>
<s> Flash is a neat authoring tool, that has the ability to save to several formats (primarily SWF as of now, but also for instance Quicktime).  </s>
<s> Due to its curent dominant use of SWF, it is threatened by the plugin issue.  </s>
<s> However, the authoring tool and its primary output format are not coupled together, and switching its output to, say, SVG would allow developers to embed their animations and applications directly within the pages they serve, thus nullifying the plugin issue.  </s>
<s> Supporting both while end-users upgrade would probably not be a problem.  </s>
<s> It would be a slightly bold move, but better that than see Macromedia lock themselves up in their own proprietary format!  </s>
