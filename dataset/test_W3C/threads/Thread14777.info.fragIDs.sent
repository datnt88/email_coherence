<s> Has anyone seen an example of the following: a static link that is the place-holder for a current picture?  </s>
<s> for example this could be a picture of the singer from the current No1 single, where the link name and address is static from week to week, or  </s>
<s> a news site where the image changes from day to day, but the link is static.  </s>
<s> Rationale: we have a lot of work updating our links, which could possibly be avoided.  </s>
<s> thanks jonathan chetwynd peepo project manager  </s>
<s> This is one place where PNG would be very nice - since it has the ability to embed text in the image file, thus having the text travel around with the graphic.  </s>
<s> A tool could pull the text out -- or future access technologies could.  </s>

<s> Doing this with a server is also possible.  </s>
<s> Apache does it - there is a file called .htaccess which can temporarily or permanently redirect what you ask for (the URI of the current thing) to the particular instance (the URI that a particular image lives at permanently).  </s>
