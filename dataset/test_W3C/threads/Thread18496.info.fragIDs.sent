<s> Re: [The User Agent Accessibiity Guidelines group at W3C are presently discussing whether there needs to be a way of highlighting that a particular image is an imagemap.]  </s>
<s> I'm sure it helps if images that are hot are marked.  </s>
<s> I don't like having to drive the mouse over sundry bits of graphical eye candy to see which ones are links (eg by watching the status line).  </s>
<s> And I'm sure someone less dexterous with a mouse finds it even more inconvenient.  </s>
<s> Touchscreens are even less revealing as there is really no "mouse over event".  </s>
<s> A good image map eg used as a menu, probably can convey its role and segmentation by graphic design.  </s>
<s> The marking as follows using the "title" parameter works well enough with MSIE (haven't checked with other browsers) although the alt content only shows if images are turned off or are missing.  </s>
<s> img src="elr3_mo.gif"  </s>
<s> width="200" height="100" alt="The image" usemap="#themap" title="Image map"/ Best regards, Rob Seiler ... Web: http://www.elr.com.au ... e-mail: seiler@elr.com.au  </s>
<s> Do you consider this a usability issue (something that makes it easier for people) or an disability access issue (without this feature people with disabilities would not have access to the content)?  </s>

<s> Rob and Toni, For elements that receive focus, we have additional checkpoints for styling that include changing border styling.  </s>

<s> Hi Jon Probably mainly usability, but image maps really can become a disability issue if, for example, a user requires to tab through links, and can't see the frequently very fine "dotted lines" that may indicate the cursor location.  </s>
