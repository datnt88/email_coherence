<s> Hi Hugh and Daniel, When we deliver the standard Amaya source tarfile, some libwww files are available: *.h, configure.  </s>
<s> The libwww community doesn't agree with that approach.  </s>
<s> They prefer to deliver *.html files and generate *.h from *.html files with a script perl.  </s>
<s> So files libwww/Library/src/*.h are not available in the CVS base.  </s>
<s> Daniel, could you update the tar script and replace libwww/Library/src/*.h by libwww/Library/src/*.html.  </s>
<s> For people who are downloading the snapshot they should process differently than for the standard source distribution.  </s>
<s> They have first to generate include files and the file configure as explained in the section "Getting libwww Boostrapped" of http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html In-reply-to: Your message of Fri, 17 Mar 2000 14:42:35 +0000."  </s>

<s> Done, I also increased the frequency of the tar generation to 4 time a day.  </s>
