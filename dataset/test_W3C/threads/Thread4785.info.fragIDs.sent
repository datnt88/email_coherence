<s> (All that said, I'm still not comfortable supporting even my reworded requirement without a real definition for "subgraph".)  </s>
<s> Rob, When I have been using the term I mean a subset of the edges of the RDF graph.  </s>
<s> As RDF Graphs are restricted in what they can be (not the complete defintion in a graph theory book), the subgraph = subset of edges is similarly restricted.  </s>
<s> I personally don't imply "connected" in the term "subgraph" but I know this does arise in discussions elsewhere.  </s>
<s> The other thing is that what matters is not "being a subgraph of" but being "isomorphic to a subgraph of" because of bNodes but the language gets a little heavy to say that everytime.  </s>
<s> Googling ... getting sidetracked ... DMP - Discrete Mathematics Project === (fixing the typo) Subgraph A subgraph of a graph is itself a graph in which all of the edges and vertices are contained within the original graph.  </s>
<s> As RDF does not allow nodes (vertices) without edges (triples, statements), this seems to say that the usage is the same here.  </s>
<s> === """A connected subset of a graph."""  </s>
<s> And then goes on to talk about graphs for sensemaking.  </s>
<s> More inline.  </s>
<s> Andy  </s>
<s> Is this touching on the fact that it is only useful to worry isomorphism and not equality?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that "structure" is important so that subgraphs can be passed on to other systems.  </s>
<s> Some of this goes back to: And also descirptions like t"graphs with holes" meaning named variables for slots in the triples.  </s>
<s> Talking about "a subgraph" is better.  </s>
<s> I won't want to imply the necessity to find "the subgraph" for some virtual triples cases, like when that's infinite.  </s>
<s> In a query on an RDF graph (just the RDF graph), there is one particular subgraph of interest - the one that the query triple patterns match.  </s>
<s> Its the same as (isomorphic to) the merge of each of the matching subgraphs.  </s>
<s> Moving to virtual triples is not trivial and there are choices, based on, amongst other things, whether the predicates/classes in the query are returned or the ones on the graph, and this is only at the RDFS level.  </s>
<s> The intention is returning the information the query needed to match - we have to find a away to express that but maybe not in the requiremtn and leave it for further work in the WG.  </s>
<s> And what's the difference between "quried graph" and "original quried graph?"  </s>
<s> If no differece, why we use the latter in 3.4?  </s>

<s> Yes. Here's a summary of the RDF terminology from and URIrefs, literals and blank nodes are mutually disjoint; in other words, whatever blank nodes are, they aren't urirefs or literals.  </s>
<s> A triple is a 3-tuple of the form (uriref or blank node) + uriref + (uriref or blank node or literal) An RDF graph is a set of triples.  </s>
<s> (It is not a graph in the sense used in graph theory.  </s>
<s> I once checked it out and I think it is technically a labelled multi-pseudo-digraph with a unique node labelling.  </s>
<s> Or something close to that, anyway.  </s>
<s> Whatever.) (So why did we call them 'graphs'?  </s>
<s> Because they look like that when you draw a picture, OK ?? Why do you ask so many questions??? ) Subgraph means subset of a set of triples.  </s>
<s> (The terms 'edge', 'label' and 'vertex' are not used.  </s>
<s> 'Path' could be defined but doesn't seem to be a useful notion.)  </s>
<s> An instance of a graph is any graph obtained from it by substituting urirefs, blank nodes or literals for blank nodes in a systematic way.  </s>
<s> If the substitution replaces blank nodes by blank nodes in a 1:1 fashion, so the substitution is invertible and the instance is also a generalization, then the graph and the instance are equivalent, i.e. isomorphic, cf.  </s>
<s> Equivalent graphs are often treated as the same graph (using what in mathematics is called a 'familiar abuse of terminology'.) Generalization is the inverse of instance.  </s>
<s> Merging is taking a union of two graphs after replacing one of them by an equivalent graph so as to avoid any accidental collisions of blank nodes.  </s>
<s> There is a result about basic RDF inference: A graph G implies another graph H just when H is a generalization of a subgraph of G. (Strictly speaking, RDF inference also requires that literals typed with rdf:XMLLiteral are appropriately recognized and that urirefs used as properties are of the right rdf:type: see details.) Hope this is some help.  </s>
