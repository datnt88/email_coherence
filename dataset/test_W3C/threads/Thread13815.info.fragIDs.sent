<s> As (most of) you know, AccessValet 1.0 generates diagnostic messages to help a web content developer identify and fix violations of WCAG or Section508.  </s>
<s> AccessValet 1.1 extends the capabilities of 1.0 by taking the operator through a process of classifying each warning: is this in fact a violation, and if so what to do about it.  </s>
<s> The purpose of this is to generate a briefer accessibility report that can form part of a management or QA process.  </s>
<s> EARL is of course a primary target format.  </s>
<s> I've been messing around with how to express this in EARL, and I'd like to ask for review on my current ideas.  </s>
<s> I've taken a brief Valet report, and added comments to the EARL to make it clear what's going on (chaals - does this use of "heuristic" meet your approval?) I still don't think I understand the significance of reification here:-( rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#" !-- Level1 is the automatic analysis.  </s>
<s> Detailed level1 reports are as seen in the online AccessValet -- testmode rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#automatic"/ !-- Level2 results are generated as the operator ticks off each warning in the Level 1, and marks how to treat it.  </s>
<s> The l2 assertor asserts a result based on the sum total of assertions.  </s>

<s> One level 1 assertion (result).  </s>
<s> It should perhaps also reference a detailed Level1 report; OTOH that's for the developer, and (s)he may not want to publish or even save it Result here is always "suspectagainst", quantified by the note.  </s>

<s> Any number of assertions may be made by the operator based on the warnings in the Level 1 report -- testResult rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#Pass"/ testResult rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#Fail"/ Nick Kew  </s>
<s> This seems to make sense, except that I don't think you need to have two levels.  </s>
<s> The assertor is either the tool or the person - the fact that a tool  </s>
<s> chooses to trust a person over itself means that it should suppress its own result, or that it should provide both results allowing someone else to decide the tool is smarter than the person.  </s>
<s> The significance of reification is that it lets us say "joe says that" and "fred says that" without running into a problem because the things they say are contradictory (which is what would normally happen if we merged the two statements as bare RDF).  </s>
<s> On the other hand the new schema uses some nicer property names to make the reification less visible and make it more obvious what is going on - the tested, result, etc properties are less general than subject,predicate,object, but I think that is an advantage.  </s>

<s> Since my original post, I've put up some real examples of this on the web.  </s>
<s> If you haven't already done so, can I suggest you look at the HTML version (e.g. URL:http://valet.webthing.com/access/example-full.html ; there's also a corresponding .rdf)  </s>
<s> I thinks this makes the motivation of the report very clear.  </s>
<s> Level 1 is the automatic analysis Valet has done in the past, while Level 2 is new, but has to be based on a Level 1 report (or it becomes just another checklist-with-a-GUI tool).  </s>
<s> The EARL I posted was for Level 2, but I didn't want to lose the one-line summary from the Level 1 report completely.  </s>
<s> But the tool is now doing two different things, one automatic and one heuristic, quite apart from recording the person's assertions.  </s>
<s> What bothers me is when I find use of rdf:[subject|object|predicate] seems to be an only alternative to jumping through hoops.  </s>
<s> In this case I was drafting something with pure-ish EARL terminology, but found it much simpler to express when I went back to rdf-land.  </s>
<s> Yes, that's how I think it should be, and that's why it's bothering me that it didn't work like that in this case.  </s>
