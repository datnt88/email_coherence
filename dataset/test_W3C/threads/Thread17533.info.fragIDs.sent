<s> Simple question for the benefit of screen reader users and keyboard-navigators:  </s>
<s> Can I provide a link from one frame into another that doesn't involve re-loading the second frame?  </s>
<s> I'm providing a "jump to content" link at the start of the page, only the content happens to be in another frame.  </s>
<s> (I know frames are bad; it happens to be unavoidable on this one particular page.) At the moment my best idea is to put the anchor (the target of the a href="#content" link) at the *end* of the first frame.  </s>
<s> I expect the screen reader to then announce the start of the next frame, titled "Content".  </s>
<s> That sounds OK.  </s>
<s> But then, what do I do to let the user return to the navigation in the previous frame?  </s>

<s> You could probably use JavaScript.  </s>
<s> I haven't used frames in a few years so the syntax may be off, but it would be something like this: onclick="return !(top['frameName'].document.getElementById('anchorId').focus());"  </s>
<s> Leave the regular target and href value that you already have in the link.  </s>
<s> If the JavaScript doesn't work (or is disabled or unavailable), it will return true and the regular HTML link will work.  </s>
<s> If JavaScript is on, it will focus the right spot without reloading the frame.  </s>
<s> Note: The source files of both frames should be on the same web server or you may get a security warning.  </s>
<s> Good luck, James Craig  </s>
<s> Actually, lots of things about frames are good - unfortunately there are a few architectural problems with them.  </s>
<s> In this case I would rely on the users.  </s>
<s> In common setups like IE/Jaws the users will be able to move between frames as a function of the user agent.  </s>
<s> In systems that don't present all the frames (Lynx, Amaya, etc) the user will be offered a choice of which frame they want to see (so they can choose the navigation frame, or the content frame, or whatever), or they can just work with the noframes version.  </s>

<s> Dont forget to label the frames as Chaals eluded to such as navigation, content etc. so that the screen reader user can tell what is in a particular frame.  </s>
