<s> following up on an action item at todays UI guidelines telecon, i reviewed the following issue (symm copied for archival purposes, please include it in possible reponses):  </s>
<s> #3. SMIL needs to be extended to be able to handle audio descriptions of video images (see sample of suggested code below) -- Agreed, and the method you propose looks good to me, although I would want to be sure that it is a solution that is easy to implement.  </s>
<s> Could other people please review and comment on this - Philipp, George, Geoff?  </s>
<s> ...I also think that we need a mechanism for text descriptions of video images, which my original draft didn't deal with adequately.  </s>
<s> 3. User should be able to identify and turn on and off audio descriptions of video objects.  </s>
<s> [Priority one] - Rationale: Users who cannot see a video media object need a non-visual way to identify that an audio description is available.  </s>
<s> - Technique: Provide a standard mechanism for notifying third party assistive technologies (e.g. screen-reading software) of the existence of an audio description for a video object.  </s>
<s> Provide a mechanism (which can function non-visually) for turning on or off the audio  </s>
<s> i agree with llyod's analysis that letting the user switch audio descriptions of video on and off requires introducing a new test attribute  </s>
<s> (see for lloyd's comments) the method he proposes in this message looks good and implementable to me (the proposal is to introduce "system-audio-desc" as a new test attribute via a namespace as an intermediate solution, and considering it for inclusion in a future version of SMIL) SYMM folks: for an example of what descriptive video is, have a look at geoff freed's G2 demos:  </s>
<s> With the current SMIL standard would the author need to create two versions  </s>
<s> of their document, one with captions and the other without; or would the captioning be an add on to the original document so the user just turns it  </s>
<s> on or off?  </s>

<s> assuming that you talk about text captions here: one version is enough the following example from the SMIL REC shows how this works, see In the following example, captions are shown only if the user wants captions on.  </s>
<s> The second textstream object is only shown if the "system-captions" test attribute evaluates to "true", which is the case when the user has requested captioning Lloyd proposed a similar test attribute to switch audio descriptions on and off (see my previous message)  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Philipp Hoschka said:  </s>
<s> Philipp, can you bring me up to date?  </s>
<s> At one time we talked loosely about a possible user capability to add/delete streams to/from the playlist.  </s>
<s> Additions could be made from resources whose test variable conditions failed or spare resources from SWITCH collections.  </s>
<s> Has the group considered this as a browser/player function?  </s>
<s> Is this: required functionality for any SMIL player from the SMIL spec?  </s>
<s> or a compatible extension of functionality?  </s>
<s> or a violation, an incompatible extension of functionality?  </s>
<s> Given that we don't have a standard test variable for this, the player should perhaps give the user the capability to turn on the track even if the player and the author haven't got together on the name for the appropriate test condition.  </s>
<s> I think there is already language in the SMIL spec such that the ensemble should contain an explanation of what each resource is good for, suitable for guiding the user in editing the playlist.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Regardless of what the current standard is, it ought to be a feature of a single document that can be turned on and off.  </s>
<s> If the standard makes it difficult to do the task right, most developers will take the easy route,and decide that captioning isn't *that* important.  </s>
<s> Denis  </s>
<s> Actually I think the two document (one with the original video and sound, and the second with the synchonized captioning information) format is probably better, since it can be added later for an uncaptioned video and it allows the captioning presentation to be controlled by the user through the user agent.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Jon Gunderson said:  </s>
<s> It depends on what you consider a document.  </s>
<s> A SMIL document is a folder of resources with one glue piece.  </s>
<s> Some of the resources are web address for RTSP streams.  </s>
<s> And the glue piece is in an open text format.  </s>
<s> So if the top level integrating piece of the document is a SMIL file, there is no real conflict between making it one document and adding more augmentative tracks later.  </s>
<s> [Is this point more of an GL issue, perhaps?]  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> The document format is a gl issue, but I think we want clear understanding of the preferred document format if we want SMIL players to be able to reposition and control formatting of captioning information.  </s>
<s> I assume the author could hard code the captioning information into the video stream, which would not allow it to be repositioned or reformatted.  </s>
<s> Is this true?  </s>
<s> Or do I not understand the SMIL format?  </s>
