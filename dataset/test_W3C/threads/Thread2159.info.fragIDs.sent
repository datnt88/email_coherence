<s> I mentioned this before, obliquely in a response on another topic, but if I'm right, what follows can significantly reduce the potential performance problems with DMK's State-Info proposal.  </s>
<s> In the current version of the proposal (Dave, maybe you should increment your file number when you change the contents) DMK states that caching proxies "must pass along a State-Info request header from the requesting client to the next server, even if it has cached the requested resource locally."  </s>
<s> At first this seemed right, and in fact I made some arguments about the potential performance impact.  </s>
<s> But somebody please tell me what is wrong with the following reasoning: if a resource is in a cache, it should only be there because it is possible to "legally" fetch the resource from the cache without contacting the origin server.  </s>
<s> If this were not the case, the document should not be cached.  </s>
<s> Any IDEMPOTENT  </s>
<s> method by definition has no side effects at the origin server.  </s>
<s> Only idempotent requests can be served from caches.  </s>
<s> Any non-idempotent method is not allowed to retrieve a cached copy of a resource -- it must make a request to the origin server.  </s>
<s> Key conclusion: An idempotent request such as GET, which produces no side effects, cannot affect the state of a stateful dialog.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it seems unnecessary for requests that can be satisfied out of a cache to pass through any information to the next server.  </s>
<s> This, of course, makes it even more imperative that caches not serve cached documents they shouldn't.  </s>
<s> With the recent addition to the proposal that clients stay in the "have state-info" state when there is no state-info in the server's (or cache's) response, this means that caches need not "reflect" state-info either.  </s>
<s> --Shel Kaphan  </s>
<s> This idea sounds promising.  </s>
<s> Let me expand a bit from an operational standpoint.  </s>
<s> Remember the recent change whereby a user agent retains its State-Info if it receives no State-Info from a server.  </s>
<s> If caching proxies followed the rule that they cached only those documents for which they received no State-Info from the origin server, and if origin servers were careful to send State-Info only when it changed, I believe caching proxies would be able to cache anything cachable (in the State-Info context).  </s>
<s> Upon getting a one, a caching proxy could satisfy a request for a resource from the cache if there were a fresh one available, whether or not the request contained a State-Info request header.  </s>
<s> (That's a change, and it would indeed enhance caching.) The idea of an idempotent method could be expanded to imply that, not only does the resource not change, but its State-Info does not change either.  </s>
<s> (I guess that's obvious if you bundle State-Info into a larger concept of "the resource".)  </s>
<s> Nice idea!  </s>
<s> If the dust settles without major objections, I'll add this to a state-info-01 I-D.  </s>
<s> That will be a couple of weeks, after some vacation.  </s>

<s> Dave Kristol: [dropping the requirement that proxy caches must always forward state-info headers from clients]  </s>
<s> Dropping the state-info forwarding requirement would make your state-info-01 almost identical to the planned second version of my non-persistent cookie proposal.  </s>
<s> I guess this means that I don't have to write my second version anymore.  </s>
<s> Let me try to summarize the state-info/caching requirements we seem to have converged at, in the form of modifications to draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt.  </s>
<s> Dave, feel free to cut and paste from the text below if you can use it.  </s>
<s> [Note to Daniel W. Connolly, added later: I just realized that a lot of the material in Section 4.3 below could go straight into a "HTTP Caching: rules and Heuristics" document.  </s>
<s> Feel free to cut and paste.]  </s>
<s> ----------snip---------- 1. ABSTRACT [Delete the discussion of library browsing, this is no longer directly supported if state-info is not always passed though.  </s>
<s> (However, there are still ways to implement library browsing, see 5.3 below)] 4. PROPOSAL OUTLINE 4.1 Origin Server Role An origin server may only include State-Info headers in responses to non-idempotent requests.  </s>
<s> (Non-idempotent requests are all request that do not use the GET and HEAD methods) 4.2 User Agent Role For reasons of privacy protection (see Section 6), a user agent should ignore State-Info headers contained in responses to idempotent (GET and HEAD) requests.  </s>
<s> A user agent in the state ``have state-info'' should include a State-info request header in all requests to the origin server, whether these are idempotent or not.  </s>
<s> Caches in user agents should be careful to implement the caching semantics defined in the HTTP protocol, especially when handling requests or responses containing State-Info headers.  </s>
<s> If the user agent allows the user to configure the its cache to `check the for validity of document (i.e. issue conditional get if expired) only once per session', this configuration option (which makes the user agent violate the HTTP specification anyway) should not override HTTP cache semantics for transactions where requests or responses containing State-Info headers are involved, as this will make stateful dialogs impossible or, worse, dangerously unreliable.  </s>
<s> 4.3 Caching Proxy Role Caches that conform completely to the (draft) HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 specification need not be changed to support State-Info.  </s>
<s> As per the requirements in the HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 drafts, caching proxies + must never cache responses to non-idempotent requests (note that the drafts probably need to make this requirement more explicit) + must not cache a response to an idempotent request if the response contains a Pragma or Expires header with a value that disallows caching Thus, origin servers can expect that proxies forward to them: - all non-idempotent requests (which may be carrying State-Info headers) issued by user agents - all idempotent requests (which may be carrying State-Info headers) for every `dynamic' URI D issued by user agents.  </s>
<s> An URI D is `dynamic' if the server has consistently put Pragma or Expires headers disallowing caching in every response message to non-idempotent requests for URI D. Proxies may `downgrade' normal GET requests to conditional GET request when doing the forwarding.  </s>
<s> An example of a `dynamic', idempotent URI is a `shopping basket contents URI' will typically be accessed with the GET method: the link to the shopping basket page will be a normal HTML A HREF=... link, it need not be a form submit button.  </s>
<s> Origin servers can only change the session state (State-Info value stored by a user agent) in response to non-idempotent request done by user agents.  </s>
<s> However, session-state is not identical to server state (the mapping URI- entity is part of the server state).  </s>
<s> Proxy and user agent (cache) authors should be aware that server may *at any time* change the entity bound to any `dynamic' URI.  </s>
<s> (An example would be a `chat page' under a dynamic URI that changes because another user writes on it, or a `stock quotes' page that is dynamically updated.) Proxy caches that, for whatever reason, are unwilling or unable *not* to cache a `dynamic' entity belonging to an URI D should, if State-Info headers were present in the request or response for D, return a HTTP error code 501 (Not Implemented) to the requesting client.  </s>
<s> [Note: Below, I distinguish between not conforming to the HTTP spec, which is bad, and breaching internet etiquette, which is much worse.  </s>
<s> For example, a user agent that sends out a badly constructed User-Agent: header may not conform to the HTTP spec, but does not commit a grave breach of internet etiquette.]  </s>
<s> Serving an outdated (incorrectly cached) dynamic response instead of giving an error code is completely unacceptable behavior, because it may break the synchronization between the session state maintained by the server and the user's view of that state.  </s>
<s> Willingly breaking this synchronization should be considered as grave a breach of internet etiquette, as bad as willingly changing the contents of relayed IP packets belonging to a telnet session.  </s>
<s> 5. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS 5.3 Browsing History Tracking The state-info facilities only allow origin servers to track user access to non-idempotent and `dynamic' idempotent URI's.  </s>
<s> A `library' or `magazine browsing' server may want to track all URI's accessed by the user, allowing it to show a list of articles looked at already.  </s>
<s> This tracking could be accomplished by making all pages `dynamic', or by including a small `dynamic' inline picture on every page.  </s>
<s> However, if neither the user agent nor any proxy close to the user agent has conditional GET capability, this technique may cause an unacceptably large amount of web traffic to be generated.  </s>
<s> 6. PRIVACY The requirement on user agents to ignore all State-Info headers contained in responses to idempotent requests (GET, HEAD) helps to protect the privacy of the user.  </s>
<s> A service provider wanting to abuse the State-Info facilities to track the path of each user through the server first has to get the user to click a form submit button or issue another browsing command resulting in the sending of a non-idempotent request.  </s>
<s> Thus, a user that does only `regular' browsing by clicking HTML A HREF links (or having the user agent resolve inline pictures or idempotent request redirections) never has to worry about getting `tagged' by a malicious service providers, even if the user has set the user agent to always engage in a stateful session without prior notice.  </s>
<s> [Note: the following addition addresses the privacy problems I discussed in my previous message in this thread.  </s>
<s> The non-idempotent requests rule discussed above makes solving these problems relatively straightforward.]  </s>
<s> + It is recommended that a user agent should, as a configuration option, be able to pop up a dialog box when receiving a State-Info response header, like this: Start a session with server foo.bar?  </s>
<s> [ Yes ] [ Yes, always ] [ No ] (Help information: Starting a session will allow foo.bar to gather accurate statistics of your actions) If one of the `yes' buttons is pressed, the user agent should change to the ``have state-info'' state.  </s>
<s> The `Yes, always' button will have the additional effect of having the user agent start a session with foo.bar without popping up a dialog box on future invocations.  </s>
<s> [`no' alternative 1:] If the `No' button is pressed, the user agent should stay in the ``no state-info'' state.  </s>
<s> When getting a new State-Info response header from foo.bar, the user agent should pop up the dialog box again.  </s>
<s> This allows users to reconsider the earlier `No' decision.  </s>
<s> [`no' alternative 2:] If the `No' button is pressed, the user agent should also go to the ``have state-info'' state, but start sending State-info request headers containing empty strings instead of sending headers with the opaque information received in the response header.  </s>
<s> When getting a new State-Info response header from foo.bar, the user agent should pop up the dialog box again.  </s>
<s> This `No' behavior allows servers to suppress the sending of more State-Info response headers and start a non-stateful dialog with users that do not want to engage in stateful dialogs for privacy reasons.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if a server receives an empty-string state-info header, it can also choose to just send a new state-info response header again, thereby asking the user to reconsider the earlier `No' decision.  </s>
