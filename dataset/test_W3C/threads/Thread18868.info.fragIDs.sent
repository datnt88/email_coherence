<s> There is a need for diversity in rhetoric.  </s>
<s> I hope that's not to psychobabble for you.  </s>
<s> The most direct way ordinary Joes can achieve a diversity in rhetoric is to "both show and tell" and pictures or diagrams are what often makes the most sense for 'show.' My beef is with the obsession with checkpoints.  </s>
<s> The appropriate response in terms of providing diversity in rhetoric is not readily captured in the "checkpoint" medium.  </s>
<s> So we need to generalize our notion of our product, or we are doing an unjust disservice to the people with cognitive disabilities whose needs are most readily addressed through the author-comprehensible devices of rhetorical diversity.  </s>
<s> Pictures are no the policy issue.  </s>
<s> Apropriate techniques to redress cognitive disability-linked inaccessibility vs. checkpoint religion is the policy issue.  </s>
<s> Sound files can help a lot.  </s>
<s> If the content is a poem, a sound file is more appropriate than a picture, probably.  </s>
<s> Alternatives to text are part of the agenda, and not completely solved by using graphics, just as diversity of content is not completely helped by text.  </s>

We got a directive from our new superintendent to limit any "human" need to know what is happening on our part, and limit the exposure of our students to graphical images of the horror .... to limit the trauma that are happening to the children who saw their parents killed from the windows of their classrooms ..... images are what brought Americans together this week .... with words and text, but mostly images ..... think about it!  </s>
