<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I also am thinking that a number of comments of this kind arise because the formal semantics is very much not the whole story, and the RDFcore work is not the end of formal semantics in RDF.  </s>
<s> When reading some comments about Bags, etc, I got the feeling that we really do want to designate some vocabulary now with a clear informally-specified meaning so that people can use it.  </s>
<s> At some point in the future, semantic extensions may formalize those meanings.  </s>
<s> RDF is part of an evolving framework, not an end in itself.  </s>
<s> I happen to believe that the RDF core represents an important staging point of limited functionality: it may be seriously incomplete as an agent or ontology language, but for many of the applications that motivated RDF (e.g. PICS), and others developed since (e.g. Dublin Core, CC/PP, Brian's P3P work, Patrick's OpenBook(?), etc.) I think it represents a very useful trade-off of functionality and complexity that meets some present requirements.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I think the lack of formalizations for some aspects of RDF "meaning" is not an indication that RDF is seriously deficient.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> It's also worthwhile noting that a number of existing applications are happily using these "underspecified" bits of vocabulary, such as containers, based on their informal meanings, to do useful work.  </s>
<s> We have at least one app in-house that is happily using reification in the same way.  </s>
<s> Without meaning to diminish the importance of formal semantics for things, people do manage to successfully communicate meanings in English sometimes (and incorporate it into their software).  </s>
