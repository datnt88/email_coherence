<s> Eager to try out the Annotea, I fired up my new Amaya and cruised over to w3.org.  </s>
<s> Not a happy experience.  </s>
<s> I noted in passing that the "menu buttons" at the top of the entry page have ugly separations between them using Amaya that aren't there  </s>
<s> using Mozilla (0.9).  </s>
<s> Also, the first clue that input ..  was going to be a problem was the rather strange look about the SEARCH on that page.  </s>
<s> Moz.  </s>
<s> renders it as a small input with the button to the right; Amaya renders a big input space with the search button kind of awkwardly at the lower left of the input.  </s>
<s> That wasn't enough warning, so I went to register with the database.  </s>
<s> The problem was so much more severe there that I was totally unable to complete the form successfully.  </s>
<s> I gave up and came back to it with Moz. to finish the job.  </s>
<s> Then I went in with Amaya and left an annotation on the database input page to the effect of what I'm writing here.  </s>
<s> Annotations are cool, indeed.  </s>
<s> But form layout has been around a long time now.  </s>
<s> Is there something that makes it difficult to do right?  </s>
<s> But I didn't just post to grinch about Amaya!  </s>
<s> This reminded me of a real need -- a whole forest of pages, preferably under w3 control containing  </s>
<s> very carefully crafted, canonically correct HTML of whatever version where we know precisely how it is intended to be rendered; say one page for each  </s>
<s> characteristic to be exercised.  </s>
<s> Thus, voila!  </s>
<s> a way to compare browsers where the page content isn't also a variable.  </s>
<s> Comment?  </s>

<s> [DJW:] HTML is not intended to have one true rendering.  </s>
<s> Even CSS up to CSS2, at least, is intended only to be treated as hints on presentation, but HTML is about document semantics and has very little to do with presentation/GUI rendering.  </s>
<s> In the area of input controls, up to at least CSS2, then  </s>
<s> expectation is that the controls will be displayed in the natural form for the operating system, not in any standard  </s>
<s> format.  </s>
<s> If you look at the PDF version of the HTML specification, it was generated from the HTML and is a valid graphical rendering, including the collapsible outline tree; however, it is unlikely to look exactly like the rendering in IE or Mozilla.  </s>
<s> If you want controlled prsentation, use PDF, whose design aim was that.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately most "HTML" authors are working on tne false premise that it is some form of page description language.  </s>

<s> This was due to a combination of selectors not supported in Amaya.  </s>
<s> It's fixed now (check on the CVS base.  </s>
<s> That depends on the font sizes and the width of the window.  </s>
<s> As you know one of the goal of HTML is to adapt the rendering to the current environment.  </s>
<s> If you used to fill a form by using TAB and ENTER, it didn't work with the current released version of Amaya.  </s>
<s> Fortunately it works with the CVS version.  </s>
<s> As I see you discovered what Amaya doesn't do that Mozilla does but not yet the opposite.  </s>
<s> A lack of manpower and a lot of things to do.  </s>
<s> is a test suite for html4 that david cobb may be interested in.  </s>
<s> There are many issues clearly defined in the recommendation that would make Amaya look more closely like other forms if rendered as the recommendation says.  </s>
<s> The most important one is SIZE which sets the input box width in characters.  </s>
<s> Other issues can be identified by using http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/formtest.htm And Amaya is not alone in not adhering to the html4 recommendations about forms --- MSIE, Netscape and Opera each fail at something just not the obvious one of SIZE.  </s>
<s> Renderings such as how a scroll box looks is not in recommendation as Dave says but that it should display multiple selections when that feature is requested is!  </s>
