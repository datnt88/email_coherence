<s> From check-character-normalization "check-character-normalization" true [optional] Check if the characters in the document are fully normalized, as defined in appendix B of [XML 1.1].  </s>
<s> What actions should be expected if a character in the document is not fully normalized?  </s>
<s> I'd assume that an error should be dispatched, but  </s>
<s> the spec doesn't say.  </s>
<s> What should be the behavior if both check-character-normalization and normalize-characters are specified as true?  </s>
<s> Are there any interaction  </s>
<s> between the parameters?  </s>
<s> It might make sense that setting one unsets the other.  </s>
<s> As far as I am aware there are no implementations supporting either of these parameter being true.  </s>

<s> The processor should make that fact available to the application by some means or other.  </s>

<s> LS specifies a 'check-character-normalization-failure' DOMError.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this ought to be in Core, though given the resolution of LSSerializer-iucd-issue it probably won't be.  </s>
<s> pxdom supports both, but only on Python 2.3; earlier versions of the unicodedata module do not provide character normalisation.  </s>

<s> Sorry I missed it since I've been trying to finish up the L3 Core suite at the expense of all the other modules.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate any feedback on the L3 Core tests added yesterday.  </s>
<s> You're touching here an area that is under specified in XML: the XML error catalog.  </s>
<s> Core and Load/Save do provide some of the errors/warnings types that can be generated but we are clearly missing a lot of them.  </s>
<s> I don't think we followed a particular logic on when to define one or not, and it is not the role of the DOM WG to define the error catalog imho.  </s>
<s> We may want to define if it's a warning, or an error at least.  </s>
<s> I'd expect the implementations to check and normalize the characters (doing it in reverse order would be useless).  </s>
<s> Now whether it's going to generate one or two DOMErrors given that both parameters are activated is not defined in the specification.  </s>
<s> Why? normalize-characters doesn't tell you if some characters were unnormalized before normalizing them.  </s>
<s> An application might want to report the number of characters that were normalized as well as doing the normalization without invoking normalizeDocument twice.  </s>
