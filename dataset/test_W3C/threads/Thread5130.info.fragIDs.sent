<s> Hi Richard, Which part of the TAP material did you extract this from?  </s>
<s> I can't find a schema containing the terms to which you refer.  </s>
<s> I'm a little confused by your queries, re. disjunction/exclusion, as I was under the impression that TAP used base-level RDF and hence disjunction wasn't an option.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>
