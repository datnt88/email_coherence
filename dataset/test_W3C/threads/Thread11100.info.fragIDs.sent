<s> At first, I was going to say that this was a poor example and suggest that you considered most of the programming reference books on your shelves, but then I realized that it isn't so bad.  </s>
<s> The only difference is that I think you're assuming that someone typed your example.  </s>
<s> We have hundreds (thousands?) of tabular ASCII report options in various software products.  </s>
<s> The documentation for that software naturally contains samples of those reports.  </s>
<s> I just can't picture myself promoting a language that requires people to go in and add markup to these examples.  </s>
<s> I don't think I could even convince myself to use such a language.  </s>
<s> I feel your pain.  </s>
<s> Could we combine proposals?  </s>
<s> Could we (in XML) define characters to begin a section of text guaranteed not to have markup within, where spaces and newlines should be passed to the application unmolested?  </s>
<s> In other words, a verbatim delimiter?  </s>
<s> (not full CDATA or RCDATA marked sections unless we are  </s>
<s> willing to simplify the rules for those constructs).  </s>
<s> The contents of the delimeters would be restricted to disallow comments, PIs, sub-elements or anything else that would break SGML compatibility.  </s>
<s> Whether processed by an XML or SGML tool, the REs inside the delimeters would be significant.  </s>
<s> Then there would be the existing-SGML-tool compatible way of doing things (which would require you to escape your newlines) and the verbatim-optimized XML way of doing things (which wouldn't).  </s>

<s> At that point it might be best to bite the rest of the bullet and always delimit data.  </s>
<s> Look at the advantages:  </s>
<s> 1. No need to access a DTD to determine if an element is mixed content.  </s>
<s> 2. All REs and RSs are ignored -- full stop!  </s>
<s> (See, I'm internationalized :-) 3. Really easy parsing.  </s>
<s> 4. Much simpler to explain.  </s>

<s> Will the obvious \" work as expected?  </s>
<s> Does "string concatenation" work?  </s>
<s> "this is line one " "this is line two " "this is line three" if so, it can probably be made to fly.  </s>
<s> If not, I think it looks odd enough that you might as well but the bullet and use RTF or TeX syntax, \p{this is line one this is line two this is line three} with no hint of backwards compatibility.  </s>
<s> Then there is no problem.  </s>
<s> But it all seems like overkill to me.  </s>
<s> If you could have a top-level inclusion for #PCDATA, we would always be in mixed content, and the collapse-as-per-mixed-content rules would work fine in both SGML and XML.  </s>
<s> So how about adding the possibility of +(#PCDATA) in SGML? Lee  </s>
