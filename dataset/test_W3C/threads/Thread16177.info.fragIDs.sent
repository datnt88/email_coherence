<s> I need to evaluate for accessibility and am having trouble with the HTML.  </s>
<s> Sincle I'm blind, I  </s>
<s> also am not sure what the intention of the author is (vissually speaking).  </s>
<s> Here's a couple of mysteries I need help with: Note: I'm using IE4.x and Jaws for Windows as my screen reader.  </s>
<s> 1) When first displaying the page, I see an MAP, which seems to be an image with hotspots to click on.  </s>
<s> When I clicked on one, it took me to a page with pointers back to the homepage and seemingly nothing else.  </s>
<s> When I used the tab key to move link to link, I started hearing what appeared to be section numbers.  </s>
<s> Sure enough, clicking on these numbers got me to some text.  </s>
<s> What is the intention here?  </s>
<s> 2) NextLink, a blurb saying see page 30.  </s>
<s> Using the screen-reader functions to read the page by line, this link seems to be imbeded in some text describing the cover.  </s>
<s> The text, however, is not read when the page first displays.  </s>
<s> It does *sometimes* appear when I use the "format page" jaws  </s>
<s> function.  </s>
<s> I think this goes through the internet explorer internal objective discription of the document and changes the layout to allow easier reading.  </s>
<s> It creates single columns out of multiple ones and changes the position of frames to make them more readable.  </s>
<s> However, this document appears to make no use of frames, so why isn't the text spoken when the page is loaded?  </s>
<s> 3) There is text (which is spoken on loading) which says "choose a section... No section numbers are spoken on loading but when using the tab key to navigate from link to link, they are spoken.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> I hope at least some of this makes sense.  </s>
<s> I'm not real sure how to describe this stuff.  </s>
<s> Again, any help is much much appreciated.  </s>

<s> Hi, Rich, what you're encountering here is that you go from a main page *CLICK!* to a page with a map on it.  </s>
<s> That map shows the route of how to walk from somewhere to another.  </s>
<s> Dashed lines in various colors and patterns outline how to walk around.  </s>
<s> You then choose which part of the map to look at and *CLICK* go to a "zoomed in" version of that part of the map; in other words, blown up at a bigger scale.  </s>
<s> Then you can *CLICK* choose which building by clicking on it.  </s>
<s> There are "paths" that lead between the various building, which are numbered (the key appears on the side of the map, as an image -- you may be completely unaware of that! the map key lists numbers which correspond to numbers on the map, and the names of the building.  </s>
<s> Also, the numbers are color coded to correspond to the "paths" of the walking tours.)  </s>
<s> I don't know why it's loading or not loading, per se.  </s>
<s> These are formatted using tables; in fact the whole page heavily uses to tables to make a two-column arrangement.  </s>
<s> On the left column you have: * The cover graphic * A description of it On the right side: * directions link * the "key" to the map, described above * a message from the director * a special thanks link There's more stuff below this, but it's not in the column format.  </s>
<s> This looks like it's the imagemap.  </s>
<s> The image itself has an ALT attribute, but the various areas do NOT.  </s>
<s> You are read a number because that is what the links are named, 24.htm and 6.htm and so forth -- those are the names of the files linked to.  </s>
<s> What I can see tells me that 24, for example, should have ALT text that says "Oviatt Building" and 6 should be "Grand Market Central".  </s>
<s> This information is contained on the graphical map key.  </s>
<s> However, the map key itself has no need to be graphical in nature.  </s>
<s> It really should be presented as text beside numbers, which would be so much more accessible to everyone.  </s>
<s> In fact, the key is a low quality jpg image, which means it is blurry and hard to read when I, someone with (corrected by glasses) 20/20 vision, try to read it.  </s>
<s> The map key is a bad idea as an image overall.  </s>
<s> I hope I described enough for you to be able to identify what you are not able "see" (hear) from this.  </s>
<s> This page needs lots of work to make it usable, I think.  </s>
<s> You are losing too much information because of the way they have put it together; ideally, your description and my description should be the same in content even if the presentation is wrong, but I am seeing lots of things from this site that you have no access to.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps, --Kynn  </s>
<s> It's not accessible.  </s>
<s> For starters, they need ALT text for the image map hot spots.  </s>
<s> Using lynx, a person gets rather unhelpful links to URLS like: Which can only be navigated by trial and error.  </s>
<s> Most of the hot-spots are not available via textual links so you may be better off for this page with browsers other than IE or Netscape.  </s>
<s> This is all stuff that Bobby will tell you.  </s>
<s> The bigger challenge is how to adopt the walking tour directions so that they are usable to someone who is not sited.  </s>
<s> My impression is that the material would be very interesting to most people, including the blind.  </s>
<s> Many of the stopping points have obvious aural and tactile elements to them.  </s>
<s> Of course, you are being contracted by people who are basing a web site on a printed publication (hence the ridiculous link to page thirty) so you may have a great deal of work a head!  </s>
<s> Good luck!  </s>
