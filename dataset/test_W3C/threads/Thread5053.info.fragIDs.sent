<s> I would like to offer the following suggestion as a recommendation re the use of dc:subject.  </s>
<s> I believe the best way to express the fact that a particular image depicts a  </s>
<s> thing which is a member of the class of Lions would be to say: LionImage aAnimalImage; foaf:depicts[aLion].  </s>
<s> Lion  </s>
<s> aowl:Class; subClassOfMammal; Mammalaowl:Class; AnimalImageaowl:Class; The alternative way of expressing similar information is to use the dc:subject property along with the SKOS model [2] for describing concepts that are intended to act as 'subjects' or 'topics' for information resources.  </s>
<s> LionImage aAnimalImage; dc:subjectLionConcept; LionConcept askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Lions'; skos:broaderMammalConcept; MammalConcept askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Mammals'; skos:narrowerLionConcept; The SKOS vocab already defines a class 'Concept' and a set of properties for organising concepts into a hierarchy, without demanding that the hierarchy implies a subclass relationship.  </s>
<s> I refer the WG to the document [2] which outlines the SKOS-Core schema, although you should currently ignore the final section on 'using SKOS-Core with DC and FOAF' as this will change shortly to be in line with the model of usage that I have briefly described here.  </s>

<s> For 'best way', I'm reading, 'most appropriate idiom' rather than 'best RDF property'.  </s>
<s> There will likely be various other RDF vocabs that adopt a similar approach.  </s>
<s> The basic idea with foaf:topic is to be able to say that some Document is 'about' (has as a subject/topic/etc) some particular thing.  </s>
<s> We recently extended this by creating foaf:primaryTopic, for cases where a Document has a very obvious dominant topic.  </s>
<s> Yes. I think the work we do here in the THES/PORT tf will need to do two things.  </s>
<s> We should articulate a vocabulary in the broader/narrower/etc tradition that is sufficient to represent thesauri *as thesauri* (SKOS is an excellent candidate there imho), but we should also go deeper into an explanation into these two fundamentally different (and complimentary) approaches to topic description.  </s>
<s> The thread I started on public-esw-thes yesterday picks up this line of enquiry too, using a geographical example.  </s>
<s> This reminds me, I was going to propose to the WG that the thesaurus/porting tf adopt that mailing list as it's main home, with periodic reports back here.  </s>
<s> Al, everyone, what do you think?  </s>
<s> Dan ps. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/talks/200404-synthesis/ is my brief talk from tuesday's SWAD-Europe meeting.  </s>
<s> Has a few more notes on these issues.  </s>
<s> pps.  </s>
<s> does someone have a pointer to the latest work here on wordnet-in-rdf?  </s>
<s> I'd like to address a couple of points here.  </s>
<s> First, how much should the notes on patterns promote specific vocabulary, such as SKOS?  </s>
<s> For instance, your second solution is almost identical to approach 3 in the note and the only difference (it seems to me) is using a specific SKOS vocabulary (and making all concepts/subjects to be instances of skos:Concept) rather than local concepts that I made up.  </s>
<s> Should the pattern be using that vocabulary, thus encouraging others to use it?  </s>
<s> With SKOS in particular, I am pledging ignorance and have to ask: how accepted is it and would it be premature to refer to it in the note?  </s>
<s> On the one hand, using concepts from other ontologies in the patterns that we produce is a great show-case for the whole SW idea.  </s>
<s> On the other, we don't want to have patterns rely on more transient ontologies (I am not trying to imply that SKOS is transient, just wondering about the general policy).  </s>
<s> Any policy on that that we should have?  </s>
<s> For example, should I change the approach 3 in the pattern to use skos vocabulary as Alistair suggests below?  </s>
<s> For the specific use case, as I've pointed out earlier, what I was trying to use the pattern for is to talk about images/books, etc that are not about specific lions (and book is a better example here), but rather about a class of lions.  </s>
<s> That said, the solution like your first one, comes up often enough (even though it's a different "ontological pattern", to use Aldo's terminology), that it should be included in the note.  </s>
<s> Look for it in version 3. Natasha  </s>
