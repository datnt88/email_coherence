<s> Hello, I'm trying to generate compound documents (XHTML 1.1 with additional namespaces) with Amaya (5.3) and find I cannot get them to validate.  </s>
<s> For example, here is a minimal document built in Amaya.  </s>
<s> However, it does not validate on validator.w3.org, refusing the svg xmlns ... element.  </s>
<s> I found that removing the DOCTYPE allows XML-level validation, but then it is no longer XHTML, is it ?  </s>
<s> How is one supposed to work around this issue ?  </s>
<s> XHTML is supposed to allow compound documents, as specified in but I can't seem to find how to do this, with or without Amaya: the XHTML doctype says the namespace for HTML is "FIXED", thereby not allowing additional namespaces.  </s>

<s> As I understand it this would be easy with Bugzilla, which has a feature to track things as "requested Features" rather than existing bugs.  </s>
<s> Actually I think there is an Amaya wishlist page somewhere, but I haven't looked for it in a long while.  </s>
<s> (The other benefit of Bugzilla would be that it saves the Amaya team from spending their time updating web pages, and lets them concentrate on the work they are doing.) cheers Charles Perhaps a requested features page could be created so that people can check it before requesting a feature.  </s>
