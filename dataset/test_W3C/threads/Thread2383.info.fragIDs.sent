<s> The webmaster@website convention is falling out of use.  </s>
<s> Has anyone considered making it a requirement for HTTP/1.1 compliance?  </s>
<s> Is it too late to even be talking about this?  </s>
<s> There have been numerous occasions where a web site has been sufficiently broken that I could not see any of the pages.  </s>
<s> I try to notify the administrators by sending mail to webmaster@website, but these days, more often than not, the address is unknown.  </s>
<s> Then what am I supposed to do?  </s>
<s> RFC 1123 requires all SMTP servers to support postmaster, so there is a precedent for a requirement like this.  </s>
<s> Or should people be encouraged to report web problems to postmaster when the web site is too broken to show the preferred address?  </s>

<s> I don't think it's too late.  </s>
<s> It is essential that there be some such address, and "webmaster" certainly seems to bve the logical choice.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the term "webmaster" has been coopted (too strong a word?) to refer to HTML authors and web page designers.  </s>
<s> Even so, I don't think it would be overly confusing to use "webmaster" in way you suggest.  </s>
<s> A secondary problem is that many people maintain multiple webs on the same system (e.g., ISPs that provide web hosting) without having a separate domain.  </s>
<s> Typically, this results in URLs like I'm not sure how to handle this situation.  </s>
<s> gjw@wnetc.com / http://www.wnetc.com/home.html  </s>
<s> If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come up with a better one.  </s>
<s> I was pondering this the other day.  </s>
<s> It occurred to me that it would be sensible to be able to ask a web server who the webmaster was for a particular URL.  </s>
<s> Then all such problems could be solved by careful configuration.  </s>
<s> I guess that would need a new method - which could return other stuff that is not normally of interest to the client.  </s>
<s> "INFO url ", perhaps?  </s>

<s> I guess the question is, does postmaster refer to the domain or the server machine.  </s>
<s> I think reality wise, postmaster refers to the server most often.  </s>
<s> (ie sendmail can only direct stuff to postmaster for mail it receives, not that the domain receives... ) So, I think its appropriate that a host running a WWW server must have a webmaster address, which goes to the system maintainer, who can then refer it to the appropriate content author.  </s>
<s> Keep in mind that the message to webmaster may not be a content issue, it may be about a server misconfiguration.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> There i a distinction between content issues (broken links, etc.) and server issues and sometimes people will be sending mail rtegarding one or the other.  </s>
<s> My solution is to set up webmaster@wnetc.com, and almost all mail I receive pertains to issues I can handle.  </s>
<s> If necessary, I can forward it on.  </s>
<s> I suspect tht most people visiting the site won't know the difference between a broken CGI or an errant redirect (things I can address directly) on the one hand, and DNS or connectivity routing issues on the other.  </s>

<s> / http://www.wnetc.com/home.html  </s>
<s> If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come up with a better one.  </s>
<s> There is another RFC in process that was addressing commonly used e-mail addresses like abuse@domain and webmaster@domain.  </s>
<s> I don't recall where it stands with respect to standards-track status and completion, but I think this question is not so central to HTTP that this group should spend effort on something being addresses elsewhere.  </s>
