<s> Hello, I would appreciate if the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model defines whether a default null namespace is represented by a namespace node or not.  </s>
<s> Section 4.5 Namespaces says in 4.5.1 2 The namespace prefix may be the empty sequence.  </s>
<s> If the URI is the zero-length string, the prefix must be the empty sequence.  </s>
<s> Hmm, there might exist namespace nodes without prefix and without URI.  </s>
<s> Such a node would be created by an xmlns="".  </s>
<s> OTOH, I would interpret this as an undeclaration of the default namespace, thus it removes an existing namespace node (that would be present otherwise).  </s>
<s> The specification should unambiguously state, under which circumstances such namespace nodes come into live.  </s>
<s> I prefer not to introduce such "null" namespace nodes.  </s>
<s> There shouldn't be a difference between foo / and foo xmlns="" / One more question: Are situations imaginable that a namespace node doesn't have a parent?  </s>
<s> Since the specification thinks so I would like to see a comment just as for attribute nodes.  </s>

<s> I agree with you, I think the text is wrong.  </s>
<s> There should never be a namespace node whose string value (namespace URI) is zero-length, as namespace nodes always represent the declaration of a namespace and not the undeclaration.  </s>
<s> I think that it is now possible in XSLT to create a parentless namespace node: viz Though this probably isn't what was envisaged when the DM spec was written - at one time there was an idea that namespace nodes would be "shared" between elements in some way.  </s>
