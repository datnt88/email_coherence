<s> Jon, I like the idea of a repair checkpoint.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I would include 2.2 in that list, however.  </s>
<s> I think that this is a "last resort" checkpoint and should remain a P1 checkpoint.  </s>
<s> I haven't reviewed the other checkpoints in the document to see whether there are other repairs that we require.  </s>
<s> I hesitate to use the word "repair" to label the set, but I don't have a counter-proposal right now.  </s>
<s> In the case of HTML event handlers, for example, it's not an authoring error to specify a mouse binding only.  </s>
<s> It is an error with respect to WCAG 1.0: 9.3 For scripts, specify logical event handlers rather than device-dependent event handlers.  </s>
<s> I think we should be able to show why each checkpoint is a repair checkpoint.  </s>

<s> I suggest that we just put the checkpoints 1.2, 9.5 and 9.6 in a special group and call it something like: 1. "Events": seems too general to me, but it is simple and doesn't use the word "repair" 2. "Pointer Events": more specific, but checkpoints 9.5 and 9.6 are more than just pointer events 3. "Mouse Events": sounds very device specific 4. "User interface events": a little more descriptive of the types of events we are interested in We should leave the labels of other checkpoints alone and not try to make major changes with the labeling.  </s>
