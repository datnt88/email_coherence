<s> Instances of temporary disabilities (not caused by injury or illness) include: working in a noisy environment, working in environments where noise is not tolerated (e.g., libraries, work cubicles, and at home when children are sleeping), and instances when hands and eyes are busy (e.g., driving a car).  </s>

<s> Basically people who due to injury or illness temporarily lose some capability, but may regain capability in the future.  </s>
<s> Your descriptions are also valid.  </s>
<s> I think what you wrote is pretty goos, maybe just add an example of a broken arm.  </s>

<s> I am not sure we want to use the exact term "tab" in the doc.  </s>
<s> Although the concept is correct, I see it as a pejoritive term used by us when talking among ourselves.  </s>

<s> I strongly agree with David.  </s>
<s> The derivation &amp; common usage of "TAB" is generally regarded as pejorative and would be out of place in this guidelines document.  </s>

<s> I agree with Judy.  </s>
<s> In the first place, I have never heard of TABs, and I suspect that a high proportion of the world's literate population would be in the same situation.  </s>
<s> Secondly, the guidelines would be better without yet another, potentially confusing acronym.  </s>
<s> Finally, the concept of "universal design", which can be easily explained, seems to encompass all of the general principles and policy considerations which motivate this group's work.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry if I used a wrong word (TAB) in my suggestion.  </s>
<s> I misunderstood it.  </s>
<s> The idea really was to talk in the document how many of the things that help disabled are also in many times beneficial to everybody in different usage environments.  </s>
<s> The goal was to give as much motivation to designers as possible to use these guidelines.  </s>
<s> So talking about universal design and explaining it in this way is just fine.  </s>
