<s> Hello everyone, I'm writing a substantial article and recommendation for accessible content authoring for online media services.  </s>
<s> As well as covering existing standards, software and devices, I would like to get people thinking about the future of accessibility today.  </s>
<s> This way, we can keep an eye on development and let vendors know our requirements.  </s>
<s> I'm looking for any suggestions, especially in the area of authoring tools.  </s>
<s> What features can we give HTML editors (for example) to make them: 1.  </s>
<s> Output more accessible code and 2. make the applications themselves accessible to impaired users.  </s>
<s> Quick thoughts of my own on point 1 - having a 'structural' mode, which doesn't allow any "display tags", such as font .  </s>
<s> For example, the EM emphasis structure tag is allowed, but I Italic, is not.  </s>
<s> this will encourage the use of stylesheets, and aid in the transition to a full XML environment.  </s>
<s> Word processors are particularly bad at outputting HTML that is full of very specific font tags.  </s>
<s> Visual editors often use complex tables for layout.  </s>
<s> these Apps should have modes which disable visual formatting, and strip HTML to structure + stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Point 2 - simply have the software prompt the user for ALT, TITLE and LONGDESC tags for images and links.  </s>
<s> this should speed up authoring by not requiring manual selection of fields which are often hard to get to, because sighted designers rarely use them.  </s>
<s> This feature would also encourage sighted designers to consider Accessibility, because it becomes less of a chore.  </s>
<s> Maybe it could be extended further, with a database of title and ALT tags which are associated with regularly used URLs or images files for automatic insertion.  </s>
<s> That's just a start, I'm sure there is much to add.  </s>
<s> Thanks, David Sheehy on behalf of RPH Australia  </s>
<s> David, Getting authoring tools to support production of accessible content is indeed an important way to ensure that there is more accessible content on the Web.  </s>
<s> That is why W3C/WAI developed, with input from many organizations and individuals, the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (ATAG) http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG which were released as a W3C Recommendation on February 3, 2000.  </s>
<s> You might want to visit the ATAG press release http://www.w3.org/2000/02/ATAG-PressRelease and the testimonials and fact sheet that are linked from the release.  </s>
<s> There are currently a number of authoring tool developers working on implementations of ATAG.  </s>
