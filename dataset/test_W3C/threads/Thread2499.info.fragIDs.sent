<s> This functionality is important, but underspecified in the current spec.  </s>
<s> The spec does not specify for how long or which URLs the redirect applies to, or how proxies can deal with or generate similar responses.  </s>

<s> The request SHOULD be accompanied by a 'Set-proxy' response header indicating what proxy is to be used.  </s>
<s> The client will parse the 'Set- proxy' header as defined below to decide how long, for what URLs it should use the specified proxy.  </s>
<s> If the 305 response is not accompanied by a 'Set-proxy' header, it MUST be accompanied by a 'Location' header.  </s>
<s> The 'Location' header will specify a URL to the proxy.  </s>
<s> If both headers are present in the response, the client SHOULD use the 'Set-proxy' header only.  </s>

<s> The 306 response code MUST be accompanied by the 'Set-proxy' response J. Cohen HTTP/1.1 305 and 306 Response Codes [Page 2] INTERNET-DRAFT 5 December 1996 header.  </s>
<s> The client or proxy will parse the 'Set-proxy' header to determine which proxy to use, how long to use it, and for which URLs to use it.  </s>
<s> The scope in the set-proxy header is considered an optional advisory.  </s>
<s> The client or proxy may choose to ignore it, and use it for just this request, for all requests, or for a scope previously or implicitly defined by another configuration method or autoconfiguration system.  </s>
<s> 1.3 506 Redirection Failed The 506 response is returned when a redirection fails or is refused by a proxy or client.  </s>
<s> If the redirection response included a body, then it SHOULD be included in the 506 response.  </s>

<s> Possible modes are: J. Cohen HTTP/1.1 305 and 306 Response Codes [Page 3] INTERNET-DRAFT 5 December 1996 DIRECT Attempt to connect directly, with no proxy  </s>
<s> IPL Initial Program Load, the client or proxy should attempt to revert  </s>
<s> back to its default or initial proxy setting.  </s>
<s> This is meant to instruct a client to re-fetch its proxy configuration, or PAC file.  </s>
<s> When set, the accompanying scope field MUST be "*" A client receiv- ing this response SHOULD prompt the user for confirmation.  </s>
<s> If accompanied by a 'proxyURI' parameter, a proxy or client MAY use the value as a URL containing a configuration to retrieve.  </s>
<s> If a client does so, it MUST prompt the user for confirmation.  </s>
<s> SET Set to parameter "proxyURI".  </s>
<s> The client should use the URL speci- fied for "proxyURI" as the proxy.  </s>
<s> If the SET mode is specified, the parameter, "proxyURI", MUST be present.  </s>
<s> Scope Scope refers to a regular expression pattern that specifies which URIs are subject to this header setting.  </s>
<s> URIs should be matched against the scope with this rule : The scope "*" means all requests The scope "-" means this EXACT URL ONLY Otherwise, the URL is compared with the regular expression scope.  </s>
<s> The lifetime parameter specifies how long the specified proxy should be used.  </s>
<s> If lifetime is specified as "seconds" then the proxy set- ting remains in effect for 'integer' seconds.  </s>
<s> If lifetime is speci- fied in 'hits' then the proxy setting remains in effect for 'integer' transactions.  </s>
<s> 2.2 Location Header In the original HTTP/1.1 spec, the 'Location' header was used to indicate the proxy setting.  </s>
<s> Its use is DEPRECATED by the 'Set- proxy' header in the context of a 305 response.  </s>
<s> All new implementa- tions MUST send the Set-proxy header.  </s>
<s> Implementations MAY send the 'Location' header so as to allow backward compatibility.  </s>
<s> J. Cohen HTTP/1.1 305 and 306 Response Codes [Page 4] INTERNET-DRAFT 5 December 1996 If the 'Location' header is specified, it should contain a URI of the proxy.  </s>
<s> If the Set-proxy header is not specified, the client should use this proxy for just one request, and only for the origi- nally requested exact URL.  </s>
<s> 3.0 Methods A client or proxy receiving a 305 or 306, should use the OPTIONS method to determine if the server or proxy it is talking to actually is an HTTP/1.1 server supporting 305 and 306 responses.  </s>

<s> A proxy server MUST not forward a 305 or 306 respose code (unless it generated the 306).  </s>
<s> * A webserver MUST NOT send a 306 response under any circumstances * A proxy server MUST NOT generate a 305 response.  </s>
<s> * A client or proxy SHOULD NOT accept a 306 from a proxy that it learned of via a 305 response code.  </s>
<s> * A client or proxy MAY maintain state and allow a lifetime to extend beyond a session or restart.  </s>
<s> * A 'Set-proxy: IPL' SHOULD override any previous 'Set-proxy' header.  </s>
<s> * A 305 or 306 response MAY contain a body containing an explanation of the redirect for clients which do not understand the redirect * In the absence of any parameter, the following defaults should be used: lifetime = this transaction only scope = this exact URL only * When receiving a 305 response, the client or proxy will enforce the following rule with respect to the scope.  </s>
<s> The scope specified must be more restrictive than the transformed URL in question based on the rightmost slash in the URI.  </s>
<s> Example: (in order of restrictiveness) for URI = http://www.ups.com/services/index.html J. Cohen HTTP/1.1 305 and 306 Response Codes [Page 6] INTERNET-DRAFT 5 December 1996 If the scope returned with a 305 response is less restrictive than the requested URL, the client may reject the redirection and return 506 Redirection Failed.  </s>
<s> If the client wished to honor the redirect, it client MUST prompt the user for confirmation before accepting the new proxy setting.  </s>
<s> * Since HTTP/1.0 proxies may unknowingly forward a 305 or 306 response code that was generated maliciously or in good faith, the client must attempt to ascertain if the proxy with which it is directly communicating is HTTP/1.1 and if it supports the 'Set- proxy' header.  </s>
<s> To determine this, the client or proxy should use the OPTIONS method to make a request check for this feature.  </s>
<s> The extension string should be 'set-proxy' in the OPTIONS request.  </s>
<s> Security Considerations Great care should be taken when implementing client side actions based on the 305 or 306.  </s>
<s> Since older proxies may unknowingly for- ward either of these reponses, clients should be prepared to check the validity.  </s>
<s> * Please read the section 'Operational Constraints' * A client or proxy MUST NOT accept a 305 response from a proxy.  </s>
<s> * A client or proxy MUST NOT accept a 306 response from an origin server.  </s>
<s> * When receiving a 306 response from a proxy, the client MUST verify that the proxy supports the 306 response with an OPTIONS request.  </s>

<s> RFC 2068 doesn't contain a regular expression grammar, so of course one must be defined before regular expressions can be used in HTTP.  </s>
<s> There is one in RFC 2168 "Resolution of Uniform Resource Identifiers using the Domain Name System", but the authors seem not to like it very much - there's a note to the effect that regular expressions are complex and error-prone, as well as rarely useful.  </s>
<s> Ross Patterson Sterling Software, Inc. VM Software Division  </s>
<s> While I may agree that regular expressions are more complex than some other types of wildcard pattern languages, regular expressions in general are most certainly very useful for some Web applications.  </s>
<s> As an example, Netscape Proxy moved to using regular expressions instead of shell expressions due to high number of customer requests.  </s>
<s> Many URL patterns simply could not be expressed with shell expressions, e.g. a pattern that matches URLs without an FQHN.  </s>
<s> It may well be that regular expressions are not necessary for the particular application we're discussing here, but that decision should be based purely on the application's requirements, not subjective statements in other RFCs.  </s>
<s> The question to pose is, can the 305/306 scope rules be expressed using the single wildcard '*' as opposed to full regular expressions.  </s>
<s> The purist answer is 'no'; you may want to specify a proxy redirection for non-FQHN URLs.  </s>
<s> However, if this seems like an unlikely application, and a viable trade against simplicity, then yes, maybe '*' is sufficient.  </s>
