<s> My code for interfacing to Annotea via Mozilla is now available at  </s>
<s> A list of annotations is displayed in the sidebar, with the capability to display the bodies of the annotations, and an attempt to find the section of the document being annotated.  </s>
<s> There are instructions on installation, screenshots, and the source code can be browsed.  </s>
<s> Bugs can also be filed.  </s>
<s> Please feel free to comment.  </s>
<s> Thanks to Art Barstow for sorting out the problem with the content type.  </s>

<s> This is great!  </s>
<s> Thank you all for doing it/helping to do it.  </s>

<s> Excellent Matthew!  </s>
<s> I intend to demo the bookmarklet stuff at the WWW10 Semantic Web Developer's Day: Please let me know your thoughts about me also demo'ing Annozilla.  </s>
<s> I'm looking forward to trying it.  </s>

<s> Go for it!  </s>

<s> I just wanted to pass on some info that may be helpful if you want to try Matthew's Annozilla: o It didn't work for me with Mozilla 0.6 but worked fine after I installed 0.8.1 [Linux, x86, Red Hat]: o If you need to create an account, see:  </s>
<s> [Note that a '+' sign in the user name causes a problem so don't use that char until the problem is fixed.]  </s>
<s> o In Edit- Preferences- Annozilla, set the Annotation server to:  </s>
<s> o To see some annotations, go to:  </s>

<s> Kudos, Matthew; this is wonderful work.  </s>
<s> I'll buy you a beverage of your choice at our first face-to-face opportunity :-) I was puzzled at first why clicking on one of the annotations in the sidebar seemed to do nothing after prompting me for my username/password again.  </s>
<s> Then I discovered I should scroll the Annozilla sidebar down to see the body text box.  </s>
<s> Can I configure things so the body text box pops up in a new (desktop) window?  </s>
<s> Thanks for this hint, Art.  </s>
<s> It certainly tripped me up since I had registered as swick+annotate in re-register for a new account.  </s>
<s> (Note to Marja: don't double-count me as a user for WWW10 :-) Do you know where this problem might lie?  </s>
<s> I also notice that annotations on my 'home' page are not displayed immediately after restarting Mozilla until I go to a different page and then back to my home page.  </s>
<s> I tried Shift+Ctrl+R to reload my home page but this doesn't seem to have changed anything; still have to visit a different page then backup.  </s>
<s> The Annotea servlet received "swick annotate" [the '+' was replaced with a space] so my guess is that Annozilla needs to URL encode the username before it sends it to the servlet.  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> Matthew, As far I understood, you cannot create yet annotations with Annozilla.  </s>
<s> Could you add a paragraph in your doc saying so in your project home page and add a link from it to the Annotea project (like consult this page if you want to see other clients, including clients that can create annotations).  </s>
<s> Or, as an alternative, say that currently, you can only create annotations with Amaya and Art's bookmarklet.  </s>
<s> This way users will know how those annotations were made :) Thanks, -jose  </s>
<s> This is now mentioned on the installation page and has been reported as a bug: Users can report bugs themselves (although they will have to register first).  </s>
<s> Matthew  </s>
<s> That shouldn't be too hard, I have raised it as and will get round to it soon.  </s>
<s> Some URL escaping thing.  </s>
<s> I already escape the user name, but I'm wondering if I need to escape the whole URL again afterwards.  </s>
<s> Hmm...  </s>
<s> OK: http://mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=262  </s>
<s> Matthew  </s>
<s> I do encode the username, etc., before passing them, but neither Mozilla nor IE5 think that a '+' needs to be encoded.  </s>
<s> I can change the code to manually encode a '+' (I've tested this and it works), but it seems a little odd.  </s>
