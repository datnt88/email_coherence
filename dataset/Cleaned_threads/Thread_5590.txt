<s> hello all i got a 250gb maxtor internal drive that i put in a usb 2 0 external enclosure </s>
<s> i set the jumper to master per the instructions that came with the enclosure </s>
<s> i plan on only using it for file storage </s>
<s> i was setting it up last night and the computer recognized a new usb drive and i installed the drivers for it the drivers that came with the enclosure </s>
<s> it did not show up in my computer which was predicted in the instructions </s>
<s> then i installed the software that came with the hd </s>
<s> it found the hd and said that it was brand new and needed to be formatted </s>
<s> that was around 10pm last night </s>
<s> around 9am this morning when i left for work it was still spinning </s>
<s> the progress bar hadn t moved is it possible that it will take this long </s>
<s> vital stats p3 700 mhz computer windows 98se thanks in advance </s>
<s> my usb 2 0 connected 160gb drive formatted in less than one hour </s>
<s> but since you have a p3 99 99 of p3s will have usb 1 1 let me do a guess on time here </s>
<s> i ll state that 160gb completed in 1 hour on my p3 600 usb 2 0 connected drive </s>
<s> if that was true and you connected via usb 1 1 likely </s>
<s> then a straightforward bit of math shows usb 2 0 speed usb 1 1 speed times 250 160 hours or 480 11 times 1 56 68 18 hours </s>
<s> you ll have to give it about 3 days </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i do have a usb 2 0 card in the computer which makes it sound like something is not working properly </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> should i have installed the drivers from the hard drive or the drivers from the usb 2 0 external enclosure </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> 1 the file system will only support 127gb or 137gb in total on that drive </s>
<s> i don t want to duplicate all that is known about this so catch up about this at 2 notes the usual usb 2 0 issues </s>
<s> but in a laptop it gets worse </s>
<s> very few can install windows properly </s>
<s> they ll forget some motherboard or other driver </s>
<s> support is waning for this old os but by this time you should be an old hand at corraling the motherboard drivers reading usbman and more </s>
<s> this os hasn t been offered for 5 years so it s not seen as much and people seem to be forgetting how it works </s>
<s> bob </s>
