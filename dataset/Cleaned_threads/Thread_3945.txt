<s> hi all i am looking to assemble a piv machine and the vendor has offered me the following configuration piv 2 66 ghz mbd intel 102 transient or is it quot transcient quot ram 1 ghz quot 533 mhz speed quot i would appreciate inputs and insights on the capabilities of the mbd and the ram </s>
<s> any urls that i can read up on </s>
<s> tia sanjay </s>
<s> there are many pentium 4 processors and many intel motherboards that work with the p4 processor </s>
<s> quot intel 102 quot is not a common name for an intel motherboard </s>
<s> look at these current intel motherboards to see typical names </s>
<s> there are also quot intel compatible quot motherboards which means that there are companies other than intel that make motherboards that use intel processors </s>
<s> quot transcend quot is the brand name of your ram </s>
<s> quot 102 quot is probably the vendor s internal designation of the motherboard </s>
<s> i don t recommend buying any p4 now since most will be effectively discontinued at the end of the month when core 2 duo debuts </s>
<s> the remaining p4ds will drop in price dramatically so you ll be able to afford a faster cpu </s>
<s> p4d 945 3 4ghz 800mhz 2x2mb 163 now 316 p4d 915 2 8ghz 800mhz 2x2mb 133 now 169 p4d 820 2 8ghz 800mhz 2x1mb 113 now 169 p4d 805 2 66ghz 533mhz 2x1mb 93 now 115 </s>
<s> hello there thanks for your response </s>
<s> i got back to the vendor who says it is original intel d102 motherboard </s>
<s> does that help </s>
<s> i would like to know the performance of this mbd and whether there are any known bugs for which patches are available not available </s>
<s> thanks again sanjay </s>
<s> hello thanks for the tip </s>
<s> my purchase decision gets postponed till end july first week of august </s>
<s> which motherboard will suit the piv duals best btw </s>
<s> and is there anything better than transcend rams </s>
<s> how is the performance of these transcend memories </s>
<s> any inputs on these are highly appreciated </s>
<s> tia sanjay </s>
<s> this is the only intel quot d102 quot motherboard i could find at intel com intel makes solid motherboards but they don t have a reputation for being great overclockers important for high end gamers </s>
<s> the board is very small microatx size so it is not very expandable </s>
<s> look for a full atx motherboard if you plan to make this a gaming media center or a computer for some use that might require many add in cards sound card 56k modem tv tuner physx card etc </s>
<s> transcend s an ok brand </s>
<s> corsair probably has the best rep as high performance ram companies </s>
<s> crucial is considered high quality ram also </s>
<s> ocz geil patriot and transcend are other companies who make high performance flashy ram </s>
<s> kingston and pny are mainstream ram and generally slower </s>
<s> as for motherboards it depends on your budget </s>
<s> if you re willing to spend another 100 you can probably get a core 2 duo cpu and a 965 based motherboard </s>
<s> but you ll have to wait a few more weeks and run the usual risks of being an early adopter of new technology </s>
<s> if you re budget concious but want to be able to possibly upgrade to a core 2 duo in the future i d recommend getting a mobo based on the 946g chipset </s>
<s> here s intel s model it has built in graphics sound lan supports 4 sata devices 2 ata ide devices 8 usb ports and pci express slots for high performance graphics </s>
<s> it only 2 ram slots so i d recommend filling them with 2gb </s>
<s> if you just want a good inexpensive pc now then get a motherboard based on the 945g chipset </s>
<s> here are 2 suggestions biostar 93 asus 115 </s>
<s> hello ramarc thanks for the insight and detailed information </s>
<s> much appreciated </s>
<s> cheers sanjay </s>
<s> hello linkit oh okay this feature of microsize was not pointed out by my box pushing vendor </s>
<s> i guess i will go in for the 945 series motherboard that ramarc has recommended in this thread </s>
<s> thanks for your tips much appreciated </s>
<s> regards sanjay </s>
