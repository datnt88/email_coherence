<s> is there any advantage going from vga to vga to dvi adapter then to dvi input on monitor </s>
<s> or the same as going straight vga to vga on monitor </s>
<s> is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out </s>
<s> currently my machine has onboard radeon x300 x550 series </s>
<s> quot vga gt vga to dvi adapter gt dvi any advantage quot none at all unless that s what is needed to connect the monitor you have </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> the adapter is just wires to send the signal to the proper pins </s>
<s> quot is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out </s>
<s> currently my machine has onboard radeon x300 x550 series quot i want to lump these two questions into one </s>
<s> almost any video card can outperform onboard video </s>
<s> so there is an advantage there </s>

<s> hello thanks </s>
<s> i just did a search and found that the benefit of dvi is that digi signal goes straight to monitor whereas vga converts it to analog first and thats where the quality is lost </s>
<s> so in my case i just stick with vga or upgrade my vid card </s>
<s> if you open it up it s just wires to run the vga signals from the vga connection the the dvi </s>
<s> what magic is this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> is it correct that because the original video signal created by the cpu is digital then using the dvi output from the card eliminates a d to a conversion </s>
<s> notes the five dvi connection types </s>
<s> which is being used in your system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> common sense says i have to side with robert </s>
<s> for an average joe user like me surfing doing a little video stuffs etc </s>
<s> vga should do just fine i won t go out and spend big bucks for dvi hardwares </s>
<s> but if hi def video is your thing then dvi will be needed </s>
<s> so how s the new year been treating you so far </s>
<s> hopefully better than last year </s>
<s> art </s>
