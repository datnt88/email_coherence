<s> my current desktop is old slow and failing </s>
<s> i need to buy a new one soon but i can t afford a high end system </s>
<s> i would like to be able to connect a stereo to my new desktop to transfer old vinyl and cassettes to cd </s>
<s> i would also like to transfer digital video from my computer to a vcr </s>
<s> it seems everything i can afford has integrated audio and most have integrated video also </s>
<s> if i buy such a system can audio and video cards be bought and inserted later </s>
<s> i m particularly interested in the audio in out </s>
<s> upgrading the audio in a system with integrated sound is somewhat easier then upgrading video with the same parameters </s>
<s> a lot a integrated video motherboards do not offer an agp slot to upgrade but most have at least one pci slot available for sound </s>
<s> yes you can upgrade your audio and video on an integrated motherboard </s>
<s> it is very easy to make those changes in the bios set up on your motherboard </s>
<s> i purchased an integrated motherboard recently and didn t like the on board sound so i disabled it and i am using a sound blaster live card which takes up one pci slot </s>
<s> the same thing can be accomplished with your on board video </s>
