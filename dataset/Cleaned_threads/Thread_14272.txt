<s> i m running a windows 98 on my home pc and windows xp on the laptop </s>
<s> now i m seeing all these new flash drives with enchanced windows vista ready boost </s>
<s> my question is do i really need a flash drive with this feature or should i just get a regular normal flash drive without this feature and the useless u3 feature as well </s>
<s> also i know the u3 feature can be taken out but can the ready boost feature be taken out as well </s>
<s> i m concerned if it will take up space for something that i won t use </s>
<s> thanks very much </s>
<s> runs with vista superfetch feature only but you can add this to your computer format it and convert the entire drive to virtual memory </s>
<s> a chip to chip connection is better then a chip to drive connection </s>
<s> this will give an older system more virtual memory some say it works better with older systems then newer ones </s>
<s> once installed and formatted the drive should not be removed so put it in a rear usb port on the desk top </s>
<s> a 2gb usb can be bought for about 20 00 or less </s>
<s> thanks sorry i wasn t specific enough i don t want to increase my virtual memory i just want a flash drive to store music files and data files but my concern is if the ready boost feature takes up a significant amount of space on the flash drive because i want all the space i can get for other files </s>
<s> so i just wanted to know if those features could be taken out or any comparability issues i may run into but by your post i suppose just reformatting the flash drive will take care of any extras </s>
<s> see system in control panel change settings or advanced then under virtual memory you can set the upper and lower limits manually or automatically </s>
<s> you needn t reformat unless your using ready boost </s>
