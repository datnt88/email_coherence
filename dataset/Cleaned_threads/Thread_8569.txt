<s> i ll try to make this short </s>
<s> i bought a digital camcorder and realized that i don t have a dvd burner on my desktop comp </s>
<s> i purchased a mad dog external dvd burner 18x dual format that i have not connected yet </s>
<s> my computer only has usb 1 ports </s>
<s> i have been lead to believe that the dvd burner will be real slow unless i use usb 2 i bought a usb2 firewire pci card at radio shack </s>
<s> after plugging it in the slot the directions say to plug in the power supply to the card into the small 4 prong receptacle on the card </s>
<s> no power cord was supplied nor are there any that seem to be unused in my computer </s>
<s> there is a power plug unused that has 4 inline receptacles but that configuration would not match the 4 small square receptacle on the card </s>
<s> is there a plug available for me to buy to power this card </s>
<s> does it connect to that unsed 4 inline plug that is available in my pc </s>
<s> is there a usb2 pci card that doesn t need a power supply </s>
<s> your power cable cord should be an unused one from the system s power supply </s>
<s> if you don t have an extra one or one that matches then you need to buy one </s>
<s> however you offered no info on the usb firewire card what model it is </s>
<s> if it is a typical system power connector required you can get a y cable which splits one power lead into two found at many computer suppliers but this is a guess on my part </s>
<s> just be sure to follow the install instructions take that with you to rs maybe they got what you need or ask for more info </s>
<s> if none of this helps with that rs product return it it useless get a more generic usb2 0 pci card if you need firewire a combo pci card from another source </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> for less than usd 40 you could install an internal dual layer dvd burner that will be faster than any usb burner </s>
<s> no extra pci card needed </s>
<s> if so yeah it doesn t appear to come with any extra items </s>
<s> if that connecter on the rear portion is like one on your hd power connection get a y cable </s>
<s> if like the one for the floppy drive get one that matches again as a y cable with dual type connection fd and hd type </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> willy yes that is the card </s>
<s> as i said there is an unused 4 pronged inline plug available but that would not fit the card nor even reach it </s>
<s> i am hoping rs has the plug available when i go back </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> as for the internal dvd vs external i wrestled with that but went with an external even though they are more expensive because i have 2 other computers a laptop and another desk top neither of which has a dvd burner so i figured i would be able to use the 1 burner for 3 computers </s>
<s> plus my main pc s almost 4 yrs old so i might soon need to buy a new one anyway </s>
<s> thanks for the replies </s>
