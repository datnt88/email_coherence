<s> i have a xps gen 4 i have one gig of ram memory 250 hard drive and since my son has lots of games on it i d like to purchase more memory </s>
<s> of course he says i should buy geil or cosair extreme memory </s>
<s> here are two choices i found </s>

<s> i have a wdc wd2500jd 75hbco 233 gb hard drive in there now </s>
<s> it says that there is 229 gb 182gb 80 free space ntfs i don t think that more hard disk space is nessasary with all that free space </s>
<s> running xp home he has these games on </s>
<s> desert combat battle field 2 call of duty 2 postal 2 delta force black hawlk down i have a nvidia ge force 6800 the system gets slow some times when he is doing online gaming etc </s>
<s> i thought that the extra memory to juggle with might help </s>
<s> i don t really know anything about computers so maybe i m wrong </s>
<s> for the games listed you might see some improvement with more ram but tweaking may help more </s>
<s> for example battlefield 2 can consume gt 1gb on its own but you can reduce ram usage and stuttering by setting texture quality to medium </s>
<s> also make sure you defrag your hd and use a fixed page file 1 1x your fixed ram since content fetches are typically the cause of stuttering </s>
<s> 2gb will be the power user setting when vista debuts early next year so if you plan to keep the pc for 18 months a ram upgrade may be more worthwile </s>
<s> but if you plan to get a new pc in 2007 tweak what you ve got </s>
<s> while a nice video card there are much faster now </s>
<s> it s only my opinion that 1gb is plenty for today </s>
<s> about your hard disk </s>
<s> 500gb maxline pro 500 sata 3 0gb internal hard drive internal hard drive with 500gb capacity 7200rpm spindle speed 16mb cache buffer 8 5ms average seek time </s>
<s> beats the one you have on seek time and if your board supports it has twice the transfer rate in bursts </s>
