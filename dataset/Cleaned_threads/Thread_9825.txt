<s> i had a problem with my computer </s>
<s> piv 512 ram win xpsp2 1 6 ghz </s>
<s> the other day the computer wouldn t start </s>
<s> i unplugged it for a while and it fire up </s>
<s> when it got to the point of loading the anti virus program the computer would just shut off </s>
<s> tried this several times and the same thing happened </s>
<s> started in safe mode uninstalled the anti virus program restarted and everything seemed ok when i started to reinstall the anti virus and the machine shut off again </s>
<s> i wouldn t restart untill it was unplugged for a while </s>
<s> i began to think the hard drive was going so maybe a reformt and reinstall windows would do the trick </s>
<s> nope about 5 minutes into the installation the computer would just shut down again </s>
<s> tried that several times and it just shuts down </s>
<s> i figured it was the hard drive was on its way out so i bought a new one installed it and the same thing happened </s>
<s> maybe it isn t the hard drive thats the problem </s>
<s> the only thing that is in it extra from when i got it is an upgraded video card </s>
<s> ati 256mg </s>
<s> i am now thinking it maybe the power supply that is failing </s>
<s> the computer is about 6 years old </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> the problem </s>
<s> how many times have you opened it up to dust it out and clean the heat sinks of the lint dust accumulation as well as check the fans </s>

<s> i clean out the inside every 6 12 months all fans and cooling fins are clean as a whistle </s>
<s> no dust or dirt anywhere </s>
<s> honestly </s>
<s> also a cpu heatsink cockeyed can do that </s>
<s> we have many parts to consider from that to power supplies </s>
