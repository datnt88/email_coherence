<s> after a ton of deliberation i have finally nailed down a final build </s>
<s> would you guys mind reviewing it from a compatibility and value perspective </s>
<s> motherboard gpu cpu ram hdd dvd burner hsf os and which case do you prefer </s>
<s> thanks to everybody who helped me and who does help me </s>
<s> i like the choices so far except the hdd believe this is a better choice 320gb per platter higher data densitiy faster reads and writes </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> psu </s>
<s> i also will be crossfiring a second 4870 in the future </s>
<s> when there are outstanding psus with more watts and amps than you need for 50 60 less </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i may crossfire 2 4870x2 s in the future </s>
<s> just want plenty of room </s>
<s> calculators and it calculated your current psu requirement at 338 watts </s>
<s> if you add another 4870 gpu another hdd another dvd plus 4 usbs and 2 120mm fan it only calls for psu with 527 watts lt 40 amps </s>
<s> i m a firm believer in capacity or room to grow but a 1000 watt psu for a system requiring less than 350 watt or 527 watts is over the top even for this builder of 22 years </s>
<s> good luck on your choices and your build </s>
