<s> i just upgraded to the 7900gto and i m barely getting higher framerates especially in graphically complex areas </s>
<s> am i bottlenecking at my cpu or memory </s>
<s> i wouldn t think that to be the case but i m willing to hear suggestions </s>
<s> ps i ve started ocing the video card to just under 7900gtx levels without problems but still no big gains </s>
<s> i ve also tried ocing my cpu to 2 2ghz with no temp adversity but doesn t seem to help </s>
<s> you will only see significant gain when the resolution is high enough otherwise you are bottlenecking on your cpu </s>
<s> try a higher resolution see if you get good framerates otherwise you might need to check your psu to see if it giving you enough power to the video card </s>
<s> i have an antec true power 550 so i know it has the juice required </s>
<s> i ll try different resolutions though </s>
<s> that can often be an issue </s>

<s> just wondering about your psu amps </s>
<s> you probably already know its not just wattage but amps too </s>
