<s> hello i ve just bought a new dell dimension 8400 with cd rw and dvd rw drives </s>
<s> i m having a problem with playing back audio on the cd drive </s>
<s> data recording playback works well on both drives </s>
<s> dell tech support are not much use so i thought i d seek other opinions </s>
<s> i m an pc amateur but i think my pc is configured with a single ide cable from the motherboard which goes to the cd middle connector and dvd end connector </s>
<s> my cd sound is choppy in this configuration </s>
<s> i tried swapping the cables round and found that the dvd sound was choppy </s>
<s> so whichever device is connected to the middle cable connector gives poor sound </s>
<s> it s identified as 2 on the cable </s>
<s> my simple brain told me that there s probably a problem with the ide cable so i ordered a new one from dell </s>
<s> however when i searched the net i found all sorts of confusing stuff about slaves masters cable select so i m starting to wonder if it is the cable or whether something is set up incorrectly with my system bear in mind it s less than a month old and you d have thought </s>
<s> that dell would have set it up correctly </s>
<s> if anyone has any insights into this problem i d been very grateful the dell tech support guys seem little more qualified than me </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> sounds as if you may have sniffed it out </s>
<s> try the new cable then post back the results </s>
<s> best of luck </s>
<s> hi i hav the same problem as you i have just bought a new dell computer and the sound quality on the dvd drive is very poor </s>
<s> if you find out what the problem is can you please tell me so i can fix it </s>
<s> thanks mike </s>
<s> this is not dell s repair center </s>
<s> do give it to them to fix it </s>
<s> bob </s>
