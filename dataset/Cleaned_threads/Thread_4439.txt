<s> greetings i am considering trying to do a rebuild </s>
<s> i have never done this before </s>
<s> below i have described the majors i have already </s>
<s> i would like suggestions on a board and processor that would fit my atx case with a sata hd </s>
<s> this is what graphics card ati radeon platinum edition x850xt sapphire agp8x 256 mb asus motherboard a7m266 d dual socket motherboard with amd 762 chipset and ddr dimm sdram ddr 256 pc2700 ram i got two sticks i defanately want to use a sata hard drive antec sx1040b case previously i was using a ide connection hard drive i want to goto satai presently have i would not mind buying a combo board and processor </s>
<s> the back of my mind says im crazy for trying to do this </s>
<s> the other side says go for it and dont be intimidated </s>
<s> nascar4num9 </s>
<s> are you trying to keep reuse those components </s>
<s> i really need suggestions on a new motherboard and processors that would go along with my existing sata hd graphics card and ram </s>
<s> my range is about 500 to 600 </s>
<s> possibly a motherboard processor package </s>
<s> thanks nascar4num9 </s>
<s> if you proceed with this quot upgrade quot you ll wind up with a pc that s still behind the curve </s>
<s> anyway here s an agp based mobo for 70 and a core2duo 2 4ghz e4600 for 120 since you re willing to spend some money start from scratch core2duo 3 0ghz e8400 180 4gb ddr2 800 85 ecs 9600gt 512mb 147 gigabyte p35 mobo 82 about 500 gets you a top performing pc </s>
<s> what im thinking about doing is a serious upgrade </s>
<s> performance wise can i use my sata hard drive </s>
<s> also on my graphics card is this one that you would upgrade </s>
<s> thanks nascar </s>
<s> is the case up to date to fit all new motherboards </s>
<s> atx i assume so </s>
<s> and the 9600gt is the best bang for the buck video card </s>
<s> if you add a new case and power supply like the antec sonata iii below for 100 you can try to sell your old pc for 150 or get a 400 tax deduction by donating it to charity </s>
<s> ok i was able to get this old box working and install a new hard drive </s>
<s> news is that due to its age my new arca sim racing game will not work so im going to take the challenge on </s>
<s> im not that up with all the hardware stuff </s>
<s> the gentelman that suggested the things above i think are excellent suggestions </s>
<s> what if i wanted to put say another 600 bucks in the deal </s>
<s> that would total out to 1 100 </s>
<s> if you were in my situation what setup would you get </s>
<s> also will my existing case support the new mobo </s>
<s> thanks nascar4num9 </s>
