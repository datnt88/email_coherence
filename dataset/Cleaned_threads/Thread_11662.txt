<s> i am planning to buy this netgear router netgear n600 wireless dual band router wndr3400 the description of this route says i can get a combined thruput of 300 300 because it is a dual band now my laptop has got an intel centrino advanced n 6200 wi fi adapter </s>
<s> the description of adapter says it works in dual band and will give me 300 max throughput </s>
<s> question can i configure this adapter in laptop to work in dual band and get 300 300 max throughput </s>
<s> i have yet to find anyone achieve this since all the adapters or on 2 4 or the other band </s>
<s> not both at the same time </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> in my laptop i can see there is an option to set my intel wireless adapter to either 2 4 or 5 or multi band if i were to change to multi band and use this router shudnt i get 300 300 </s>
<s> but why not try and convince yourself </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i ve seen such seek one or the other but i fear you think it will do both at the same time </s>
<s> a short course in the design would be needed to explain why beyond the simple answers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it doesn t really matter because you won t even get the 300 in the first place </s>
<s> besides the fact that no home user has 300m internet wireless technology is half duplex </s>
<s> so to your question there is no standard defined for the bonding of 2 4 and 5 channels into a single stream </s>
<s> this means if this ability even existed it would a be a proprietary thing which would mean both your nic and your router would have to come from the same vendor </s>
<s> if you want to write your own drivers and firmware it is technically possible i suppose </s>
<s> you could in theory also get 2 completely separate lan connections up if your pc nic allows this the router more than likely does </s>
<s> but now you have the larger issue of how to use 2 lan connection at the same time </s>
<s> this is the how do i run 2 internet connections question that there is no good answer for </s>
<s> the radio is on one band or another </s>
<s> not both </s>
<s> at least that s what the spec sheet said </s>
