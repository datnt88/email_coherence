<s> hi guys need to know if i should get a dual simultaneous band router </s>
<s> this wireless adaptor is n class with an ism maximum frequency of 2 4ghz and a unii maximum frequency of 5 ghz </s>
<s> does this mean it will work in the more stable and faster 5 ghz band or is it strictly 2 4ghz </s>
<s> i have to buy a new router so for 100 more i ll get one that does both bands simultaneously but if this adaptor can t run on 5ghz i ll save some money and just get a dual band </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> 802 11a u nii bands 5 15 to 5 25 would mean you want 802 11a gear and not the 802 11n 5 8ghz gear i ve seen </s>
<s> so the dual band router is unlikely to help </s>
<s> interesting </s>
