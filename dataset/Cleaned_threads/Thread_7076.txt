<s> hello i have an older machine and can t afford to really get a new system atm </s>
<s> i play online games like wow and ffxiv mmo and was wondering if buying a better video card would help my bad fps problem </s>
<s> i know i have a piece of crap machine so here it goes i have amd athlon 64 dual core 3 10ghz with a asus m3a78 cm motherboard and a nvidia geforce gt 240 video card </s>
<s> running windows 7 with 4 gigs of ram </s>
<s> atm until i can afford a newer machine all i want is better fps and it doesn t need to be ultra graphics or anything just running around without being so choppy in 25 man wow s and normal ffxiv gameplay would be good enough </s>
<s> would a better video do this for me and if so can you recommend a video card that will use its full potential in my motherboard without bottlenecking a great deal </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> a boost within your budget only caution make sure you have enough psu to support the new video </s>
<s> with gpus the faster they go the more power psu they need to drive them </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> the 240 is a 70w card </s>
<s> a hd 7770 is a 80w card </s>
<s> just a guess your psu will support the extra 10w </s>
<s> the 7770 is quite a bit more video power but that does not mean you will see more fp s if video power is not the hang up </s>
<s> you will need a pci e power connector from the psu best check </s>
<s> your cpu is probably not a huge issue but upgrading a graphics card that significantly improves frame rates is tricky </s>
<s> you have to see what speed your pcie slot runs at </s>
<s> plus you have to possibly upgrade power supply to run any significant card upgrade </s>
<s> as i said your motherboard maybe somewhat limiting your options if your pcie slot runs at a 2 0 or 1 1 speed </s>
<s> if its newer it might run at the higher speed </s>
<s> this makes a big difference on weather a new card can fully improve speeds or is de clocked because of your motherboard </s>
