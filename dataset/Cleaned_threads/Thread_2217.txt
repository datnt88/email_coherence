<s> hi need some help here </s>
<s> i can t seem to turn on the computer sometimes although i keep pressing the power on button </s>
<s> sometimes it works and the computer works fine </s>
<s> what do you guys think is the problem </s>
<s> im a newbie at this so i d like to know what is the likely cause before i take the thing to pieces </s>
<s> thanks for replying </s>
<s> some power on switches do go bad its not that common </s>
<s> the atx power supplies when pushing the power button takes time to react and its best maintain pressing until the system starts to power on </s>
<s> the frt </s>
<s> panel power sw is usually has a wire harness to the mtrbd </s>
<s> it maybe not seated fully or the crimps of connector pins are flimsy check all that by opening case and inspect </s>
<s> the power supply itself maybe flaky and starting to fail </s>
<s> if this is a new system use the warranty or call in the problem </s>
<s> you may have other problems but if you feel uncomfortable in fixing it it maybe best to allow a pro at it or a quot trusted but knowledgable quot friend at it </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> how old is the computer what brand and model processor type etc </s>
<s> when you can t get it to start if you unplug the power plug and put it back in does it make any difference </s>
<s> how often does it not stat up </s>
<s> when you power up the pc watch the fans and especially the ps fan </s>
<s> if it twitches and stops and the pc does not boot this usually means the ps has detected an improper load and has shut down </s>
<s> if the fans do nothing it could be the mentioned momentary switch </s>
<s> a marginal ps can do this because the startup current is higher than the run current </s>
<s> this could explain why it sometimes works and sometimes does not </s>
<s> of course make sure the ps can supply sufficient current for your hardware configuration </s>
<s> good luck </s>
