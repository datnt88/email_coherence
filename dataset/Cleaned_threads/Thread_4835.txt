<s> my motherboard is asus model p4ge mx i replaced a 1 7ghz processor with a 3 06 processor </s>
<s> the problem is that when i try to load the os the system freezes which is not the case when i inset the old processor </s>
<s> pliz help </s>
<s> 1 post 9 repeats what i know </s>
<s> 2 i see you replaced the cpu but what about the power supply </s>
<s> that bump up will cause some spikes in the power draw that could crash the system </s>
<s> 3 that is also issues with freezes later in the case of both items 1 2 and if the heat sink and compound are not up to the job </s>
<s> often i find the old heatsink on the new cpu and folk wondering what happened </s>
<s> sometimes they need a lot of convincing </s>
<s> sadly that convincing is done by hours on the bill </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you need to visit the asus support website and check your model mtrbd </s>
<s> and thus reveiw what s present </s>
<s> check the current cpu list of the what s supported </s>
<s> plus verify or check the current bios level you have </s>
<s> this in turn also allows the latest supported cpu and or additions that may not have been supported when your pc 1st came out </s>
<s> this will greatly enhance the later cpu install as yours </s>
<s> also you need to check the cpu specs and family class in or to best match similar cpus </s>
<s> visiting the cpu maker support website will do that for ya </s>
<s> if you check the stk on the cpu itself will zero in on what you have no guessing </s>
<s> once all that is accomplished you have a better understanding into the overall cpu supported and what if anything isn t </s>
<s> your new 3 09mhz seems odd imo but then again if you review what is supported it may fit in </s>
<s> doing all this will provide what is anything is supported </s>
<s> alas ther bios if it needs to be updated will best provided by asus just be sure to get the right one </s>
<s> all this on top of what robert suggested as it applies </s>
<s> thus this is amtter of sorting out the details as it were </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
