<s> i have a host dell desktop with xp and a guest emachine desktop also with xp </s>
<s> i have a linksys broadband router and a linksys wireless card </s>
<s> the dell has working internet with no problems </s>
<s> i have tried to set up a network many times and the wireless connection is fine </s>
<s> however the local area connection says quot the network cable is unplugged quot </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its wireless right </s>
<s> what does this mean </s>
<s> ethernet port in the back of your pc </s>
<s> xp could be reporting it as being unplugged </s>
<s> im sorry but i dont know where the ethernet port is that probably means i have an unused one </s>
<s> a telephone jack would but slightly bigger </s>
<s> usually on the back panel of a new pc </s>
<s> yes they are both empty is that bad </s>
<s> it would just indicate that windows is properly reporting that you are not using the ethernet port </s>
<s> since your wireless connection is working there is no problem </s>
<s> it says the wireless connection is working but i cannot access the internet on that computer </s>
<s> did you enable dhcp on the router wap did you get an ip address </s>
<s> did you use wep or wpa security </s>
<s> have you tried to add your wifi network to this computer </s>
<s> tell us how you install your wifi and the setting you have done </s>
<s> quot the dell has working internet with no problems </s>
<s> i have tried to set up a network many times and the wireless connection is fine quot it appears you have a working internet connection </s>
<s> i had been using dhcp but i checked and it had not put in the settings correctly </s>
<s> i then stopped using dhcp i put in the settings without it </s>
<s> i did get an ip address i used wep 128 bit security i tried to install the network on the main computer and it said quot the wizard cannot create a wireles network either because a wireless network adapter is not installed or because software for the wireless network adapter is not installed quot i just installed it but i didn t get a choice on what channel to use and it chose the wrong one it picked 6 my other computer is using 11 how do i change that </s>
<s> im sorry the computer that needs the wireless connection says the wireless connection is fine but i still have no access to the internet on it the computer that directly connects to the router has working internet </s>
<s> u have 2 local area connections turn off the one thats not for ur wireless connection </s>
