<s> hi buying my first camcorder for use with a powerbook g4 which will probably be replaced with an imac with leopard next year </s>
<s> i don t plan on buying anything fancy and hope to keep it to around 300 400 </s>
<s> is there any camcorder in that price range that seems to work better than others with macs </s>
<s> or is there any reason to think the jvc gr d650 which seems to suit my needs wouldn t work </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> a firewire port also known as dv port or ieee1394 or i link </s>
<s> the camcorder manufacturers jvc panasonic sony canon samsung and the rest never put a firewire cable in the box so you need buy one 4 pin camera 6 pin computer </s>
<s> don t go cheap </s>
<s> i use a monster firewire cable 6 footer was 25 </s>
<s> gold contacts works great </s>
<s> according to the gr d650 manual see page 9 under quot connectors quot the dv port is near the usb port item 21 also note on page 12 no i link cable </s>
<s> see page 44 note the quot optional dv cable quot from what i can tell this jvc is a bottom loader </s>
<s> if you use a tripod which you should this makes changing tapes a bit of a challenge </s>
<s> i use a sony hdr hc1 and have learned some quot work arounds quot but they are not efficient </s>
<s> my son uses a canon elura 60 on his g4 powerbook take a look at the elura 100 it is a top loader and 20x optical zoom compared to the jvc s 15x other tips use a tripod </s>
<s> turn off digital zoom use only optical zoom </s>
<s> have fun </s>
<s> i like the panasonic and dislike any of the dvd type cameras firewire is currently the only way to go with a camera connected to a mac </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> i just purchased a panasonic sdr h18 </s>
<s> the video transfers to my computer fine using the software in the box imagemixer </s>
<s> but i can not get it to imovie or because it shows up as a quot mod quot file </s>
<s> does anyone know what that is and how to send these movies to my clients so they can view them on their pcs </s>
<s> i am using a mac </s>
<s> also i am assuming this camcorder does not have a dv port because it says nothing about it in the manual </s>
<s> obviously i am a newbie to camcorders </s>
<s> can you give me any advice </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> this is the latest list of camera s that apple have tested with imovie 08 this is the list hope this helps apple tech support claim that imovie 08 will not accept video audio up the usb ports </s>
<s> however on friday i was using a sony hd based camera and imported video from it into imovie 08 imovie could not see the camera when the camera icon in imovie was pressed </s>
<s> it could only see the built in isight camera </s>
<s> importing ok up the usb port but no live recording with that camera </s>
<s> it did not have a firewire port by any name on the camera </s>
<s> also on some hard drive camera s if there is sd as well as hd content on the drive the sd content has to be erased before imovie will import the hd content </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> 1 you need to install streamclip and scroll up 2 once in imovie you can save as various formats and compressions </s>
<s> quicktime files will include a quot mov quot extension </s>
<s> the version of imovie being used will depend on the export method but the broad instruction is when you are in imovie with the project active under file select quot share quot or quot export quot and follow the steps </s>
<s> if the files are large because you want your clients to see good high quality versions of the video in a window bigger than 2 quot x3 quot consider subscribing to a file upload service like quot yousendit com quot </s>
<s> 3 the sdr h18 is a consumer grade hard drive based camcorder and does not save in dv format minidv tape based camcorders do as do external hard drives like those from firestore </s>
<s> if you have people paying you for video service you would be wise to ditch this consumer grade internal hard drive based camcorder and move up in video quality to minidv tape </s>
<s> no this camcorder does not use firewire for video transfer hence no dv port to which the firewire cable would connect </s>
<s> 4 quot mac quot is an acronym in computer networking for m edia a ccess c ontrol among other things apple makes macintosh computers and an operating system nicknamed quot mac quot not an acronym </s>
