<s> hi i want to buy a portable hard drive 2 5 quot inch external with casing </s>
<s> 250 gb seems appropriate capacity for me </s>
<s> i have used two portable hard drives hitachi travelstar 80gb and 160gb bought without enclosure and fixed into one later </s>
<s> both of them seem to be working fine still </s>
<s> one for about 2 years and another one for 8 months </s>
<s> now i am not too sure which company to rely on </s>
<s> hitachi don t make drives like wd and others which come packed into the casing </s>
<s> is it a better idea to buy a hard drive and its enclosure separately </s>
<s> or the ones that come with enclosures sold by manufacturers are more reliable </s>
<s> i am looking at toshiba wd lacie iomega </s>
<s> not too sure which one to go with </s>
<s> any advice or personal experiences will be really helpful </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it seems like there is no specific answer to my question </s>
<s> but maybe some suggestions </s>
<s> still waiting </s>
<s> my suggestion would be to get a complete unit </s>
<s> this way you know the thing works or don t work </s>
<s> if it doesn t work then just return it no decession as to which part of the unit is bad </s>
<s> personally i always build mine 3 5 quot and i have used maxtor wd etc </s>
<s> which ever give me the best bargain </s>
<s> i found these thing are fairly reliable </s>
<s> just my thought </s>
<s> its quite small about lets say a notebook </s>
<s> only choice because quot costco is cheaper quot is what my parents say but in the end i choosed between 150 and 250 pros comes with wd syn small from 60 250gb cons the wire is small i got mine around 90 to back up my dad s music one day when the music was missing due to system recovery long time ago </s>
<s> thanks for the replies </s>
<s> i will get a wd passport soon </s>
<s> i guess there are not many options </s>
<s> plenty of info on hard disk drives external and otherwise already here in the storage forum </s>
<s> here s some info from a cnst storage poll </s>
