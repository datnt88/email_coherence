<s> i can not turn on my computer </s>
<s> i opened it and realised that the power supply is out so i changed it but still sadly nothing happense when i try to turn the computer on </s>
<s> can any one help me with this matter please </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> four pieces plus a beep </s>
<s> but first imagine if everyone used your subject title </s>
<s> take a moment to craft something more like changed the power supply and it still doesn t something </s>
<s> in fact i can t tell if it turns on or not </s>
<s> my definition of quot on quot here is fans spinning </s>
<s> not that windows works or linux </s>
<s> so given so little words you could try just the psu motherboard speaker and the cpu heatsinkfan and see if it will power up and beep </s>
<s> if not you are looking at the four possible bad parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> in addition to mr proffitt s comments if there are no signs of life fans hdd led etc </s>
<s> you may have a bad switch </s>
<s> check to make sure the voltage is set to 110 instead of 220 and power is on on the back of new power supply </s>
<s> i looked at one last week that all was wrong was power was off on back of ps </s>
<s> there are two ways that might get your computer going </s>
<s> 1 disconect your bios battery </s>
<s> your bios batter is a nickle size quot silver quot battery located near your bios chip </s>
<s> take the battery out and after 5 seconds place it back in </s>
<s> 2 check your motherboard manual for a jumper connection by your bios chip </s>
<s> the jumper has three terminals </s>
<s> move the jumper over to the bare terminal </s>
<s> that wil turn your bios off clearing your bios </s>
<s> after a few seconds move the jumper back </s>
<s> just be sure to ground yourself to the chassis before you touch anything </s>
<s> static electricity can kill your motherboard </s>
<s> hope this works </s>
<s> good luck </s>
