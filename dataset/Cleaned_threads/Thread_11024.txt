<s> hi i have a hard drive ide but i cant access to my data so i decided 2 format it and recover it after that but i cant format it </s>

<s> i assume you know that once you have reformatted a hard drive there will not be any data to recover </s>
<s> or did i not understand your post correctly </s>
<s> tell us more </s>
<s> what are you attempting to do and why </s>
<s> which os and what make model computer </s>
<s> is this hard drive the one with your operating system os on it </s>
<s> if so how are you trying to reformat it </s>
<s> generally you cannot reformat a hard drive which has the os installed whilst you are logged in to that os </s>
<s> the os will not let itself be deleted like that </s>
<s> you will need to format it using tools with the os not loaded </s>
<s> why can t you access the data </s>
<s> what error messages do you see </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> you offer nothin in how or what the pc is </s>
<s> if you simply plan to format i suggest now you google and then use killdisk or dban pgms </s>
<s> that totally wipe out the hd </s>
<s> then reformat using the windoze os disc i suspect to reuse the hd </s>
<s> there will be no data to recover unless the data is on another hd or partition </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> is this an external hard drive </s>
<s> very confusing post </s>
<s> now i have xp but the speed is very low so i wanna instal 98 and i need the driver </s>
