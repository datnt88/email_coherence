<s> hi its me again will i be able to keep my programs and such intack when i transfer my harddrive and stuff over to the new motherboard </s>
<s> or will i have to reinstall all of my programs again </s>
<s> im just tryin to decide if i should backup my data for my programs before i take my pc in to the computer place </s>
<s> i have windows xp </s>
<s> reside on the hd not the motherboard </s>
<s> but back up anyway </s>
<s> xp can be picky when changing too much hardware </s>
<s> and the motherboard carrys a lot of weight </s>
<s> take it to the computer place </s>
<s> ok thank you very much </s>
<s> ideally ur programs shud work with the new motherboard with xp detecting all the new hardware that is identified </s>
<s> though it wud be nice if u had a fresh installation for ur new motherboard from scratch </s>
<s> but if u cannot afford that u shud be able to wrk ur old xp installation with the new motherboard </s>
<s> but there is no harm in backing up ur data </s>
<s> in same scenario but want old programs and games transfered to new hdd s with a clean install of xp pro </s>
<s> i am changing most things in my comp but want the games and patches that i took hours to download to work hopefully from the neww 2 x wd caviar 80gb sata drives i got with k8v se deluxe asus mobo and amd 64 3000 cpu thanx bj </s>
