<s> i recently purchased the netgear ma111 wireless adapter as well as netgear s wireless router </s>
<s> the router works fine w the computer when the computer was plugged into it via ethernet cable </s>
<s> however when i try to access the internet w the usb adapter only it does not work </s>
<s> i spoke with netgear s tech support and we ran ipconfig which seemed to indicate the existence of the internet </s>
<s> nevertheless i could not access any site including the config site for the router </s>
<s> also i am running windows 98se </s>
<s> thanks corey </s>
<s> if the product is non functional it may be best to pack it up and try another product </s>
<s> you may have issues with usb or didn t follow their install notes </s>
<s> has many posts where the usb devices are plugged in before the drivers or the motherboard drivers are not installed and usb problems just like yours begin </s>
<s> i read no mention of details on your part about removal of the ethernet card setting the mode of the usb wifi and more </s>
<s> this lack of information leads me to think that returning the product will save you a lot of work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the ethernet card is integrated in the laptop </s>
<s> i am not sure how i would remove it </s>
<s> i did install the driver prior to inserting the adapter </s>
<s> based on this information do you think it is still more likely that the product is defective </s>
<s> is this a common occurrence </s>
<s> thanks corey </s>
<s> you can use the device manager to disable the network card so windows won t try to remember it and use it instead of the wifi card </s>
<s> the product is indeed defective if the instructions didn t work for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> good luck getting any help with netgear s 3rd world support people or the quot slim quot documention that comes with their products </s>
<s> that said i got my netgear system up and running in 2 days mostly by myself </s>
<s> i m not familar with the usb wireless unit that you re using with your laptop </s>
<s> i m running the wg511 pc card and it works fine </s>
<s> perhaps you should go that route instead </s>
<s> i hear the problems don t exist with the pc card and i may return my usb adapter for the pc card one </s>
<s> any suggestions for a quick fix to get it to work </s>
<s> there must be some reason albeit minorly complicated and laborious involving configuration </s>
<s> and i know the adapter works i tried it on an xp laptop </s>
