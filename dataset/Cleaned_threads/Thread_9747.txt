<s> alright this is pretty weird to me i m on the computer and the screen goes black </s>
<s> i can hear the computer still running though it s much quieter than normal </s>
<s> i open it up turn it back on and see that none of fans chipset cpu cooling plugged into the motherboard s fan headers are spinning </s>
<s> the motherboards s led light still turns on and the hard drives still spin when i turn it on so i know it s nothing to do with the power supply it s less than a month old anyway </s>
<s> i tried plugging the fans into the power supply bypassing the mobo using an adapter like this when i did this the fans all began working again but the computer still wouldn t boot </s>
<s> the led lights would start and the hard drives would spin but no post beeps would sound </s>
<s> is my mobo trash </s>
<s> you have to tell us more </s>
<s> mobo make cpu type etc </s>
<s> some mobo s will save your cpu by closing down if the cpu fan stops </s>
<s> let s hope that yours is one of them </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> the motherboard is an abit kr7a via kt266a socket a and the cpu is an amd athlon xp 1700 1 47 ghz </s>
<s> okay i disconnected and reconnected the atx power supply cord to the motherboard and it seems to have fixed the problem the fan headers are again working as normal </s>
<s> anyone know what causes this to happen in the first place </s>
<s> if its new take advantage of your warrenty pack it up and rma it </s>
<s> you may have what some call quot componet creep quot </s>
<s> the off on thus hot cold operation of the system can cause wiring harness ics and or cards some movement preventing a good contact </s>
<s> one reason i mention reseating cards and harness several times to break the metal metal contact crust tarnish plus fully reseat same </s>
<s> it happens from time to time especially in systems that experience alot of heat build up </s>
<s> just like a car after running a longtime upon shutdown you notice the pinging tweeking of metal as it cools </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> lol once again willy very well spoken </s>
<s> let the vendor deal with it </s>
<s> i love your style </s>
