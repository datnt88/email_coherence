<s> please let me know what you think i am ordering the adaptec card to run raid 5 with 4 hdd ordered 5 in case one dies img img </s>
<s> my only caveat is that you didn t use a quot redundant quot power server case </s>
<s> everything else appears ok too </s>
<s> as for the case that psu will do but here too you may want to have a spare psu </s>
<s> now make darn sure all of this is well cooled which a server case would have provided and have amble room as well </s>
<s> just check out server cases to get a feel of what i m suggesting here </s>
<s> i do like 100 you use a true server mtrbd tada willy </s>
<s> is raid 5 for the os and data fine </s>
<s> i will be installing the os on raid 5 then i will be using windows to partiton a new storage quot drive quot </s>
<s> is this fine to do </s>
<s> of the system that supports it </s>
<s> does the system store only family pics tax records or is it used for business and earning a living too </s>
<s> the question is what level of redundancy and backup are you looking for </s>
<s> what if the system was hit by voltage spikes lightning flood tornado etc </s>
<s> raid 5 and having a spare hdd is great but but you may need to think beyond that if you want ensure system availability data access and continuity of business </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> the above link should provide an idea of the raid levels on what they do </s>
<s> raid 5 is the robust but still you need the care of a master backup to include other back ups on a regular basis </s>
<s> while raid 5 provides for its own data safety the world still makes it rough at times thus backups are more than a good idea </s>
<s> on top of all this the master backup i suggested is for return a working network if a major failure comes about you can restart again reloading the basic network and then using whatever other backups to return to some date of last backup etc i mention this only if all else fails you have something to return to </s>
<s> while i didn t suggested before you may want to look at ms home server 2011 or similar to better handle network demands </s>
<s> while win7 will provide for a decent networking setup it becomes a more stretched use of the os </s>
<s> home server os provides a ready os to better handle the demands of networking just a thought to pass on </s>
<s> i also suggest you get your hands on quot networking s w tools quot that are capable of networking needs </s>
<s> i mention this just as method to make life easier though you have to find this out by trail and error what suits you </s>
<s> google away for such tools and there are freebies or low cost ones </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i use a simple nas and for more speed and a second copy a low power 10 watt netbook </s>
<s> about 20 watts for both </s>
