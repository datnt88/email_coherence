<s> hi all a guy i work with asked me to help him out </s>
<s> his hard drive seems to have some bad sectors and he has lost some of his data </s>
<s> he has since bought a new machine and i have the hdd to see if i can retrieve anything </s>
<s> what he told me was that at the point of failure his data was lost but his wife s data was still accessible on the same drive </s>
<s> the drive has not been partitioned </s>
<s> is there anyway to retrieve the data </s>
<s> i have not yet plugged it into my machine to check but thought i would submit a post in the meantime </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> look up pc file inspector on google com </s>
<s> do not attempt to use repair tools on that drive </s>
<s> you don t want to boot it or write to it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> for the help with this problem as well bob </s>
<s> cheers </s>
