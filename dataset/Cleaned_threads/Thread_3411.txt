<s> i know that the wireless not working is an oft asked question but i have browsed through what i thought were relevant threads and also the first sticky thread and i can t find what i m doing wrong or maybe it s there somewhere but i have no idea how to use the solutions given </s>
<s> hopefully someone can help me out or point me in the right direction </s>
<s> i have set up my network in the suggested way in the sticky thread with the exception of setting the wpa </s>
<s> when i select the wpa option it doesn t give me any place to input a password </s>
<s> so i have it set on the wep 64 bits umm is that bad </s>
<s> it is now wall gt cable modem gt wireless router gt pc laptop it all worked fine before until i formatted my pc </s>
<s> i must have mucked around with some settings and since the format i can t connect my laptop to the router wirelessly </s>
<s> when i plug my pc to the router with an ethernet cable it works fine same with the laptop </s>
<s> on my laptop i can see the ssid there when i search for networks but it fails to connect because it is not receiving a response from the router or access point </s>
<s> i have attempted unplugging and replugging and powering off and on and resetting both the modem and the router </s>
<s> i ve tried reinstalling the driver and utilities </s>
<s> i m fairly certain it s something in the settings of the router that i ve got wrong rather than the router being broken as it was working fine before the format </s>
<s> i tried my brothers laptop as well and it also couldn t connect because there was no reponse </s>
<s> the modem is a motorola sb5101 the router is a diamond digital r100 </s>
<s> my pc is running on xp and my laptop is running on vista </s>
<s> let me know if there s any other info needed </s>
<s> any help would be much appreciated this is driving me insane </s>
<s> head out and test the laptop at a free wifi hotspot </s>
<s> if that works i reset the router to factory settings and then set it up again per our forum sticky </s>
<s> without that test you re never sure where the issue is </s>
<s> thanks for the tip however i forgot to mention i can connect to someone elses a neighbour </s>
<s> unsecured wireless on my laptop without any issues </s>
<s> is that kind of the same as testing it at a free wifi hotspot </s>
<s> having done that i ve tried resetting the router several times already and gone through the setup process as per the sticky and using the manual </s>
<s> the lights are all blinking as normal too </s>
<s> try disabling the security features first </s>
<s> go with an open system </s>
<s> you ll need a wired connection to the router to do this </s>
<s> make sure it will handle giving out dhcp addresses </s>
<s> on you laptop if you are trying to use the wireless card s configuration utility i suggest using the windows one instead </s>
<s> make sure that if your router handles the ip addresses your laptop s wireless device is set to dhcp </s>
<s> with this basic configuration you should be able to connect </s>
<s> you should see an quot acquiring ip address message quot </s>
<s> this should mean that the laptop and router at least acknowledge each other s presence </s>
<s> if this works you can begin to reapply the security features </s>
<s> i must think that if you can select wpa as an option there s a way to plug in your code passphrase </s>
<s> not always are these on the same screen in the router configuration </s>
<s> you may need to search for it </s>
<s> these security settings can be picky </s>
<s> you ll see some wanting hex and some alpha numeric </s>
<s> some won t accept certain characters and some are fairly free with what you can plug in </s>
<s> you ll likely have to type in a long code two or more times </s>
<s> what i ve found simpler is to type it out once in something like notepad </s>
<s> save the file and put it on a flash drive or some such </s>
<s> you can copy and past the code into the appropriate boxes for both your router and laptop </s>
<s> this helps eliminate those maddening typos where you know it wasn t your mistake </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> unless you missed a setup or forget to unplug the ethernet after you setup the router the wifi on the router looks dead to me </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the help guys </s>
<s> i set it up again from scratch and made a tiny improvement in that my laptop would connect for a while a minute or so before disconnecting itself </s>
<s> i ve bought a new router so i m praying the problem is the old router and not the settings or else i ve just bought a new router that won t work either thanks again </s>
