<s> i ve just recently moved to a new house and switched from a broadband connection to dsl and ever since then i can t stay connected to aim or msn chat services or even connect to limewire anymore </s>
<s> i ve tried other chat and p2p clients but still none work </s>
<s> how can i fix this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> try the virus forum and use the tools noted there to clean up as well as winsockfix noted in that forum </s>
<s> hopefully you can recover enough to avoid a total wipe and reinstall of this os </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> woah calm down </s>
<s> i run frequent virus scans with several programs and comes up </s>
<s> viruses aren t my problem </s>
<s> these are not viruses and are well known to damage the os </s>
<s> giddy up </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i run spyware and adware scans frequently too </s>
<s> but let s get off this subject please </s>
<s> if not why not </s>
<s> first please run another scan with adaware and spybot just to be sure nothing snuck in when you weren t looking </s>
<s> bob s point in the other subthread is that quot frequent scans quot isn t frequent enough when something unknown has happened since the last scan </s>
<s> and if you are running windows xp get their new spyware scanner and run it too it is a very good utility and finds stuff that adaware and spybot miss </s>
<s> now on to the next part dsl is one of many forms of broadband and it dsl comes in many flavors </s>
<s> it s like saying you just changed your primary form of roadway transport from an automobile to a chevrolet </s>
<s> not much information there a chevy is an automobile and chevy makes a number of models </s>
<s> so can you tell us some specifics about your dsl provider name connection type and hardware involved modem type and is a router in the configuration </s>
<s> assuming there are no malware issues and you can get to the general internet without trouble two possibilities come to mind quickly you are having a port forwarding issue for these specific services that needs to be resolved in your modem routing configuration or in your software firewalling if you are using any such or your isp is doing some sort of quot traffic management quot by blocking certain ports or packet types </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> i m have alltel dsl at 1 5 mbps connection running through a regular router </s>
<s> anything else </s>
