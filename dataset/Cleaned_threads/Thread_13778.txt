<s> recently i bought q8400 quad proceesor and intel dg43gt motherboard but its giving cpu fan error in the startup if i disable cpu fan warning from the bios then it doesnt give the error </s>
<s> can anybody help me </s>
<s> if this is the stock cpu fan that came with the cpu kit then be sure to mount it correctly </s>
<s> then assure you re using the proper cpu fan power connection on the mtrbd </s>
<s> and set the bios for such etc as required </s>
<s> now verify if any temp setting that too is set to default for now </s>
<s> check all bios setting as these bios setting get spread out all over the menu when in bios check it out anyways </s>
<s> save any changes etc </s>
<s> and save upon exit and check results </s>
<s> if not a stock cpu fan again be sure its mounted correctly </s>
<s> proper thermo paste etc </s>
<s> and fan what direction it blows on or off the cpu </s>
<s> its important as best operation may dictate that but each vendor may follow their best situation </s>
<s> of course the hsf setup is graded for your cpu installed </s>
<s> it actually provides info that q8400 is listed and not some quad cpu rated below that </s>
<s> take this advice quot do not take anything for granted quot check it and verify before damage can result </s>
<s> also don t disable the warning once properly set it should become stable </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> are you using the stock intel hs fan </s>
<s> and you re sure the fan is connected to processor fan header 4 pin </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> thanks for the advice its a stock fan i removed and fixed several times but still i am getting the same warninig error what should i do now help </s>
<s> since this is a stock fan then it must be using the same wiring as its mtrbd </s>
<s> connection thus a 4 pin for 4 wire plug etc if not then that s not correct </s>
<s> also because you ve mounted this several times you may have defeated the thermo tape scheme of application you did remove the protective cover </s>
<s> you can simply clean remove the thermo tape application and use arctic silver in its place </s>
<s> last you need a bios update as this mtrbd </s>
<s> takes several different cpus it could have been stocked too long and a bios update correct this glitch but aware of what if any bios updates does </s>
<s> you problem should be a simple fix or re running the correct install </s>
<s> otherwise it boils down to some outside error you have no knowledge of </s>
<s> its a manufacturing glitch mis wiring bad cpu or bad mtrbd </s>
<s> in some fashion or even possible weak psu </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> sometimes you get an error message if the fan rpm is below a certain user designated level or because the cpu is running above a default temp </s>
<s> if checking and or changing the settings don t help go direct to intel for tech support </s>
<s> let us know the outcome </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> first of all i will thanks to everybody for helping me i have updated the bios of the motherboard and problem got solved but one advice i will give when i started updating bios the display gone blank for 10 mins and after that bios update process got started </s>
