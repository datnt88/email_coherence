<s> recently because of serious system instability i ran chkdsk to see if the problem was related to bad clusters </s>
<s> of course chkdsk found a string of errors reporting things such as quot deleting corrupt attribute record quot quot deleting index entry quot and so on </s>
<s> after a long wait the system rebooted but i found my system even more unstable </s>
<s> later i found out through the event viewer that chkdsk did something to numerous files in attempt to repair them </s>
<s> among those were windows core system dll s </s>
<s> when i tried to look for those files they did not exist anywhere on the hard drive </s>
<s> i am afraid that maybe chkdsk didn t do a good job repairing the flies </s>
<s> perhaps what chkdsk did was just overwriting the bad sectors </s>
<s> i thought at least chkdsk could move the file segments on that specific sector to another healthy sector to maintain file integrity </s>
<s> i dare not to use chkdsk again in the future lest it should delete files by accident rendering software personal data or even windows useless </s>
<s> my question is should i expect chkdsk to repair the hard drive while also maintaining data integrity </s>
<s> or is there any other way to do exactly the tasks mentioned above </s>
<s> i m going to decline writing what chkdsk does and note it won t repair damaged files or a damages os </s>
<s> for that the tools vary with the os </s>
<s> sometimes it s sfc scannow and for other oses it s something else </s>
<s> with all the malware out there chkdsk is only a minor tool in the kit </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> did you run just chkdsk or did you use chkdsk f r </s>
<s> chkdsk by itself will only check the disk with f or r or both will move the info to good sectors </s>
<s> depending on the size of disk it may take awhile </s>
<s> also it may only happen on a reboot cause it needs exclusive rights to the drive </s>
<s> sfc command will take you to original values you will need to go to microsoft update after the sfc was run </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> well i manually made chkdsk to run at bootup so that it can have so called quot exclusive access quot to the harddrive </s>
<s> my os was not damaged before i ran chkdsk it was just unstable which i later found out to be ntune s fault </s>
<s> but after i ran chkdsk some core system files were gone such as msxml3r dll etc </s>
<s> and these files were all reported as quot located in bad sector and was repaired quot in chkdsk s log </s>
<s> even sfc scannow did not totally recover them </s>
<s> i had to copy the dll s from my original xp cd </s>
<s> what i want to know is whether it s normal to lose data while disk utilities such as chkdsk are doing their job </s>
<s> it s all about backup </s>
<s> but let s tackle msxml3 since last week i ran into that and it was annoying that regsvr32 msxml3 dll fails but if you download msxml3 msi and install that then all is well </s>
<s> go figure why </s>
<s> here s the msxml3 msi i used to correct this one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it might be worth trying system file checker </s>
<s> you will need your xp cd handy or if on your harddrive as a partition it will find any files itself click start gt run gt type cmd press ok this will bring up a command prompt type in sfc scannow make sure you have a space after sfc hopefully this should repair or replace any corrupt or missing system files </s>
<s> tigger </s>
<s> well then i guess it s prime time for me to make a backup of my drive </s>
<s> it seems that i can t totally rely on chkdsk </s>
<s> hopefully the bad sectors won t spread any faster </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> chkdsk is a little boy sent out to do a big man s job </s>
<s> there are several utilities that claim to do this job but only 1 that i know really does the job </s>
<s> spinrite from steve gibson </s>
<s> gt chkdsk is a little boy sent out to do a big man s job </s>
<s> actually it s an old man </s>
<s> it s been around since the boot from floppy days </s>
<s> someone mentioned the need to do a backup </s>
<s> i do this twice a year should do it more often and my irreplaceable files such as the pictures i ve taken are additionaly backed up onto a dvd and far away in my brother s safe </s>
<s> yes it s old but it s been updated for ntfs </s>
<s> and backups are nice but they can be nothing if you get bad copies </s>
<s> i ve had this happen with floppies tapes cds and dvds </s>
<s> i make 2 or 3 copies of data files and have not lost data </s>
<s> yet </s>
<s> but i have had to use all 3 copies to recover data some files </s>
<s> well lets start off with the basics </s>
<s> the hard drive is a thin mettallic layer of magnetic material </s>
<s> this magnetic material is divided into clusters pipes sectors and all that fun jazz </s>
<s> what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer namely the clusters </s>
<s> when chkdsk finds these errors on the platter the term for the hard drive it will attempt to fix these </s>
<s> it will not go through your files and fix them </s>
<s> this magnetic material is divided into clusters pipes sectors pipes </s>
<s> i don t think so </s>
<s> what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer again i don t think so </s>
<s> one thing it is looking for is quot lost clusters quot clusters that are marked as in use but they are not </s>
<s> another thing it is looking at is the quot indexes quot </s>
<s> i could go on but i won t </s>
