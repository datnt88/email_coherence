<s> i have a system that was gutted by a friend and i am wanting to turn it into a new desktop system for home </s>
<s> it was originally a server that they used with dual processors 2 amd 2ghz </s>
<s> like i said they gutted it and left only the motherboard processors case fans </s>
<s> i tried flipping it on to see if it was even worth messing with and after only 1 2 seconds the fans shut down and a led came on in the middle of the mobo signalling that it was overheating </s>
<s> i pulled the heat sinks off dual processors remember put new thermal grease between them and the processors and tried to start it up again no difference </s>
<s> it still shut down after 1 2 secs and the overheating light came on </s>
<s> i was going to buy ram hdd etc but if it won t make it more than 2 secs i figured it would need some more help </s>
<s> any suggestions or should this be retired </s>
<s> system specs not much right now </s>
<s> dual amd socket a processors 2 ghz amsn2400dkt3c mobo gigabyte ga 7dpxdw p 450w power supply 4 80 mm fans in case </s>
<s> your hsf s can t possibly be adequately coupled for heat transfer to the cpu s </s>
<s> you may have too much thermal grease on them however i suspect that the clamping system is fouled up </s>
<s> clamping the hsf s tight enough can be a very scary process </s>
<s> of course they may be totally inadequate hsf s </s>
<s> i assume while experimenting the case is off thus the general issue of cooling the total interior of the case is not a problem </s>
<s> are the fans running at top speed </s>
<s> if plugged into the mobo with three pin connectors they are temperature controlled maybe the controllers are bad </s>
<s> get adapters to run the fans at full 12 volts by connecting to the big molex connectore </s>
<s> they gave you the system with the cpus already present suggests they didn t have much luck with it either </s>
<s> i suppose the cpus themseleves are already buggered and may well be toast or at least one of them </s>
<s> overall if possible does that mtrbd </s>
<s> work with one cpu installed alone </s>
<s> if so test that way </s>
<s> otherwise verify correct amount of cpu grease and further that is clean before install if older thermal paste was used </s>
<s> thena pply new grease otherwise amds aren t very overtemp tolerant </s>
<s> remove cpus just to check the socket a s placement is glased or browned it shows alot of temp was active not a good sign </s>
<s> this excludes any other possiible cause mtrbd </s>
<s> or elsewhere </s>
<s> play with it is basically the best t s i can give but if the cpus are socket a type are they transferable to another single socket a mtrbd </s>
<s> if so then try that </s>
<s> the cpu p n is present on the top surface or the die or bottom </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
