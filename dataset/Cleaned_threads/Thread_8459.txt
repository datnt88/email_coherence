<s> i m home from college with my laptop apple powerbook sitting in my room without any internet </s>
<s> my brother one room over has road runner </s>
<s> i am confused as to what to buy if i want to share that internet connection with him wirelessly </s>
<s> do i get a router gateway or an access point </s>
<s> i m a little confused </s>
<s> should i just buy a cable modem wireless router all in one if i am planning on moving out anyway </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> offered here gt gt gt will do </s>
<s> adding a wireless adapter to the mac is all that s left </s>
<s> i don t know about having to add an adapter to most of the new laptops now a days unless i have been confused about this as well </s>
<s> for most of the new laptops if it says they have wireless airport technology apple or wireless centrino built in doesn t this mean that the notebooks are ready to go </s>
<s> for instance i know my powerbook has an 802 11 g and b capability built in </s>
<s> i don t need to buy a receiver along with the router and plug that into the notebook do i </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> get an access point with a router capability its a combo yes your laptop is already have a wireless adaptor built in </s>
<s> having a powerbook and wanting to go wireless i figured this would be a good device to go with </s>
<s> my question is this if my brother has a pc that is connected to his cable modem do i merely place the apple airport express in between his cable modem and pc and then reap the benefits of having internet in my room wirelessly </s>
<s> is it that simple </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> modem gt gt router gt gt pc in one port and your airport express in another port </s>
<s> you configure the airport express through an application a utility in your powerbook </s>
<s> remember to disable dhcp in the airport express let the router be the dhcp server </s>
<s> if i don t necessarily want to create a network but rather just want an internet connection can i just place a wireless router i have wireless capability in between my brothers cable modem and computer </s>
<s> my concern is if incorporating a router would mess with his internet connection </s>
<s> i assume i could do all this and then just set up the router on my computer </s>
<s> any input would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the wireless access point have be connected to the modem since the modem only have one port you need a router to be able to connect your brother pc and your wireless access point unless its a modem router combo modem gt gt router gt gt pc and wireless access point each connected to the router port </s>
