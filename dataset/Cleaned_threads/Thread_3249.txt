<s> i am running windows xp and my start menu as well as my drop down menus are periodically jittery </s>
<s> it comes and goes and sometimes changing desktop sizes and resolutions calms it down for short periods </s>
<s> there seems to be no rhyme or reason for it and i have tried all the conventional troubleshooting methods </s>
<s> sometimes the menus are so jittery that i cannot even read them </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> are you using a flat panel monitor or a crt monitor </s>
<s> do you happen to be using a heater flourescent light or some other electrical appliance right next to your monitor or computer </s>
<s> that can cause problems similar to what you describe as well </s>
<s> the problem only occurs when you have that device on </s>
<s> if you have a crt the refresh rate should be set to at least 72hz or you do get flicker which may be what you mean by jittery </s>
<s> you do this in advanced settings </s>
<s> the thing to try is a different monitor or your monitor on a different system to try and narrow down the cause </s>
<s> hello the monitor is a crt one and i have tried several refresh rates with it </s>
<s> it is now 80hz </s>
<s> it always settles down after i make a change but then starts acting up again </s>
<s> there are no other electrical devices near it </s>
<s> i have a surge protector but there are only computer related devices plugged into it </s>
<s> the only thing i haven t tried is moving my monitor to my other computer i will do that in the near future </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
