<s> i just got an hp pavilion a6157c desktop with vista premium home e4400 processor 2 0ghz 320 hard drive 2gb ram integrated intel 950 accelerator graphics quot card quot </s>
<s> i downgraded from hp a6077c w nvidia 7500le card because of monitor issues and keyboarding issues that kept being unresolved </s>
<s> i saved 300 but am now having trouble loading my yahoo browser email </s>
<s> i freeze </s>
<s> is this due to my graphics quot card quot chip is more appropriate </s>
<s> how do i resolve this </s>
<s> doesn t have an effect on that sounds like a connection issue maybe </s>
<s> what browser are you using </s>
<s> yahoo is the browser but i need to go through internet explorer to get to it </s>
<s> with vista i don t have a dedicated icon anymore like i did with xp why </s>
<s> i don t know </s>
<s> should i download a newer version of ie </s>
<s> i m running the latest 7x </s>
<s> it might not be vista compatable which might explain why it isn t working </s>
<s> if all you re wanting is the icon back just right click on the exe and create a shortcut and drag that onto your desktop </s>
<s> also i d generally suggest firefox or opera as web browsers </s>
<s> i never went through firefox </s>
<s> i generally use ie because most systems come equipped that way </s>
<s> is it better </s>
<s> how </s>
<s> where can i download it </s>
<s> c net </s>
<s> free </s>
<s> which was the basis for a supreme court case involving microsoft and the doj </s>
<s> firefox is entirely free cnet might have it on download com probably does </s>
<s> but also works </s>
<s> i m not sure what your actual problem is given that i don t understand your explanation of using the yahoo browser quot through quot internet explorer </s>
<s> if you mean the yahoo toolbar thats a different thing </s>
<s> i just want to say firefox has solved a lot of my browser issues </s>
<s> i was using the term quot browser quot wrong in the previous post sorry </s>
<s> i got rid of ie and downloaded the latest firefox imported my yahoo toolbar etc and wow </s>
<s> things are soooooooooooooo much faster </s>
<s> no hanging no freezing </s>
<s> amazing </s>
<s> i wish i knew about firefox before </s>
<s> even the typing issues i ve had in the past have gone away </s>
<s> i knew it had something to do with my homepage but i was assuming it was because of yahoo not ie </s>
<s> what makes firefox so superior to ie </s>
