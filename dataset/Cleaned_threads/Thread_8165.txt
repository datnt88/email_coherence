<s> in my house i have a few windows systems both vista and xp and a few macs </s>
<s> a few months back we bought an eyetv for the imac and use it to record tv shows </s>
<s> much to our surprise it also allows us to access digital and hd channels from our cable line no set top box </s>
<s> i d like to find a pc equivalent but unfortunately elgato the eyetv manufacturer does not make a pc version of the product </s>
<s> i want to do this because i would like to move my tv recording process to a home server and that is windows based </s>
<s> i d like to ask this community especially those with tv tuner experience for recommendations for a good pc tv tuner product that hopefully will give me everything that eyetv does on the mac </s>
<s> internal cards external usb dongles if you see one you like check newegg com and buy com for best pricing </s>
<s> other than the eyetv i don t really have a not of experience with these products </s>
<s> when i look over specs it s very confusing and not very enlightening in trying to determine quot which one quot </s>
<s> in particular i do want to be able to get digital channels even without a set top box or antenna like the eyetv does and especially to be prepared once the digital transition occurs soon </s>
<s> i was hoping to get a little more guidance than just finding a source for a list of products </s>
<s> hauppauage is the leading brand of tuners for the pc </s>
<s> all of the cards dongles can record atsc analog ntsc and qam signals </s>
<s> wintv hvr 1250 has a single analog digital tuner and uses your cpu to do the mpeg encoding </s>
<s> you can only watch what you re recording </s>
<s> wintv hvr 1600 has seperate analog digital tuners and an onboard mpeg encorder </s>
<s> it s a good choice for older pcs with less powerful cpus </s>
<s> wintv hvr 1800 is a revision of the hvr 1600 and includes fm radio </s>
<s> wintv hvr 2250 is the top of the line and has dual tuners so you can watch one program on your pc while recording another </s>
<s> it can also record 2 different programs simultaneously </s>
<s> if i connect the coax cable from the wall jack directly to my television i only get analog channels present world </s>
<s> if i add a set top box from my cable company i get the extra digital channels </s>
<s> if i connect that same coax to the eyetv i get the digital channels without the set top box </s>
<s> will the wintv hvr 2250 do that for me as well on the pc side </s>
<s> as ramark explained it incorporates a digital tuner </s>
<s> a set top box is basicly a digital tuner in a big box with it s own power supply with connections for an aerial and tv </s>
<s> any digital tuner can be used to watch or record gigital tv on a pc even a usb tuner the size not much bigger than a cigarette lighter </s>
<s> the wintv hvr 2250 is one of the best but there are other good tuners around if you want something cheaper </s>
<s> these cards will be able to plug into your cable outlet and give you all the functionality of the mac product analog and digital qam </s>
<s> you just need to figure out if you want dual tuners </s>
<s> unless you ve got a pc less than 2 years old with dual cores forget the first choice and get one of the middle choices </s>
<s> if you must watch a show and record a show get the 150 wintv hvr 2250 top of the line </s>
<s> if you re a tinkerer you can look into less expensive alternatives but hauppauge generally has the best support and broadest compatibilty </s>
<s> the other cards can be tricky to get working not difficult but not plug it in and it works </s>
<s> consider the pinnacle pctv hdtv dongles for a good 99 solution it works but some folks have a hard time getting it working </s>
<s> also keep in mind that vista xp media center can t handle qam you ll have to use the software that comes with the tuner or a third part product sage beyondtv etc </s>
<s> windows 7 has built in support for qam and will be very happy with any of the hauppauge cards </s>
