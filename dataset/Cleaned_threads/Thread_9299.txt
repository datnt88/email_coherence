<s> ive got an external hard drive that i use as a secondary storage </s>
<s> for some reason when i go to look for my music files and videos on my hard drive the files are hidden and not accessible </s>
<s> i have my options set to view hidden files but yet it still is not viewable </s>
<s> when i go to copy the contents from my desktop hard drive back to the external hard drive it tells me that the folder and files are already there </s>
<s> can anyone tell me why this is happening and how to fix it </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any all the help that can be provided </s>
<s> i am running xp home </s>
<s> 1 at i note another file browser that shows such without explorer s issues </s>
<s> 2 once you find the folder you might be able to rename it with gyula </s>
<s> 3 explorer windows can give us the wrong error message </s>
<s> for instance i ve seen the error message quot can t create folder xxyxx quot when there was no folder on the external drive </s>
<s> a little sleuthing and we found out the external drive was in a fat32 format which didn t support the directory or filenames in the directory </s>
<s> the error message was incorrect </s>
<s> go figure if that bug would ever be fixed </s>
<s> good luck bob </s>
<s> bob i checked my external hard drive and it is configured as ntfs </s>
<s> i also downloaded gyula and that didn t show the files </s>
<s> any other ideas </s>
<s> thanks for all of your help so far </s>
<s> we copy the files we need to save out then remove the partition and start over </s>
