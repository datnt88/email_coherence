<s> i have an old compaq presario 5102us with an amd 1ghz athlon 200mhz fsb 384 sdram 40gb hard drive and it s almost 5 years old </s>
<s> i recently bought a processor from ebay for it cause the one that it had before fried fan came loose and was separated from the cpu causing it to fry </s>
<s> i ve been trying to fix this pc for months but being in college and working i don t have a lot of time to try to fix it </s>
<s> yesterday i decided to take a look at it everything came on except for the monitor </s>
<s> i hooked up my hp a1010n s monitor an hp vs17 monitor and it didn t show any image either </s>
<s> it keeps telling me to quot check the video cable quot </s>
<s> i started playing with the cables and connectors thinking maybe i put them wrong when i put the new processor in a few months ago but that wasn t doing the trick </s>
<s> i also found a very small little black piece coming off the mother board near where the processor sits i took it out since it was loose anyway i also changed the cmos battery like it was suggested to me but that did not fix the problem </s>
<s> my question is is it the video card or the motherboard </s>
<s> does that little piece be the reason for the motherboard to be bad or could it be something else wrong with the motherboard </s>
<s> or is it the video card since the monitor will not come up but it does tell me to quot check video cable quot </s>
<s> which ever the problem is what do i do now </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> ylc </s>
<s> bob where are you </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but for this you need to have someone see the pc small pieces coming off doesn t sound good </s>
<s> if you have another functioning video card that you could put in the pc that could determine if its the card or the motherboard </s>
<s> a used pc parts store might do a free cheap diagnosis if you they have a replacement motherboard </s>
<s> the monitor would not come on and this black piece i m talking about is the size of a grain of rice </s>
<s> so i doubt this has a lot if anything to do with the fact that the monitor won t come on </s>
<s> i guess i could try the video card at a local shop if i can find someone to do it for free </s>
<s> what else could it be though </s>
<s> even when the rest of the system including the cpu isn t even on or the cpu is dead </s>
<s> hey ray so you think it s not the video card because the monitor displayed that message </s>
<s> i don t know what else to do </s>
<s> i know you ve offered for me to send it to you but i don t have the ways to send it and i don t trust how ups fedex treat their packages since i worked with ups i d know lol </s>
<s> i guess i ll have to find a local shop that is willing to check it out for me for free or something </s>
<s> if you can think of anything else let me know </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> that is definitely was not the video card </s>
<s> the history of that system and its performance after putting the new cpu in just bothers me </s>
<s> since i m the one that has to deal with it </s>
<s> p but anyays since i can t get any help here i ll take it to a shop i guess whenever i have money </s>
<s> thanks anyways </s>
