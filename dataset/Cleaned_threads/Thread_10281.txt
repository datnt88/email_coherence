<s> i have two 80 gb hard drives </s>
<s> i ve been thinking about using one just for my pictures gif s video and music </s>
<s> hoping that they would be safer on a seperate drive </s>
<s> is this idea valid or not and are there any other better ways to protect my files other than the fact that i must back up my files </s>
<s> i do use an antivirus program and firewall and don t download anything questionable </s>
<s> the most common reason for dataloss still remains the quot delete quot key </s>
<s> usually done in the small hours of the morning or due to a non booting pc which someone installs the os in hope of regaining access </s>
<s> go ahead but keep in mind that it s not a backup </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have four drives and 8 partitions between them one of which i partitioned about 9gb for c and i used my d drive to install all programs </s>
<s> another disk is partitioned for mp3s another for photos and another partitioned for downloads only </s>
<s> i named another drive partition quot resources quot and i keep copies of xp pro the entire cd and xp office and other data files from other computers etc </s>
<s> it is always a good idea to not use the entire c for the operating system and your programs because if it crashes then you are risking losing all your programs and data etc if you partition enough room for the root drive c and install programs etc on other drives partitions you will not lose as much </s>
