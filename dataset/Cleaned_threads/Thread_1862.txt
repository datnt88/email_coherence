<s> helo ok i currently have a modem that goes to a router with 2 phone jacks for my vonage phone service and lan 1 out also goes into computer </s>
<s> according to its setup disk my netgear wireless router wants to be the first router </s>
<s> i am afraid this will gum up my vonage signal </s>
<s> is it ok to have the wireless router first </s>
<s> anyone with vonage and a wireless router out there who can advise </s>
<s> thanks fj </s>
<s> if you re using a linksys router with the rt31p2 vonage adapter it will work fine </s>
<s> linksys publishes the procedure on their knowledge base id 358 i am using the same system with no problems essentially you quot cascade quot the routers change the router ip to 192 168 15 2 disable dhcp from your modem you connect to internet port of the rt31p2 connect quot ethernet 1 on the rt31p2 to your router i connected to quot 4 quot all this may sound confusing at least it does to me so your best bet is to check out the linksys knowledge base even ask their tech help via e mail that s what i did and they were most helpful </s>
<s> this system works great with no problems good luck </s>
<s> sorry i re read your question and notice that you are using a netgear router and my answer was referring to a linksys router </s>
<s> i don t think anything would be that much different you still quot cascade quot as i describe i would contact netgear and get their input </s>
<s> incidently my rt31p2 vonage router is the quot first quot one in line from the modem </s>
<s> sorry if i confused you with the linksys info </s>
<s> i was feeling kinda frustrated her and you have inspired me </s>
<s> altho it s been rough using the wizard for the wireless router it gets to a window that asks for admin password and i can t get past it </s>
<s> i will talk to linksys help tomorrow </s>
<s> thanks </s>
