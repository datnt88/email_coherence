<s> my computer has 2 optical drives dvd burner and dvd rom drive along with 2 sata drives </s>
<s> when i upgraded my video card to a nvidia 8800 the computer started shutting down intermittently </s>
<s> my power supply was around 350w at the time </s>
<s> so i hustled down to fry s and picked up a no name 500w ps that seem to handle the operation most of the time </s>
<s> to be truthful i did get a couple of shut downs over a period of 6 months or so </s>
<s> i almost never use the burner but yesterday i tried to use it and shortly after starting the burn the computer shut down </s>
<s> today i tried it again with the same results </s>
<s> once again i m thinking ps and perhaps trying one of the 600w 700w units out there </s>
<s> my first question is quot do you think a bigger ps will correct this problem quot my second question is quot what model number should i get quot while i would like to keep the cost down to under 50 75 i would rather spend more money for a dependable ps </s>
<s> i don t think my no name 500w really pulls that much power </s>
<s> any input on this matter would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> some get fixated on cpu temp but i just leave the cover off for the test run </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> here s the issue with psu is that not only supplying the power but at a stable level </s>
<s> some suppose that voltage rails are also at risk as they cen supply only so much for all given devices attached thus dual rails are mentioned </s>
<s> the main thrust of a good psu is brandname and stable output because it is a brandname dependable as it were </s>
<s> if you don t buy a brandname then buy the largest wattage generic psu to at least get lower wattage demands seemly supplied at stable level </s>
<s> your video card is very demanding and usually on the box it came in suggest you have at least 350w good psu to be usable </s>
<s> but as you see it does matter what psu you get </s>
<s> these brands are often mentioned antec enermax thermalake and coolmaster </s>
<s> but really sometimes a high wattage unit is a good start in 500w range </s>
<s> the absolute best are from pcpower cooling check their website </s>
<s> here s a help guide for selecting a psu last good great cooling helps maintain power levels as they do fluctuate under heat stress </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i tried that with no help </s>
<s> i think i may have stumbled across the solution while i had the cover off the case </s>
<s> my computer is plugged into a battery backup which always seemed to run fine </s>
<s> when we loss the power the backup gives me about 5 minutes to go through a normal shutdown </s>
<s> if i m not here it shuts down the computer normally a couple of minutes before the battery dies </s>
<s> instead of using the battery backup i plugged the computer directly into the household current </s>
<s> when i was plugged into the battery backup the computer would quot die quot after only getting about 2 into the burn process </s>
<s> plugged into the wall i m now over 10 of the way in the burn process and the computer is humming along so i m thinking the battery backup is not providing stable voltage when the computer is using most of it s hardware </s>
<s> i m also wondering if this is a common problem with battery backup systems </s>
<s> if the burn is successful i m going to have to consider getting a bigger battery backup and i do like that protection when running my system </s>
