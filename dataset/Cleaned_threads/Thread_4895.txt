<s> may be an odd question or may be not </s>
<s> just added a breakout box to my computer </s>
<s> headphone microphone and 2 usb plugs work fine </s>
<s> my problem is the firewire plug </s>
<s> the cable for it has connections for a header as did the others </s>
<s> my firewire card s internal connection is a plug </s>
<s> now to my question </s>
<s> are there firewire plugs available </s>
<s> the other choice would be to buy a firewire cable and cut the end off and graft it </s>
<s> this is also a problem </s>
<s> the header connections are labeled but i have no way to match those to the plug wires </s>
<s> if anyone can point me to a source for a 1394 plug and or a means of identification of wires i would greatly appreciate it </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> you need to give us exact brand name and model numbers of what you want to connect too many possibilities </s>
<s> actually jeff i did give the pertinent info with the exception of specifying it as 1394a </s>
<s> finding a male plug end isn t a good idea online </s>
<s> shipping would make it more expensive than it needs to be </s>
<s> finding the cheapest cable locally and cutting the plug off and splicing the wires seems the best bet </s>
<s> i ve found more info than i ll ever need except the simplest question </s>
<s> are all 6 pin 1394a exactly the same except for length </s>
<s> if i cut into any given cable am i going to find the same color wires going to the same contacts as any other plug on any other cable </s>
<s> since they adopted the 1394a 2000 protocol you could assume this is the case </s>
<s> but assumptions can kill equipment </s>
<s> different wire makers could figure internal structure wouldn t matter as long as the cable worked </s>
<s> i did hours of research and never found this issue addressed or diagramed </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> in short </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> to drive the cost to the lowest levels i can only guess what color wires you find inside may as well be all grey </s>
<s> answer </s>
<s> use an ohm meter to ring it out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> thats what i was leery about </s>
<s> one vender had a break down of their cables showing the same colors that was the best i could find </s>
<s> i ll be very very careful </s>
