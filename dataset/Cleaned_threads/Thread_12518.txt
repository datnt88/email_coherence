<s> hello have an older dell laptop </s>
<s> the monitor went dark smelled that characteristic toasted hardware smell coming from location near the power button top middle area and soon after shut itself down </s>
<s> when i reboot the screen lights up and after it boots fully the screen goes dark and it shuts down again after a few minutes </s>
<s> what could be the issue </s>
<s> there s nothing that can be done without taking it apart and probably not much buy the user anyway </s>
<s> you ll need to take it to a shop for a diagnosis and estimate </s>
<s> since you said it s an older dell i d say consider it gone </s>
<s> you may still be able to remove the hard drive put that in an external enclosure and retrieve you data </s>
<s> that toasted smell is really a harbringer of things to come </s>
<s> the priority here is your data </s>
<s> external enclosures are indeed easier to come by than opening everything up </s>
