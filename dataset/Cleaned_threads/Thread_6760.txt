<s> the situation i need to print to 640 printers on a single network </s>
<s> i need to add these printers to my computer and then print to them </s>
<s> the printing should be as simultaneous as possible </s>
<s> doing this by hand would obviously take forever so i am open to third party apps cheap vbscripts with instruction please command prompts or anything else that will work </s>
<s> i ve found programs to facilitate the quot printing quot part i really am looking for suggestions on the quot adding quot </s>
<s> all of the printers are tcp ip </s>
<s> any suggestions are greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you may be saving a small business </s>
<s> ws 10 aspx is where i would start as a programmer </s>
<s> do you have a programmer on your staff </s>
<s> nope i m practically alone </s>
<s> i have a part time assistant and there are the ladies in the media center that boot the computers for me in the morning </s>
<s> can you say budget cuts </s>
<s> other options </s>
<s> intelliscribe might be what you re looking for </s>
<s> not exactly cheap but for a small business it might be worth looking into </s>
<s> you could also try doing a search for quot broadcast printing quot for possible hits </s>
<s> intelliscribe is fine for distribution but its adding the printers to my machine that i m hung up on </s>
<s> thanks though </s>
<s> go with what you have </s>
<s> when faced with such limits and no staff i find the best course of action is to use what you know and have </s>
<s> i do know there are command line methods but these will only confuse most as not only it s the command line but the setup will be taxing </s>
