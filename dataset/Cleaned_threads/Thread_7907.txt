<s> to consider getting a good video card which means avoid ati s current offerings radeon x series models 300 850 lack sm3 0 and fp32 which means they lack features that are good to have and radeon x 1300 1800 draw a ton of power and cost a fortune as their just being launched nvidia s geforce 6800 and 7800 series are excellent choices for a processor i d consider amd s athlon64 1gb of dual channel ddr 400 a decent motherboard from dfi or msi good psu from antec enermax or ocz 200gb 400gb hard drive depending on what you want to store honestly 80gb is fine 2 80gb s is what i ve got and it s more than i need pcie is a good idea and beyond that i m gonna say windowsxp home edition or pro linux won t support as many games will require more work to get the few games it does support working i d say just go onto newegg com and look around arctic silver isn t required but it s a really good idea find a parts configuration that you think works post it back and i d be happy to comment and i m sure so would damasta </s>
