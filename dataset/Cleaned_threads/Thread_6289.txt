<s> my router has been working fine for the last couple of months but as of yesterday it has started to play up </s>
<s> my download speeds have dropped from around 350kb s to 7kb s </s>
<s> i havent changed removed any software nor is there any virus as i have done a scan using the free version of avg </s>
<s> also my router is still showing my connection to be 7680kb s so i am assuming my phone line is fine and i can still get high download speeds whilst using azureus for torrent downloads which confuses me even more </s>
<s> i tried to get help on the netgear forums but i got no replys </s>
<s> one point i must make is that as a last resort i reset my router settings lastnight and things seem to be more or less fine until i logged in again today to find that my download speeds was back down to around 7kb s </s>
<s> any help would be great </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s> remove the router from the mix </s>
<s> if the trouble persists you have two components left </s>
<s> change the pc and you re down to one </s>
<s> i had a similar problem last week and i think i fixed it </s>
<s> i changed the channel my network was operating on i believe the default is 11 </s>
<s> i went into the wireless configuration screen and changed it </s>
<s> after that it seemed to work fine again </s>
<s> i think a neighbour with a more powerful router might have been interfering with my signal </s>
<s> hope that solves the problem </s>
