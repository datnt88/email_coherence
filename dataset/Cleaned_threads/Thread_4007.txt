<s> hi all first i would like to thank you all for the help in the past </s>
<s> was so far very helpful </s>
<s> the problem i m sitting now with is that i m trying to split a ethernet cable </s>
<s> what i have so far is a switch set up and working 100 with 11 computers </s>
<s> now there is another pc comming in and i need another ethernet cable to that pc </s>
<s> but my problem is that i have to go through walls and other obstacles </s>
<s> i want to save some time and money on this so i thought of splitting the cable </s>
<s> what i have tried was one cable that i know is working </s>
<s> i took that point and plugged it in to a wallbox and then took 2 fly leads and punched them into that same wallbox </s>
<s> now when i connect the 2 fly leads comming out of the wallbox to the 2 pc s the light on the back of the cards goes on and off and the connection shows quot limited or no connectivity quot </s>
<s> this tells me that that method of splitting is not working </s>
<s> all i need to know is why not </s>
<s> i ll be putting in another switch and work it from there which i m busy with but i would like to find out why my trick didn t work out </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> but if you re trying to separate the pairs within an ethernet cable and run two digital signals through it that isn t going to work </s>
<s> sure only two of the 4 pairs are needed for data but that doesn t mean the other two pairs are just wasted </s>
<s> otherwise you d see transmit and receive pairs only </s>
<s> someone here might be able to explain why the unused pairs in the 8 wire system are required </s>
<s> perhaps it s hardware handshaking or some such </s>
<s> i really don t know but you need all 8 and not just 4 no splitting or cable y connectors or un twisting longer than necessary </s>
<s> never will work </s>
<s> each device is assigned a specific ip address </s>
<s> splitting the cable does two things </s>
<s> reduces the current power to the device and connects two devices where one is expected </s>
<s> it won t work </s>
<s> trick is correct </s>
<s> this trick won t work </s>
<s> look into 3com s intellijack systems these are basically small switching devices that fit into the wall and can split the signal that way </s>
<s> they can operate on off of an ac adapter or by using poe </s>
<s> thanks i had good time with this forum must say </s>
<s> and also worth a try as i hoped actually it will work cause i realy don t want to run that cable again </s>
<s> but i ve connected a small second hand 4port switch and that seems to help and i have space for another 2 cables to fit in case i need more </s>
<s> thanks for your time guys </s>
<s> i appreciate it a lot </s>
