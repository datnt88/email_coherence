<s> i have an old hp pavilion running xp </s>
<s> my initial problem is that i can t connect to any wireless networks without setting it up manually via the isp </s>
<s> obvs can t do that if it s a public one </s>
<s> i tried solving that but no luck and now i can t even see the list of wireless networks even though my wifi switch is on </s>
<s> i ve checked the drivers and it s intel 174 pro wireless 3945abg network connection which all seems to be on and functioning </s>
<s> i ve tried updating the driver via the intel website </s>
<s> having trouble with that too </s>
<s> can anyone help </s>
<s> is it possible to update this driver </s>
<s> can i install a brand new one </s>
<s> any other tips </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> by the way the driver is a 2006 version </s>
<s> for example there are two issues here </s>
<s> 1 xp </s>
<s> just last month we installed xp and sure enough it could not connect to our wireless lan </s>
<s> turns out xp could not work with our wpa2 wlan </s>
<s> there is no fix for this as it s not a driver issue </s>
<s> after we connected it with the ethernet lan and let it update to xp sp3 and got a new driver from the laptop s maker it was dated 2005 then the xp sp3 laptop could connect to our wlan </s>
<s> 2 can t see networks </s>
<s> now there is a common issue that if some took the outdated advice from say gt lt then you would have to enter the information manual which you did and then it works </s>
<s> so here we are with a long list of issues and since you can make it work with the manual entry i have to write that all is as expected </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the response </s>
<s> it didn t exactly help but it gave me ideas </s>
<s> however i solved it by doing a system restore to when it was working </s>
<s> and now it s all good </s>
<s> i still had the issue of the browser not connecting but after changing some firewall settings it s all good now </s>
