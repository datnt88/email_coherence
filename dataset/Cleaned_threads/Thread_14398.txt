<s> my xp home system just started telling me that it does not detect the hard drive on boot </s>
<s> i used revovery from the xp install cd and ran chkdsk p and chkdsk f and fixmbr and fixboot </s>
<s> it found errors with the chkdsk f but i thought it fixed them </s>
<s> still doesn t see drives on boot </s>
<s> bios setup doesn t see them either </s>
<s> my question is do i need a new hard drive to fix this or is it something else </s>
<s> replace the cable and or try it on another port </s>
<s> make sure it spins up </s>
<s> a poor power connector can cause this </s>
<s> if it does not show in the bios xp won t see it either so don t bother with xp until until the detection problem is worked out </s>
<s> help considerably if you gave us a complete rundown on your system </s>
<s> first thoughts are that the drive is probably ok but that you may have fallen victum to malware of one sort or another </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
<s> thanks for the info and here are the specs on the computer </s>
<s> i m running xp home installed with a clean install using an upgrade from 98se </s>
<s> it is up to date with sp2 and all of the latest udated from microsoft </s>
<s> it is a micron millenia best buy p 733 with 2 hard drives </s>
<s> i m running awil s avast anti virus and microsofts anti spyware </s>
<s> i just did a chkdsk on the secondary drive and it read unrecoverable </s>
<s> i unhooked it and the pc started </s>
<s> guess i m back in business </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> thanks for the input </s>
<s> while checking the cable i decided to check the secondary drive </s>
<s> it reads unrecoverable with chkdsk so i unplugged it and now the pc boots </s>
