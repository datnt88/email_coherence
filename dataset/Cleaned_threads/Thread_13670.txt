<s> hi i m trying to help my roommate with his computer but i need some help figuring out what s wrong with it </s>
<s> i don t know all the specs but it s got a p4 and has been working acceptably up until now </s>
<s> this morning he tried to turn it on and it wouldn t boot </s>
<s> i ve opened it up and a green led on the mobo is lit whenever the computer is plugged in which makes me wonder if the psu is ok when i try to turn on the computer the cpu s heatsink fan spins for a second and then stops which also seems to indicate that it s getting power </s>
<s> the psu fan does the same thing spins for a second and then stops </s>
<s> if i hit the power button after that nothing happens </s>
<s> if i unplug the computer for a few seconds the led will go out and when i plug it back in and hit the power button the fans will again spin for a second and then stop </s>
<s> the fact that at least some juice seems to be flowing makes me wonder if the mobo not the psu is the problem </s>
<s> any advice would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> jason </s>
<s> ok this is really weird it occurred to me that the power cord might be faulty so i replaced it with one of my power cords and it booted up fine </s>
<s> i unplugged it put the old cord back and now it s working fine again </s>
<s> what in the world does this mean </s>
<s> it happened again the fans will spin when the power button is pressed but it won t start </s>
<s> is there any way to figure out what the problem is without buying a new psu to try out </s>
<s> i could really use some help with this </s>
<s> psus fail in all different ways </s>
<s> some go snap crackle and pop some die a slow stuttering death </s>
<s> the first step is to swap it out and see if the problem disappears </s>
<s> i m having a similar problem system starts to power up and then shuts itself off after 2 or 3 seconds </s>
<s> i have tried using a psu from another case and still no joy </s>
<s> could this be a bad connection or a bad cooling fan for the cpu or something else that i can check </s>
<s> thanks </s>
