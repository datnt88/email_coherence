<s> i have two pc s in two seperate locations of the same town one pc in my office and the other pc at my home </s>
<s> i want to be able to connect to my office printer from my home pc both machines use winxp and have broadband internet connections </s>
<s> i do not have any servers ie print servers or software for such services </s>
<s> the printer is an epson stylus photo r300 </s>
<s> is it possible to connect my home pc to my office printer without a print server over the internet whilst the office is closed unmanned i realise i would have to leave the office computer printer in a powered on state </s>
<s> if it is possible how would i do this </s>
<s> windows only offers support for printers in a local area network not between peers across the internet i m afraid </s>
<s> even if there was you wouldn t be able to get the results the prints without visiting the office of course so realistically speaking only the next day </s>
<s> and if you run out of paper it stops printing </s>
<s> i think it s best to buy a second printer for home use </s>
<s> the main cost of printing is the ink and for that it makes no difference where you print </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks for your assistance </s>
