<s> three main questions </s>
<s> 1 i m upgrading some peripherals drives ram hd how can i know how much power my system requires now and how much it will after the upgrades </s>
<s> 2 i m limited very in my cpu upgrade </s>
<s> i have a p4 1 4ghz and specs allow for 1 8 i came across some kits that state they can upgrade to higher processors 2 8 with the use of an adapter </s>
<s> what are the benefits problems of using such kits </s>
<s> 3 finally again regarding my cpu which is supposed to have a 400hz bus </s>
<s> i recently ran a utility test and the results were that it was running at 100 what can cause this difference </s>
<s> if anyone can help with any of these i d appreciate it </s>
<s> to run at 400 mhz fsb you need ddrsdram ddr 200 </s>
<s> are you sure what the 100 mhz report really means </s>
<s> the ddr 200 is actually 100 mhz memory that gets double clocked </s>
<s> 200 then gets quad clocked as the fsb from the mch to the cpu 400 </s>
<s> then of course the multiplier in the cpu multiplies that up to run the cpu at its rated speed </s>
<s> what speed is the cpu reporting </s>
<s> if you were not actually acheiving the 400 mhz fsb the cpu would be running less than 1 4 ghz </s>
<s> i don t think that ddr came any less than 100 mhz so think that it simply the reporting scheme being confusing </s>
<s> now there were some mobos that would take either sdram or ddrsdram different physical sockets and could not be mixed </s>
<s> if perchance you are running with pc 100 sdram that would actually be only 100 mhz </s>
<s> many bioses will give the basic memory speed 100 mhz in this case as the setting to get the 400 mhz fsb </s>
<s> it varies by mobo bioses </s>
<s> do you have the manual </s>
<s> i guess i should ve included this but i m running pc800 rdram in my system </s>
<s> because it was a custom order they left out several of the hardware manuals </s>
<s> it s now that i m upgrading some things that i ve been looking into the specifics </s>
<s> and your responce gave me an idea so i found a new tool that showed my speed back at 400 the one that was giving me 100 was from compaq s hp site </s>
<s> i contacted them as well and by their lack of information and knowledge in their responce i think that their tool was more of a basic preconfigured automated responce for standard prebuilt units which carry the regular ram like you mentioned </s>
<s> since mine was custom it didn t fit the profile that was given </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i agree with the other replys that your reported 100mhz buss speed is not something to worry about </s>
<s> it is a multiple of 400 and 800 so you are probably doing just fine </s>
<s> it does get doubled then quad pumped to the memory buss on most motherboards </s>
<s> on the cpu upgrade make sure you have enough power supply 350 watt will be good </s>
<s> 400 watt is even better if you want to overclock </s>
<s> the newer processor will generate more heat so be sure you have a good cooling fan and a well vented case </s>
<s> additional case fans are good if you have the space to add them </s>
<s> they are cheap insurance against component failure </s>
<s> no advice on the cpu adapter kits use caution </s>
