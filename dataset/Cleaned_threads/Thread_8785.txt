<s> i m having some problems with my system that i suspect may be related to my power supply </s>
<s> the power supply itself seems to be in its last days </s>
<s> when i start the pc up an electrical noise is noticeable coming from the supply </s>
<s> plus the computer is increasingly witnessing a repeated problem </s>
<s> what happens is the screen will suddenly turn off and go into the power saving state because the graphics card stops sending a signal to the monitor then immediately comes back on and the picture is all scrambled and the computer becomes unresponsive all together </s>
<s> i don t believe it is the card itself because if music or such is playing when it happens the sound will also cut off so i think the entire system freezes </s>
<s> i also am unable to overclock the motherboard even a little bit since the system locks up after a minute or two after it boots </s>
<s> this also points to a power problem </s>
<s> so is it actually a power problem or is it sometime else i may be overlooking </s>
<s> pc specks amd athlon 64 3500 geforce 6800 gt windows xp professional 1 gb ddr ram 2 120mm fans 200 gb seagate sata hard drive 450w power supply </s>
<s> the oc ing limit is probably the biggest indication </s>
<s> ummm yeah i d say it s your psu </s>
<s> what brand is it </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> since this seems to be a newer pc at least from the processor stand point amd64 how old is the psu </s>
<s> with your symptoms the first thing i would do is swap out the psu </s>
<s> a good 450w supply should handle your pc </s>
<s> but 35 450w psu may not </s>
