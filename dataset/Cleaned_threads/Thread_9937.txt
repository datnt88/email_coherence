<s> ideas dimension inspiron help me please </s>
<s> i would not recommend a dell because of lack of customer support </s>
<s> tech support is based in india </s>
<s> don t get me wrong they build good systems </s>
<s> they are not necessarily best value for the money </s>
<s> personally i would shop around </s>
<s> quot the new dimension xps gen4 xps case is the most expandable dimension chassis offered </s>
<s> it supports up to three 400gb hard drives two pci express slots and three 5 25 inch drive bays for the highest levels of scalability with a cooling design that runs quietly quot </s>
<s> prices currently starting at 1 999 ships 1 20 2005 here is a link for the xps </s>
<s> i have to agree with rwils51 and say don t get a dell </s>
<s> you ll be sorry </s>
<s> dell used to be good probably had some of the best tech support out there </s>
<s> that was then </s>
<s> the machines seem to be well built but i ve noticed the quality go down over the years </s>
<s> we have 3 dell s all dimensions a 8400 4400 2300 like rwils51 says dell s tech support is now based in india not that it s what makes them bad but they lack the knowledge that the old tech support had </s>
<s> the people in india are book readers when they can t find your issue they tell you to quot reformat the hard drive quot the supervisors are no better either </s>
<s> then you can t understand what they re saying most of the time and they can t understand you </s>
<s> within a month i was sent a new hd for the 8400 and it took about 10 months for the 4400 s hd to go south </s>
<s> at 1st the tech support was in texas i believe they were very knowledgable people then it became half half between the us india </s>
<s> the tech s in the us weren t aware of being replaced either </s>
<s> when i mentioned i talked to some guy in india the one tech freaked </s>
<s> i have since become a god when it comes to reformatting the hd </s>
<s> have a local place build you a machine you ll be much happier </s>
<s> oh then there s the issue of compatibility of extras you might want to install </s>
<s> i just found that out as i now have a dvd paperweight </s>
