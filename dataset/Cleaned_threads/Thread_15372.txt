<s> i have just got a new hp pavilion 1130n computer and i have a linksys wusb11 wireless bridge and it keeps disconnecting but i need one for games guild wars battlefeild 2 i keep getting problems with you connection any recommendations </s>
<s> and is the wet11 any good </s>
<s> linksys </s>
<s> i might hardwire the pc to the router </s>
<s> wireless especially 802 11b devices does not provide enough throughput that gamers crave </s>
<s> you seem to be going from the pavilion which has a 100baset nic to a wireless bridge </s>
<s> but then to what another system a router modem or whatever and what is its potential speed </s>
<s> as michael said gaming requires fast throughput and the speed is limited to the slowest device </s>
<s> your computer is capable of 100 mbps </s>
<s> your current bridge and the wet11 you asked about are both 802 11b devices and are limited to 11mbps maximum </s>
<s> if the device on the other end of the wireless is also 802 11b no change is apt to help much </s>
<s> the newer 802 11g standard provides up to 54 mbps transmission and the forthcoming 802 11n standard will provide for up to 108 mbps rates </s>
<s> in the interim manufacturers are offering quot super g quot or quot pre n quot devices supporting the faster speed </s>
<s> however there is no guarantee they will meet the 802 11n standard when it is finalized </s>
<s> wireless throughput is also a function of distance </s>
<s> if you want to be assured of the highest speed and if it is possible use a cat5 cable as michael suggested rather than wireless </s>
<s> if wireless is required upgrade your bridge and whatever other devices are involved to at least the 802 11g standard </s>
<s> hope this helps frank </s>
<s> in real world testing </s>
<s> consumer base wireless is a lot less than its spec </s>
<s> i ve tested some linksys and netgear wireless routers </s>
<s> 802 11b mode goes anywhere between 3 6mbps and 802 11g mode goes anywhere between 7 9mbps </s>
<s> the quot rest quot of the bandwidth are overhead for wireless transmission </s>
<s> 100mbps switch goes around 80mbps with overhead </s>
