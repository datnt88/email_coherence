<s> i recently got a new power supply for my dell dimension 8100 and now i can t turn my computer on </s>
<s> the on off button flashes orange when power is going to the computer and when i touch it nothing happens </s>
<s> i know power is getting to the motherboard so i think the power supply is fine </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> check ur connections </s>
<s> must not have plugged in the psu to something maybe hard drive cpu fan etc </s>
<s> make sure everything has power and its connected securely </s>
<s> it would also help if u mention the make of the new psu </s>
<s> if this is a dell from 96 to 2000 they used a different power supply and mobo and if they were not hooked up just right they got fried </s>
<s> i hope this didnt happen to you </s>
<s> they werent interchangeable with industry standard stuff </s>
<s> finally started using the standard atx wiring </s>
<s> at least i hope so for the sake of this gentleman </s>
<s> he has to check with dell </s>
<s> the reverse could also have happened if he bought a supply for an older dell model that is not wired to the atx standard </s>
<s> a standard atx connected to the older dell s definitely zapped the mobo </s>
<s> thanks guys ill check the connectinos and whatnot </s>
<s> one thing though the light on the motherboard turns on when power is going to it does that mean it is not fried </s>
