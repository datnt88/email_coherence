<s> i recently bought a emachines and was thinking of upgrading the graphics to the x700 pro when you install the graphics card do you have to disable the onboard graphics first and i was also wondering if i would notice a difference in upgrading the memory to 1gb right now it only has 512mb </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you can do this either in hardware manager or in the bios </s>
<s> your machine should then use a generic display until you install the new card </s>
<s> also since 128 mb is dedicated to onboard graphics on the t6212 disabling it will free up the memory so right away you ll have 512 mb </s>
<s> if you do add memory don t make the mistake i made and do the following 1 check emachines website for recommended memory they recommend crucial kingston geil and a few others and 2 make sure to buy the memory in pairs </s>
<s> the mistake i made with the t6212 was buying a 1 gb stick </s>
<s> the memory only registered as 1 25 gb instead of the expected 1 5 gb </s>
<s> the documentation tells you this but who ever reads that stuff </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> 6600gt is rated better than x700 pro </s>
<s> this is fyi </s>
<s> but if u have already done the comparison and decided to go with ati have fun </s>
