<s> hello all i am having a problem installing this linksys wireless adapter wusb100 first off i have this old hp 750n using xp that i am hooking up to my tv in my loft </s>
<s> my router is a linksys wrt320n connected to my dell xps420 using vista ultimate with no problems </s>
<s> every time i try to set this adapter up it shuts the pc down or has a hardware installation error come up saying that the adapter hasn t passed windows logo testing to verify it s compatibility with windows xp </s>
<s> the hp passes all of the requirements for this to work and is fully updated </s>
<s> the box says this adapter is good for vista xp or even windows 2000 does anyone have any ideas on what the problem is if you need additional information i am more that willing to give it any help will be greatly appreciated thanks flu </s>
<s> run the installation cd first </s>
<s> i think the drivers have to be on the system before you plug in the card </s>
<s> if you must have products that pass this then for this device you must return it now as many makers do not bother with windows logo testing </s>
<s> there are fees and more to be paid to get that testing done </s>
<s> try another product </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ran the cd first and everything seems fine until i get to the part to put the adapter in that s when everything bad starts to happen thanks for the reply any other suggestions </s>
<s> flu </s>
<s> your adapter may be doa out of the box </s>
<s> take it back and get another brand </s>
