<s> i just got a new computer and my roommate has another computer </s>
<s> i had to set the new computer up last night when i go to my network to manage it the network is in my roommates name now and it says i have not been invited to manage the network </s>
<s> how does he do that </s>
<s> i have hp vista he has a dell xp </s>
<s> we both are using mcafee and that program is telling me i have to get his permission </s>
<s> i do not know how the network is in his name now and why i have to be invited to manage it </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> if all you have are two pcs connected it s likely just peer to peer and there is no network manager </s>
<s> you will have administrative and possibly limited accounts on the individual computers and perhaps some sharing of folder and or printers between the two </s>
<s> if you set up your own computer you likely used an administrator account </s>
<s> but you cannot access your roommate s pc without some additional configuration </s>
<s> i can only imagine the mcafee message might be from trying to do a network scan rather than files folders on your own pc </s>
<s> thanks for your advice </s>
<s> it is really confusing because my hp network sharing center has the network in my name and the mcafee has it in his name </s>
<s> i also wanted to ask this the network is stating it is public </s>
<s> should i make it private or keep it public </s>
<s> it is only me and his laptop a desktop and the printer we share and a roku device </s>
<s> and i am not going to starbucks any time soon to use my computer </s>
<s> the network will be the collection of attached hardware wired or wireless and quot the mcafee quot will be a piece of software that resides on one or more pcs </s>
<s> if your roommate installed a piece of software such as a mcafee product on your pc using an account other than yours and didn t make it accessible by all users this could be your problem </s>
<s> is this what you are seeing </s>
<s> actually the mcafee comes with my att dsl so i really am trying to figure out how it is showing it is his network if the mcafee was downloaded under my account </s>
<s> he is a sub account </s>
<s> then whoever pays the bill for the dsl owns that account </s>
<s> if your roommates username password was used to access the download site that could be related to the problem </s>
<s> if you pay the bill that s a different matter </s>
<s> this is beginning to sound like an issue you ll need to take up with your isp if it s just related to software they offer with a subscription to their service </s>
<s> sorry can t help in that regard </s>
<s> it sounds as if your problem is with the mcafee program that s offered with an at t account </s>
<s> i can t know but perhaps it s an add in to their own browser </s>
<s> if it s causing you more problems than it s value to you i d suggest removing it and getting another free av program </s>
<s> some av and internet security software if installed using its defaults is quite intrusive </s>
<s> there should be no reason it should interfere with local network management by pc owners </s>
<s> perhaps you re just dealing with a firewall that you don t have adequate privileges to take down </s>
<s> you need a firewall and an av program </s>
<s> i presume you have a router </s>
<s> that offers some protection from peering eyes </s>
<s> you might do well to consider using avast or free avg instead of mcafee </s>
<s> i pay the bill and it is in my name </s>
<s> i am going to call them tomorrow and ask what the heck is going on </s>
<s> i have a feeling though that at t is going to send me the 2nd level internet support that i have to pay for which i refuse to do </s>
<s> they send me there just to configure my email for my browser </s>
<s> thanks for your responses </s>
<s> oh another thing should i have my network set at public or private </s>
<s> the vista help files on the subject to see what scenario fits your needs </s>
<s> from the little i know the terms seem to be backwards </s>
<s> if you want to share on the local network it s private </s>
<s> if no sharing it s public at least that s what i ve read </s>
<s> it makes no sense to me either </s>
<s> i want to thanks everyone for helping </s>
<s> i think we are going to both uninstall the mcafee </s>
<s> it really is very intrusive </s>
<s> it looks like every time one of us gets a update we lose the internet connection </s>
<s> the network is fine though </s>
<s> very strange </s>
