<s> this past monday my house suffered severe smoke damage from a fire with the third floor getting most of the damage </s>
<s> my sony vaio which is my main computer and was bought 3 months ago was on the first floor and i need to access it for information </s>
<s> in addition i had to two other usable computers on the third floor </s>
<s> what do i need to do in order to clean all 3 pcs up so that they can be accessed and or used again </s>
<s> i know soot is a conductor for electricity and i don t want to short any of them out </s>
<s> in addition i do not have the money to take them anywhere to get any diagnostics done either </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> same thing here in 2001 smoke is very acidic besides the carbon being a conductor </s>
<s> i lost a pc scanner monitor and printer to smoke and heat no direct fire </s>
<s> the acidic nature of the smoke will cause extreme corrosion on all connections </s>
<s> but i was able to salvage my hd </s>
<s> hds are sealed against most problems </s>
<s> you may be able to salvage the hd if you can put it into another pc as a slave drive and recover data </s>
<s> but the other parts will be lost </s>
<s> my insurance replaced the pc and peripherals and i was able to put the old hd into the new one and recover my important stuff </s>
<s> good luck give a person a fish and you feed them for a day teach that person to use the internet and they won t bother you for weeks </s>
<s> click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about telephones internet connections and data and download free software </s>
<s> if the systems have only soot or smoke damage the hds themselves are pretty robust as they re sealed against the outside world </s>
<s> get a working system with some type of back up install the hds as a 2nd hd </s>
<s> the working system should contain the same os for ease of use and retrieve the data that way </s>
<s> however extreme heat is a bad thing is so found you have slim chance on your own decide on a professional service or not </s>
<s> to clean the system themselves to need to blow them out quot easily quot not a super charged blower as that can cause ionized charge to develope </s>
<s> use a hand blower like those found at camera shops </s>
<s> with disassembled system immerse the mtrbd </s>
<s> with any removable chips ram cpu and bios use esd care and wash in denatured alcohol or 90 rubbing alcohol </s>
<s> do not use a true solvent for cleaning </s>
<s> blow dry abit and allow to air dry </s>
<s> pitch the power supply unless you want to take a chance </s>
<s> the fd should be pitched as well </s>
<s> the kybd monitor etc </s>
<s> is an eyeball thing check but if in thought pitch them </s>
<s> a short or something along those lines will be more costly than a simple replacement </s>
<s> i repeat take the hds out and use a known good system to retrieve data to back up that data </s>
<s> once data is safe you can then rebuild the old systems </s>
<s> if this is too much to do then what is your data worth </s>
<s> no short cuts tada willy </s>
