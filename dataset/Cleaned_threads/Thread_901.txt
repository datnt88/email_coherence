<s> hey all i am going to purchase this machine very soon waiting on tax refund i understand it come with 512mb ddr400 pc3200 dimm 2x256mb sticks and it has 4 memory slots total </s>
<s> so i want to leave the 2 256 modules in place and add 2 512mb ddr333 pc2700 dimm modules </s>
<s> i want to use the pc2700 or ddr333 i bielve these are the same because i have one 512mb ddr333 pc2700 dimm already and then i would only need to purchase 1 more since you have to have memory modules installed in pairs i understand </s>
<s> i have read on the motherboards website it accepts ddr333 pc2700 by the way </s>
<s> you will notice i am trying to run different clock frequency memory modules simultanously </s>
<s> do you think there would be much conflict </s>
<s> in my experience it would not be a problem as the ddr400 pc3200 should clock to the lower demoninator which would be the 512mb ddr333 pc2700 dimm </s>
<s> lastly about memory </s>
<s> it s not an issue that all the modules are not of the same capacity is it </s>
<s> like i don t need all 512 s or all 256 s or all 1gb modules right </s>
<s> it never has been for any other pc i have had but want to make sure </s>
<s> thanks for reading this far by the way </s>
<s> that would give me 1 5gb memory running 333mhz </s>
<s> i don t honestly think the frequency difference from 333mhz to 400mhz is going to be noticable </s>
<s> do you </s>
<s> i will also add a x700 pro pci e video card </s>
<s> which will free up the 128mb shared memory and rock my gaming world i believe lol </s>
<s> i am unsure about a sound card </s>
<s> i will most likely hook it up as is and decide from there it s not that important to me </s>
<s> i see best buy has a 19 quot crt flat screen monitor in their ad this week for 129 99 then 30 rebate for 99 99 tax </s>
<s> it s their own brand name insignia </s>
<s> i have read so prolly only average performance but still 19 quot </s>
<s> i will add this also thanks very much for reading and responding p </s>
<s> i think ure referring to the t6212 </s>
<s> the ram it uses is ddr400 pc3200 although it is compatible with ddr333 pc2700 </s>
<s> i m not sure whether dat is possible to run it different speeds </s>
<s> i would rather by the same speed ones at 400mhz </s>
<s> what is the price difference </s>
<s> is it so much dat ure not willing to fork over the dough </s>
<s> also i would not go with the x700 pro as it suks compared to the 6600gt </s>
<s> at newegg evga 6600 gt is 160 </s>
<s> hey sorry ya t6212 for sure thanks for clarify </s>
<s> well i have 1 stick of 512mb ddr333 pc2700 already in the pc i am using now and wanted to use it so i would only have to buy 1 i guess i will give it a shot and see what happens </s>
<s> it s not like it would damage anything and if it runs great then what the heck lol </s>
<s> on to the x700 vs 6600gt </s>
<s> i have read some reviews and they seem to be very close in comparison but i have read about people with similar machines to t6212 with ati strucures built in to the motherboards that have said they get better graphics from the x700 </s>
<s> the reason for my choice btw </s>
<s> maybe that s not so </s>
<s> could you point me to a place where i can read more up on the two vs each other </s>
<s> thanks </s>
