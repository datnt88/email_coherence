<s> chipset intel 848p ich5 i have a bisic components in my machine gforce 5200 series from biostar 2x256 ddram 400mb </s>
<s> intel pentium 4 processor 3 0ghz 2 drives one is sata which has my operating system and the other one is parralel ide connection </s>
<s> my question is this </s>
<s> i can t seem to hardware components in pci slots </s>
<s> if i do so for example sound card 24 bit creative the pnp dects it as simple pci connection and then i look and instead of giving me the name of creative whic phisically i added it it give generic 56 sound plaster and question marks </s>
<s> it really acted funny </s>
<s> it did to all my pci components </s>
<s> i even check the cmos setup and altered it and no use no only that but also i formated my hard drvie and re installed xp but no to avail </s>
<s> what could be the problem </s>
<s> this sounds as if the drivers for your hardware aren t installed </s>
<s> you should have a driver cd that came with your motherboard or computer </s>
<s> place it in the cd drive and install the drivers </s>
<s> you may have to reboot the computer and let windows install each device </s>
<s> almost all addin cards are back to the old ways of install drivers </s>
<s> some require as stan noted that the motherboard drivers or bios be current as well </s>
<s> microsoft will not do this for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> plug n play this means that the mb bios will auto assign the irq and dma settings </s>
<s> a plug n play os like xp will try to find the drivers if it can then your ok if it can t it may put in it s closest guess which will probably not work </s>
<s> so for video and sound cards you allwise have to install the correct drivers </s>
