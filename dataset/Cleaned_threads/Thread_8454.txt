<s> hi recently my friend is looking for a good computer that would be good for gaming his price range is 350 any ideas </s>
<s> done </s>
<s> gaming is a sure thing </s>
<s> for the computer they could get a free old one from freecycle or the free area of craiglist and that will do the rest </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> typically prices for gamer pc s aren t cheap or within that 350 range </s>
<s> you can buy a pc in the usa when on sale or quot entry level quot models that are in 350 excludes taxes and or any s h but a decent price should start in the 500 or more </s>
<s> it still depends on what is put into the pc as well because better named devices or performance to include gpu psu and or extra cooling etc </s>
<s> not to mention the case as well would push pricing up </s>
<s> so let s be realistic in finding a gaming pc would demand better funds to spend </s>
<s> i exclude the availability of any used parts or carry over parts to a newer pc that one can build </s>
<s> also the os for now is generally when a retail versions is in the 100 range as an added expense if not carried over from old pc in legitimate fashion </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> example at a lot of kids make do with very little pc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> are you willing to build one </s>
<s> if so i advise looking at this sorry for the pcpartpicker link its the easiest site to do this </s>
