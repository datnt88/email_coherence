<s> i m looking to purchase one of these models and wonder if anyone can compare the performance of the sx2800 07 with the intel core 2 quad q8300 processor and 4gb ram against the sx2840 01 with the intel core i3 530 processor and 6gb ram </s>
<s> any comments would be appreciated </s>
<s> the core 2 quad runs 4 actual threads and the i3 runs 2 with hyperthreading </s>
<s> the i3 also has graphics on the cpu </s>
<s> while i don t have personal experience with either of these as mine are different i think you d want to look at your personal needs </s>
<s> if you want to game you want your own graphics card and not the i3 </s>
<s> if you like to open multiple programs you want more actual threads </s>
<s> shows vtx not to be a solid yes </s>
<s> i won t detail what this cpu feature is but it is growing in importance to many </s>
<s> shows a solid yes to vtx and given the higher clock rate i could safely bet that for almost every use this would outperform the older q8300 </s>
<s> but if you could get the old gear for cheap it s still a great choice if the price is right </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the comments </s>
<s> i m not into intensive gaming </s>
<s> i m leaning towards the i3 530 machine because of more memory newer chip architecture and a larger hard drive </s>
<s> cost of 2 machines is comparable </s>
