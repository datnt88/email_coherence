<s> im purchasing a hp a6230n computer 2 8 dual core 3 gig ram 400 hd going to upgrade the graphics card and the one im thinking about is the 8600 gt oc </s>
<s> specs looked good but i want to know how this card will hold up to todays games toms hardware s tier talked about the 8600 gt but not the oc version so i was wondering if anyone here knew about it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> from memory it wrote that within the same family you might see about 5 percent change in the scores </s>
<s> it s a fine card but i d still pick from the quot best video card for the money quot any day of the week </s>
<s> read in closing no gamer i know of is happy with today s cards </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so is it worth an extra 80 for the x1950 pro which is direct x 9 0 over the 8600 gt oc direct x 10 </s>
<s> and benchmarks </s>
<s> this is the only way i ll choose one card over another </s>
