<s> in another post sorry i forget where someone said that is was not a good idea to use packet writing </s>
<s> i rely on directcd for backing up critical files to cd </s>
<s> it has always been quirky and i often have trouble reading the disks on other computers but i have finally gotten it to work smoothly on the two computers that are most important to me home and work </s>
<s> am i making a mistake here </s>
<s> what is the best way to back up to cd </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the long thread covered many aspects of what is udf or packet writing </s>
<s> for some it s less than reliable </s>
<s> and if it is reliable all i have ever needed to do is to wait for it to eventually hiccup for those that never had an issue </s>
<s> which is why i simply erase a cdrw now dvdrw record what i want and treat it like a cdr or dvdr bob </s>
<s> why do you say quot not a dvdrw quot </s>
<s> i am planning to buy a new notebook soon and hope to use the dvdrw for storage </s>
<s> is this a bad idea </s>
<s> but not with any incd directcd package </s>
<s> i don t trust it </s>
<s> this is not to write it doesn t work but in my experience it works about 99 9 of the time </s>
<s> which is not good enough </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so how do you use your dvdrw </s>
<s> for critical backups my critical office files do you think this is your best option on a daily basis </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i collect my backup in a directory erase the dvdrw then record my files to it </s>

<s> and you find that they are reliably read on other computers </s>
<s> what software are you using </s>
<s> quot and you find that they are reliably read on other computers </s>
<s> what software are you using quot you didn t write about use with other computers </s>
<s> that issue pans incd directcd and is its biggest weakness </s>
<s> when i use the simple erase and record as if it s a cdr or dvdr then most other machines see if as i need it to be </s>
<s> that s a new question about compatibility issues with incd directcd </s>
<s> the answer is that you get to test for such </s>
<s> i don t have to test since i do not use incd directcd or such </s>
<s> today i use nero cdburnerxp roxio easy cd and k3b to create my cd and dvds </s>
<s> for video work i have other titles i use but that was not the topic </s>
