<s> wanted to see if one could virtualize a small email server to a usb drive of sufficient capacity </s>
<s> looking for powered usb drive if one exists and perhaps someone who has actually done this </s>
<s> much thanks in advance for an informed opinion </s>
<s> i missed it </s>
<s> what did you want to do exactly </s>
<s> linux and mail servers running happily off those spiffy 20 buck 8gb usb drives on some old pc but maybe you want a pc on an usb stick </s>

<s> much thanks for your timely reply </s>
<s> with the advance of virtualization i just thought it might be possible to virtualize applications to a usb drive </s>
<s> the two obvious barriers would be power and a physical connection to a router </s>
<s> just wondering if there is anything like this in existence or being ontemplated </s>
<s> ideally i would would like to access some things without having a desktop on 24 7 </s>
<s> let s just say that virtualization still requires a cpu and all the rest of the system </s>
<s> maybe you were asking for a full computer on some usb stick but i couldn t tell </s>
