<s> my old hp pavilion dv9207us stopped working and i purchase a new hp pavilion dv3 2155mx notebook </s>
<s> the old computer will not start up </s>
<s> i pulled out the external hard drive western wd 1200bevs sata 2 5 quot and purchased a thermaltake blacx docking station p n st0005u to transfer data onto my new notebook </s>
<s> it says it should easily transfer sata 2 5 quot and 3 5 quot hard drives </s>
<s> i am cannot connect my hard drive to it </s>
<s> do you know why </s>
<s> the dock looks to be the right part but you ll have to tell more </s>
<s> itis actually an internal hard drive the wd 1200bevs </s>
<s> the connection quot teeth quot on the internal drive do not appear to map directly into the docking station </s>
<s> is there any other information i should provide </s>
<s> the dock looks right to match your sata 2 5 inch laptop drive </s>
<s> now having said that i found this docks to be rather flimsy and non intuitive when it slides quot home quot you have the right parts </s>
<s> here s a cable i use instead of the docks </s>
<s> gt many out there like that </s>
