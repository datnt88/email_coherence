<s> for a short class i recently finished i built a new pc </s>
<s> the pc is amd and the current ram is 256 ddr pc2700 333mhz </s>
<s> can i get any pc2700 ram at 333mhz or could there be any exceptions that wouldn t work with my motherboard </s>
<s> i don t really know that much about pc hardware not sure what my motherboard is but my processor is a sempron </s>
<s> just checked it s a syntax motherboard </s>
<s> sorry also the syntax mb is a sv400 </s>
<s> ddr pc2700 333mhz you mentioned this ram installed you need more of the same </s>
<s> i suggest you visit for a match to your mtrbd </s>
<s> model and order it </s>
<s> but offhand just about any pc2700 should work just be sure if you can return it if it doesn t as some systems do get picky epseically if you tweek it too much </s>
<s> vendors offering pny specter or simpletechnology ram will also work </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> since you now know what mb you have you can check thier web site </s>
<s> but most of the time just get the same kind that you have and it should work </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> that should work then hopefully </s>
<s> kingston doesnt have syntax mother boards by the way </s>
