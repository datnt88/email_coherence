<s> we are a two person non profit office needing to get new hardware </s>
<s> we were going to buy towers and a server but i am hearing conflicting info about what we really need </s>
<s> i am not sure we want to host our emails fire wall and domain because i now nada about that so if something failed i would have to call someone for support </s>
<s> so now i am doing research on nas and file servers </s>
<s> we do all of our website maintenance collateral material and artwork </s>
<s> we don t necessarily need to access ms exchange our computers away from the office other software out there than can do that </s>
<s> can someone tell me the pros and cons of server vs nas for a small business </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> no 2 person office i know runs a server or even a nas </s>
<s> what for </s>
<s> as to email you can do like most and use some gmail account while on the road </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if you growth rate or needs are simple then keep the system simple </s>
<s> the nas will do what you want </s>
<s> however you limited in expansion up to a point </s>
<s> any decent system can have the nas added as for any true server needs then you must look at the whole system to match what you want to do </s>
<s> you can look at some outside network service and allow them to host you and your cause </s>
<s> that way the expertise is on their end and all you provide is the content </s>
<s> of course this costs but it doesn t hurt to see what it involves </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> thank you r and willy </s>
<s> i appreciate your advice </s>
<s> you referred to exchange server </s>
<s> do you have one </s>
