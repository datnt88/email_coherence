<s> i just replaced the cpu fan on my computer </s>
<s> i had to take the motherboard out to get to it because the screwdriver kept slipping athlon xp a462 </s>
<s> i put everything back together exactly how i found it </s>
<s> then when i hit the power button my new fan starts spinning and everything sounds good but nothing show up on the monitor says no signal </s>
<s> i know the monitor is good because it worked before i took everything apart </s>
<s> i have already reseated the ram and cpu and checked voltage on the cmos battery 3v </s>
<s> did i kill my motherboard </s>
<s> thanks all help appreciated </s>
<s> by the way my specs are pc chips m825g athlon xp processor 1 67ghz </s>
<s> 1 is the video cable plugged in </s>
<s> 2 any beeps </s>
<s> watch what happens to most athlon xp chips if you don t get the heatsink and compound right at </s>
<s> the video cable is plugged in and there are no beeps surprisingly </s>
<s> gt tell us about the heatsink compound </s>
<s> the video i shared showed how fast this cpu smokes if the heatsink isn t on proper </s>
<s> the big clue is quot no beeps quot in closing type bad caps on google com for another cause </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> there was not much heatsink compound on the old fan </s>
<s> on the new one there was plenty already applied </s>
<s> i ll have to take a look at the caps later </s>
<s> thanks </s>
