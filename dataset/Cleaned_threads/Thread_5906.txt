<s> and doesnt require any installation program </s>
<s> a lot that i looked at had bad reviews </s>

<s> what will help me then </s>
<s> i thought there were only flash drives </s>
<s> my oldest flash drive is years old </s>
<s> i think that s great but your post seemed to want something for the decades </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> these days it s a pretty mundane topic </s>
<s> i have used the fancy names like lexar and sandisk with the same success as lesser known generic store brand usb drives </s>
<s> just make sure it is a usb 2 0 model </s>
<s> check reviews at online stores like newegg com </s>
<s> the rest is all the bells and whistles you think you need color key loops mp3 player security software material finish cartoon characters ballpoint pen swiss army knife etc </s>
<s> i do someties spend more to get the model that comes with encryption software very handy </s>
