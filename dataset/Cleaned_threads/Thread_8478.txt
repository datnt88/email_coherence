<s> hello all i am looking to upgrade my current desktops processor </s>
<s> the motherboard is a pegatron m2n78 la violet </s>
<s> is it worth replacing the amd phenom ii x4 925 2 80ghz that came stock </s>
<s> if so what would be a good one to replace it with </s>
<s> i would like it to be decent at running cpu heavy games </s>
<s> most motherboards are designed for a certain brand and range of processors </s>
<s> this is due to varying types of connections speeds and connections </s>
<s> obviously intel and amd use different sockets but within each there re different sockets speeds and features </s>
<s> also a processor is designed to work with a certain type of ram e g </s>
<s> ddr ddr2 ddr3 so you d probably need new ram to go with the processor and motherboard </s>
<s> so you re looking at 200 to 300 and you still have your old hard drive ports power supply operating system and probably no warranty </s>
<s> so i know i d just spend a little more and buy a new computer </s>
<s> ymmv </s>
<s> what game are you asking about as most are fine with that cpu but with the best gpu you can fit </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you are right </s>
