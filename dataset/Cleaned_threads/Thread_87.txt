<s> i m building a comp </s>
<s> and i was wondering if any has any experience with sli memory </s>
<s> i ll be putting it on an asus striker extreme motherboard e6600 cpu </s>
<s> i just want to know if it is all hype or is it good </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i personally haven t used it yet but i m getting ready to use some in a system i m building next week </s>
<s> apparently it comes pre loaded with a few different performance specs to make overclocking easier or at least that s my take on it </s>
<s> the only company i know of that manufactures sli ram is corsair and that s due to the partnership they created with nvidia to use the sli moniker </s>
<s> it isn t going to enhance sli performance it s just using the same 3 letters </s>
<s> it should work just as well as any other ram on the market </s>
<s> ocz makes sli memory also </s>
<s> but you are right corsair is tight with nvidia </s>
