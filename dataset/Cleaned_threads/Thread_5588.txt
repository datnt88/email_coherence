<s> you have to disable your integrated graphics first </s>
<s> then you can install the card </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> your motherboard has an agp slot </s>
<s> then the onboard graphics chip is probably better than that card unless the motherboard is really old </s>
<s> what is your motherboard and why are you trying to install this card </s>
<s> by using the info you provided for the video card it is not much of a video card by today s standards </s>
<s> also sounds like the card may be faulty </s>
