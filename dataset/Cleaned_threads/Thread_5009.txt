<s> hello everyone i m going to buy a tablet soon but i just don t know wich one to choose </s>
<s> my budget is around 500 dollars </s>
<s> things that are important to me are a large memory expendable via micro sd works for me too a fast device absolutely zero lag a great screen and great looks </s>
<s> at first i was thinking to buy the apple ipad mini 64 gb or the ipad 4 32 gb </s>
<s> please help me out thanks </s>
<s> i ve yet to see any device with no zero lag </s>
<s> can you share why a tablet at all </s>
<s> it sounds as if you were shopping for a gaming laptop tablet </s>

<s> and the office has graciously supplied me with that nexus 7 and an older transformer tf300t </s>
<s> but i m still on my laptop </s>
<s> go figure </s>

<s> hey i m not buying a tablet for gaming and stuff as i already have a gaminglaptop </s>
<s> i m just looking for a tablet with fast webbrowsing and short loading times for things like youtube email spotify the tablet will be used at home because i don t feel like booting my pc up every time i want to check my email </s>
<s> and with quot zero lag quot i do not mean zero lag i mean the fewest lag possible sorry for my english </s>
<s> the tablet with the lowest lag will not be one we can discuss as even if i noted it here it would be out of date by tomorrow </s>
<s> the top 10 are all nice and i have one of those in the 10 and another model of another in the 10 why not one of the top 10 models </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> correction </s>
<s> i don t own these </s>
<s> the office is porting apps so i get to use them a lot </s>
<s> i decided to buy the ipad mini 64 gb </s>
<s> just got it yesterday and i love it </s>
<s> fast response and fine build quality also a quick tablet overall </s>
<s> the only downside is that is has no retina display but the screen is still magnificent </s>
<s> thanks for the advice </s>
<s> bye </s>
<s> i decided to buy the apple ipad mini </s>
