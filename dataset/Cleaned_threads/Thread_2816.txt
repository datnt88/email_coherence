<s> i currently have a 750gb pata drive only about 20 25gb actually used the rest is free that i want to clone onto a 300gb velociraptor drive recently purchased for increased performance of my system </s>
<s> i am going to use arconis true image to clone the disk and i was wondering if anyone had any issues cloning a partition from a larger disk to a smaller disk </s>
<s> would any data be potentially lost even though the pata drive is only about 20 25gb full right now </s>
<s> they should the data would still be on the pata </s>
<s> and if you miss some you could always reconnect the pata and recopy the missing part </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i ve used acronis to go from multi partitioned larger drives to smaller drives without a problem </s>
<s> you shouldn t have too any trouble </s>
<s> my best advise would be to just take your time and double check your setting before you execute the job </s>
<s> bwg ms it </s>
