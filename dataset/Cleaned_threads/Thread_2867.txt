<s> i had a gateway laptop with a 20gb internal drive that contained a good bit of data </s>
<s> the laptop bit the dust motherboard issue so i removed the hard drive from the laptop and now have it in an external usb 2 enclosure </s>
<s> when i jack the old drive into the usb 2 port on my desktop it recognizes that the drive is attached </s>
<s> everything looks good in device manager </s>
<s> as seems to be everyone s problem it does not show up in my computer </s>
<s> the volume is showing as disk 5 under disk management layout is partition type is basic file system is ntfs same as the root drive and the status shows healthy active </s>
<s> it is not assigned a drive letter and the only activity available to me is to delete the partition </s>
<s> i am trying to access the drive to recover the data so i d like to avoid reformatting for obvious reasons </s>
<s> the desktop is a vaoi rb42g running xp with media center </s>
<s> the laptop was running win2k </s>
<s> any insight would be appreciated </s>
<s> i boot a knoppix please use google to see what it thinks </s>

<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> i am booting knoppix off of a dvd and it does in fact see the drive and can access the data </s>
<s> forgive me fo not being a linux user but i cannot transfer the data between drives </s>
<s> i believe it because i do not have write privileges </s>
<s> i ve tried changing up permissions but i do not know the root password </s>
<s> are you aware of a default </s>
<s> thanks for the help to date </s>
<s> i hunted down the root password issue on my own and can log in under it but i still don t seem to have rights to create folders on any drive or transfer the data </s>
<s> i m booting off of the dvd burner drive so that doesn t work as an option either </s>
<s> further thoughts </s>
<s> thanks shawn </s>
<s> an usb memory key usb hard disk in fat32 format or usb cdrw drive or go across a network to backup in that situation </s>
<s> the knoppix confirms the files are still there </s>
<s> can i ask if you partitioned it with partition magic </s>
<s> it seems to be a source of this issue </s>
