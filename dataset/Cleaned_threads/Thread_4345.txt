<s> have a dial up connection on a pii system with win 98 i can go on line and everything operates normally but after a while i cannot go into new pages always get an error message </s>
<s> if i close down the connection and then reload the system again works normally </s>
<s> i recently removed a trojan worm and do not know if this is a residual problem or if my modem is beginning to fail </s>
<s> any advice </s>
<s> you left out what may be the vital clue </s>
<s> always share a quot quoted quot error message without typographic errors </s>
<s> since you had a trojan it s possible that the os suffered damaged </s>
<s> you will have to eject all parasites run iefix and supply that error message </s>
<s> if you use kazaa imesh or such computer unfriendly programs don t expect anything to ever fix it </s>
<s> we call those machines quot kazaa d quot it s a codeword that means a lot </s>
<s> light reading optimizing windows at at the moment i don t see a hardware issue </s>
<s> i do see that some behaviour should be changed since it allowed the trojan on the machine </s>
<s> find and help that user to not catch such what can be devastating bugs </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ran iefix with no error message and i have never downloaded kazaa or it s ilk </s>
<s> actually i used the wrong term when i said quot error message quot </s>
<s> i am actually getting the normal timed out message on all pages i try to enter but if i restart the modem connection i am able to operate normally </s>
<s> i also use a fully updated and activated version of nav 2002 and no one else has access to my machine </s>
<s> i do not open exe files from anyone unless i am expecting them </s>
<s> can only assume trojan got on machine while surfing news or retailer sites but don t know why nav didn t alert me </s>
<s> all i can offer is that page timeouts are discussed in prior discussions </s>
<s> your new post quot actually i used the wrong term when i said quot error message quot </s>
<s> i am actually getting the normal timed out message on all pages i try to enter but if i restart the modem connection i am able to operate normally quot again didn t supply any error message that points to anything specific </s>
<s> since nav doesn t do parasites and you didn t write what you do about such your work and reply is incomplete </s>
<s> best of luck bob </s>
<s> get your hands on the pgm </s>
<s> called quot trojan remover quot of the same name </s>
<s> update it and allow it to work you have demo use of it for 30 days </s>
<s> also beware that av pgms </s>
<s> aren t as adapt to catch all trojans as other malware but some </s>
<s> of course the latest threats can sneak by and do thier dirty work </s>
<s> if you haven t already try an quot online scan quot of other popular av pgms </s>
<s> like trendmicro rav mcafee etc </s>
<s> the results good or bad can be enlightening </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
