<s> but it will connect to a different isp </s>
<s> ok we have a strange situation </s>
<s> first i am not a computer or networking expert </s>
<s> i have managed to hack together a home system consisting of a linksys ea2700 nettalk voip unit dvr for our cctv system a printer and a few wired complicators and a wireless laptop </s>
<s> all of this is through one of our isp s we have 2 now we recently had a new complicator built </s>
<s> nothing fancy just win7 64bit </s>
<s> when i tried to connect it to the network it wouldn t even acknowledge it s existence </s>
<s> so i connected it to the other not in the network isp and bingo connected like a champ </s>
<s> obviously there is a setting missing somewhere </s>
<s> my question is how do i get the new complicator to join the network </s>
<s> i ve fished this around a few other threads but no one seems to have a clue so cnet you re up </s>
<s> without adding drivers and maybe more just win7 64bit does not get on a network anymore </s>
<s> as to the isp network connection test i would be guessing that would be some other issue but as presented with the slim details it s back to its maker to have them fix it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this is a start thanks </s>
<s> so i need to find and install drivers </s>
<s> any idea which ones </s>
<s> i m not too thrilled with the kids who built the computer </s>
<s> they seem to like going to the beach more than supporting their builds right now </s>
<s> that the motherboard is a gigabyte ga h61m ds2h if that helps </s>
<s> but as presented it s just windows 7 64 bit and after we install that we get to install the drivers or some things don t work </s>
<s> i can t tell from the post so far what s different in the two connections so i can t make a guess yet </s>
<s> but the story is typical so my first guess is just an incomplete windows setup </s>
<s> there are shops that build pcs and they get a few different types of clients </s>
<s> the un fun one is the quot clean install quot client </s>
<s> it s not fun when they get after you for installing an app to turn on the wifi so you get to show them it doesn t work without it then you descend into the conversation about quot then you must have the wrong driver quot well and it s a deep one that can lead to shops that toss on the barest of installs and leave the fine tuning to the end user </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> to suspect that s the case here </s>
<s> these kids are sons of an old friend who are trying to get started in the computer biz </s>
<s> they know how to build gaming rigs but i don t care about that i ve left numerous messages for them but have yet to receive a reply </s>
<s> i d call their dad but i don t want to screw up an old friendship over this sigh </s>
<s> i didn t see how the two connections were different so i can t make another guess other than drivers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s certainly the most help i ve found so far </s>
<s> for that i say thank you </s>
<s> from another site quot if you go into the nics properties and the advanced tab see if speed and duplex is set to auto </s>
<s> if it is set it to 10mb and full duplex and save the settings quot did that and it worked although i m sure you were about to tell me that anyway eh </s>
<s> haha thanks eh </s>
<s> i ve only had to do that once in over a decade and it was a bad driver that fixed it later </s>
<s> out of the box you should never have to do this but don t and i never argue with success </s>
<s> bob </s>
