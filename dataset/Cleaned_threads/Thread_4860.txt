<s> i have my internal hard drive set up with 3 partitions </s>
<s> on the 1st partition i have xp sp1 </s>
<s> i use that for a backup operating system </s>
<s> on the 2nd partition i have xp sp3 and i use it as my primary operating system </s>
<s> the 3rd partition is the largest and i use it just for storage </s>
<s> i dont really need it because i recently purchased a large external drive </s>
<s> i really want to try the linux based ubuntu operating system </s>
<s> can i install it on the 3rd partition </s>
<s> here s the rub you can install as many oses as you like quot provided quot they don t interfere with each other </s>
<s> now saying that and doing that are two different things </s>
<s> trail and error is the most instructive lesson you can learn </s>
<s> you already got a difficult setup now with xp sp1 and sp3 both installed </s>
<s> so if you don t want your hard work wasted take it one step at a time </s>
<s> the boot ini file will have to involved during all this so i suggest you save the current working one and or ntldr file to return to before if all fails </s>
<s> in a round about way if you ve tried the quot live ubuntu cd version quot you get an idea how that os will work </s>
<s> you can quot sandbox quot it using a quot virtual setup quot allowing its install within its parameters and see how things work </s>
<s> google more for virtual and check it out </s>
<s> i assume you already have some arrangement now to tell which os to boot like the startup menu </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> on primary drive download and run the wubi installer shouldn t be an issue assuming you have enough drive space </s>
<s> requires about 17 gb </s>
<s> i got her running </s>
<s> now i m having trouble trying to figure out how to install my linksys wmp300n wireless card and radeon graphics card </s>
<s> windows is all i ve ever known </s>
<s> i ll be patient </s>
<s> you usual place to see if any drivers are available is to check the maker s support website </s>
<s> if not there or unavailable then google away fro linux versions or the linux world of things </s>
<s> it really makes a difference in that the more common or popular a device is the more likely you ll find linux support for it </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> go to applications ubuntu software then look in system tools </s>
<s> i found a bunch of stuff on how to install the drivers </s>
<s> it looks pretty complicated though </s>
<s> not stuff i m familiar with </s>
<s> i m going to give it a try in a few days </s>
<s> it s a pain in the butt having to pull my graphics card out each time i want to boot ubuntu </s>
<s> otherwise the system hangs up on boot </s>
<s> i m a single dad with 2 toddlers and my littlest one was diagnosed with pnuemonia today so i m gonna just spend time with him and come back to it when he s healthy </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> sincerely steve </s>
