<s> it sounds like a power issue to me </s>
<s> do you have a surge protector between the computer and the wall outlet </s>
<s> you may want to try a ups uninterruptable power supply to see if you are getting voltage dips spikes </s>
<s> if you do get a ups make sure the voltage rating is sufficient for your computer and don t plug your printer especially laser printers into it </s>
<s> if that doesn t remedy the problem you have either a faulty power supply or mobo </s>

<s> i m no expert however i suffered similar problems in that my comp without warning would switch itself off completely and then restart and boot to the welcome screen as if nothing had happened </s>
