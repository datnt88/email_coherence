<s> hello my wife is using laptop with wireless connection </s>
<s> she is trying to connect to employer s ras vpn server </s>
<s> connection made but then immediately disconnects </s>
<s> she is able to connect without problems from a public internet location </s>
<s> when goes back home after being connected at public internet location she can login from home </s>
<s> i have opened firewall up temporarily for her laptop but it still does not work consistently </s>
<s> her employer says the problem is on our dsl router or with our dsl provider </s>
<s> not sure but it doesn t look to be a problem with our dsl router </s>
<s> our dsl provider says it is on her employers side </s>
<s> any ideas would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> if only you had supplied the make model of the gear involved and the firmware versions too </s>
<s> maybe i could look into this </s>
<s> but it s work related so have your workplace it staff set you up </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> does not allow business use from your home connection and that the vpn is the tip off </s>
