<s> i really appreciate all the useful information in the recent discussion about external usb hard drives </s>
<s> i have several and while i never rely on just one copy of my stuff anywhere i do like the convinience of using these devices </s>
<s> i am curious though about the differences if any worth mentioning of using one of those cheap quot enclosures quot that accept an internal 2 1 2 or 3 1 2 inch drive </s>
<s> i have already had one that wasn t cheap just die on me </s>
<s> so i picked up a real cheap plastic dock that allows you to just slide the hd in a slot on the top </s>
<s> really handy for quick changes and testing </s>
<s> i dropped in the hd that i had in the external enclosure that failed and was able to read and copy from it instantly </s>
<s> i have to wonder whether there is a known problem with these kinds of devices and if i should phase them out of use in my multi drive back up ritual </s>
<s> they seem like they do the same thing but after having a good one just quit i am a little leary </s>
<s> anything it depends on use handling quality etc if you insert them and remove them constantly quality and durability really count </s>
<s> if you leave them in place but power off the drives when not in use that reduces wear and tear on the device connectors </s>
<s> good quality frames and removable drive trays should last a good long time and serve you well with careful use and handling </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> to be good to my electronics </s>
<s> the one that failed on me was a good quality aluminum enclosure called enermax by laureate </s>
<s> but it doesn t even have a model number on it so it s not that great </s>
<s> i had a good hitachi sata 80 drive in it and i used to use it as part of my backup routine </s>
<s> i never had to touch a cable as i would do as you said and just quot turn it on quot by pressing a power button when ever i wanted to do a backup </s>
<s> other than that i really hadn t move a wire or cable or touched the drive because you have to dis assemble this one to access the drive </s>
<s> and i was reall happy with it till one day shortly after the warranty i m sure it just wouldn t turn on </s>
<s> then i tried everything i could think of </s>
<s> another drive in it removing and using different cables and i finally decided that the unit was bad </s>
<s> that really surprised me because it actually gets very little use and i expected it to last a lot longer </s>
<s> maybe it was just one of those freak things </s>
<s> i just thought i would ask and see if anyone else had problems with that type of unit </s>
