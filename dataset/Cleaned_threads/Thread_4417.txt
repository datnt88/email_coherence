<s> i m having the darndest time cooling my cpu </s>
<s> it seems to idle at abot 55 c i had the stock fan in there but replaced it with a copper hsf with silver 5 it started off cooler when i started it up again but then went back up to 55 it s a amd athlon 3000 on an epox 8kda series mobo 1gb ram </s>
<s> any ideas on what s wrong </s>
<s> i d start by checking to see what amd recommends in terms of optimum temperature parameters and cooling </s>
<s> i m assuming that your cpu isn t seriously overclocked and that your pc isn t filled with dust </s>
<s> i wouldn t call 55 degrees overheating </s>
<s> my overclocked celeron cpu have been running at about 70c for more than 2 years now </s>
<s> high for an xp if it is the new 90 nm 64 bit cpu socket 939 it is somewhat high </s>
<s> the socket 754 3000 dissipates a max of 89 watts the 90 nm 64 watts </s>
<s> the likely problem is that the interior ambient air of the case is too hot </s>
<s> you probably need at least one more case fan but you also have to have the fans working together not fighting each other </s>
<s> try to keep that air about 1 2 inch above the hub of the cpu fan below 95 f 35c </s>
<s> amd tests the hsf that comes with the retail box cpu at 40c ambient to provide adequate cooling </s>
<s> but at that internal ambient temp the cpu will be running about what you are getting </s>
<s> now i only use cases that have a top fan exhausting air and a side fan blowing in a rear exhaust fan and a power supply with two fans </s>
<s> i keep the interior below 90f </s>
<s> sometimes i also add a front intake fan </s>
<s> both amd and intel have multiple cpu s that use the same numbers even though they may differ substantially </s>
<s> thus you really need to specify the specific cpu version </s>
<s> you can downoad all types of thermal data and voltage information on each cpu model version from the amd site </s>
<s> hi cool your cpu then it will perform </s>
<s> amd cpu gets hot </s>
<s> you should apply the heatsink compound to the heatsink </s>
<s> also check the fan </s>
<s> you can check the following page for cpu installation </s>
<s> check out the cpu tips for amd based system on the following page </s>
<s> thanks regards sumukh </s>
<s> a good cpu operating temp is 50 deg </s>
<s> c give or take 5 deg </s>
<s> but i would look into ray s suggestion to increase the airflow in the case itself to allow more air around the cpu </s>
<s> round cables another fan funneling the flow that direction etc </s>
<s> dating back to athlon amd recommends 42 deg </s>
<s> c case temp and about 50 55 deg </s>
<s> cpu as the optimum ideal and anything close as fine </s>
<s> chuck </s>
