<s> where do you locate the network key for a wireless router </s>
<s> i am trying to establish a wireless internet connection with a 2wire wireless router connected to the host computer </s>
<s> the second computer recongines the 2wire network but because the network is locked i can not access it </s>
<s> it asks for the network key which can either be 5 13 ascii characters or 10 26 hexadecimal characters and 40 or 104 bits depending on the network configuration </s>
<s> please help thank you </s>
<s> contact the routers manufacturer for this information </s>
<s> faqs and there forums might help as well </s>
<s> keys usually come on the box it came in or are on a label on the disk </s>
<s> this might be an ip problem if your running them at the same time </s>
<s> you may need a second connection line </s>
<s> see the routers support site first then contact your ip </s>
<s> let me know the results report back please </s>
<s> you will find that on the router </s>
<s> access the router program and go to it s wireless or security section </s>
<s> there you will find it set to wep or wpa and a list of keys </s>
<s> while in the router program make a record of it s ssid channel setting and the key </s>
<s> key size is dependent on which encryption is used </s>
<s> you will need to enter all that data into your wireless connection on the computer </s>
<s> you should create your own router password and encryption keys </s>
<s> don t use any defaults as these are as good as public knowledge to those who want to access the device </s>
<s> so don t leave any of them as is </s>
<s> you can generally create what s called a quot passphrase quot which will convert to a numeric key </s>
<s> the passphrase can be some short bit of text you can remember easier than a long string of numbers </s>
