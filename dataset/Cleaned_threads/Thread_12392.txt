<s> i currently have 3 networked pcs in my house </s>
<s> these are wired using high speed cable internet </s>
<s> my question is should i consider going wireless with them </s>
<s> there are no issues with wiring but i am wondering if wireless is faster </s>
<s> im looking at the d link di 624 router with d link airplusxtremeg pci adapter </s>
<s> will this improve my speed </s>
<s> would it be worth while </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the wired speed is on a switched 100 megabit hub </s>
<s> the keyword is quot switched quot </s>
<s> you can research that it means that one computer can transfer to another witout interfering with other computers </s>
<s> the wifi g air is shared so you get 54 megabit shared and rarely do i see the 108 megabit work out except at close range </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> as bob has already pointed out wireless is not faster </s>
<s> even if it were faster your internet wouldn t be any faster because that speed is limited to what your cable isp is pushing through your cable modem and that is probably much much much slower than the worst wireless network speeds </s>
<s> so the only reason to change your wired setup is to incorporate new features </s>
<s> with wireless if you have a laptop computer you can move it around the house at will work at the kitchen table in the living room upstairs downstairs where ever </s>
<s> if you want to stream mp3 music to your home stereo you can do that wirelessly and not have to install a new network outlet behind the hi fi rack </s>
<s> and there will undoubtedly be as yet unimagined new devices in the future </s>
<s> the downside to wireless is you introduce a whole new set of security administration issues </s>
<s> so imo don t do it unless you have a definite plan for something that can t be done with your existing wires </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> thanks for the info guys </s>
<s> i think i ll keep what i have and go wireless when i purchase a laptop </s>
