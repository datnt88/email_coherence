<s> hi all i have a very pesky network printing problem on my home network </s>
<s> i have two vista home computers one xp computer and a printer in my home network </s>
<s> printer is connected to the network through a wirless switch together with one of the vista computers that it is connected to </s>
<s> the network is connected to internet through a wireless router although two vista computers are connected to it through wire </s>
<s> everythig in the network is working fine except for one thing </s>
<s> i cannot print from one of the non admin accounts on the vista computer that does not have the printer connected to it </s>
<s> printing works from the admin account on that computer </s>
<s> i use norton security on all 3 computers in the network and and have setup a full trust in norton to all devices in the network </s>
<s> the printer sharing is setup such that everybody can share and use the printer </s>
<s> when i send the document to print from this non admin user account it sends the document but printer never reacts </s>
<s> the document status in print queue displays quot printing quot </s>
<s> would anybody know what else i need to do </s>
<s> thanks milorad </s>
<s> only those with an account on the machines in question </s>
<s> it is not correct to think otherwise </s>
<s> so let s say that bob is a non admin account </s>
<s> fine </s>
<s> but does bob have an account on the machine with the share </s>
<s> many forget this trivia about windows networking </s>
<s> assuming that the printer you want to share is just a printer meaning not an aio because with this solution you may lose scanning capability you can place the printer on your network via a usb print server and connect it directly to your router via ethernet cable </s>
<s> any desktop laptop connected to the network wired or wireless can share the printer using the ip address of the printer during printer setup on each computer </s>
<s> if your router is configured to do so it will generate an ip address automatically or you can assign one yourself </s>
<s> of course each desktop laptop on the network must register with the proper wep wpa or wpa2 security unless your network is unsecured </s>
