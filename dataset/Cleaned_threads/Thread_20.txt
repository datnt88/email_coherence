<s> well i just recieved a new mother board and installed that with my new amd fx 60 and then to top it all off i added the nvidia 8800gtx </s>
<s> now the first time the computer actually booted and i wanted to install windows but i deleted on of the partions previous installtion of windows and rebooted the computer </s>
<s> this is where all hell breaks lose </s>
<s> now when i try to turn on the computer the lights the fans and the hardrive are all on but there is no animation on the screen </s>
<s> now i do have a 500 wat prowersupply but so do a lot of people who own this including my brother </s>
<s> also it is above the requirment for the card which is 450watts </s>
<s> suggestions does anyone have any guess what i should do next instead of calling nvidia and my mother baord company last resort </s>
<s> do you think it has anything to do with deleting the partion on my hardrive of my previous windows </s>
<s> i find it odd that it wont boot but last time it did </s>
