<s> i recently had to replace my computer running xp to a new one with vista </s>
<s> i am using an hp photosmart 2610 printer </s>
<s> when using xp i had the option of printing both sides manually i do not have this option with vista </s>
<s> has anyone else had this problem </s>
<s> do you have driver version 080 001 237 000 from </s>
<s> yes i have downloaded that software drivers but still do not gat the option to manually print on both sides dave </s>
<s> in word i can print the odd pages then re insert the sheets and then the even sheets </s>
<s> gt yes you have to ask hp if they dropped double sided printing </s>
<s> they have done so many times before </s>
<s> or there is another reason like office 97 on vista </s>

<s> i have the hp photosmart 8250 and have the that problem since day one with vista so it s not just your model </s>
<s> after many calls to hp i was told they have no plans on fixing the problem </s>
<s> my neighbor bought a new hp computer and printer and it wouldn t print two sided so it appears that hp has totally dropped double sided printing just as bob said </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> thanks to all of you for your reply s guess that when i go shopping for a new printer it will not be an hp </s>

<s> my cousin just bought a kodak all in one i don t know the model number </s>
