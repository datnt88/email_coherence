<s> bob </s>
<s> on top of what robert offered to do you should start looking at a replacement or swap it out the psu </s>
<s> provided a direct replacement or one that can work for the time being see if that makes any improvements </s>
<s> besides heat stress a weak or poor psu can cause restarts </s>
<s> however you can stop restarts as that is a bios action upon any failure </s>
<s> in order to stop the re looping of restarts do that check the bios and quot disable that option quot </s>
