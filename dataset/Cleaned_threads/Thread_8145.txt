<s> hi i am looking to be pointed in the right direction for a great bang for the buck motherboard for gamers </s>
<s> i don t have a ton of money to spend on it around 200 00 neighborhood </s>
<s> my main concern is that the board be future ready and reliable </s>
<s> also whether i should go pci express or stick with agp </s>
<s> the card i have in my current pc is a radeon 9800 pro 128mb </s>
<s> what i m wondering is should i get an agp board and cannibalize the old computer thus saving money or bide my time and get the pci express </s>
<s> so confused lol </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> is this a replacement motherboard for an existing system or are you building from scratch </s>
<s> if an upgrade what cpu and socket type memory amount and type video card model etc </s>
<s> do you already have </s>
<s> the 200 is for just a motherboard or for a motherboard and new pci express x16 video card </s>
<s> gonna be building from scratch </s>
<s> have an antec case slk3700 bqe for atx or btx with 350w power supply </s>
<s> only parts i will be taking from my old system are a radeon 9800 pro 128mb dvd rom 16x drive cd r rw drive and wd 80gb 7200rpm hd </s>
<s> depending on whether i decide to get an agp board or pci express board will make or break the radeon </s>
<s> the 200 is for the motherboard only </s>
<s> my main sticking point is agp or pci express do i go for agp and what are my chances of being obsolete in the near future or pci express and build the system slowly as i can only afford to build it a piece at a time </s>
<s> also will be installing new memory not moving the old cards over </s>
<s> your biggest costs will be the new video card and a new processor unless you re using the old one </s>
<s> 200 won t hack it </s>
<s> you ll spend at least that on the cpu </s>
<s> 130 for the motherboard 75 100 for memory </s>
<s> a 350w psu may work initially but you ll need to upgrade to at least 400w with 450w preferred </s>
<s> oh yeh if you computer came with windows loaded you ll have to buy a new os </s>
<s> oem supplied oses won t activiate on the new motherboard </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
