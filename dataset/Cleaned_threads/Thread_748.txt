<s> hi guys i recently got one very old configuration p4 machine </s>
<s> it contains 512mb ram card as checked by me </s>
<s> the problem here is in system properties it shows only quot 96mb of ram quot </s>
<s> i didn t find any configuration in bios although i am weak at checking bios </s>
<s> according to what i think ram might be faulty or properly working </s>
<s> if it is faulty the system wont boot </s>
<s> but here i am unable to understand the issue </s>
<s> pleas guide </s>
<s> regards uv </s>
<s> are you sure that wasnt 96mb for video card memoery not system memory </s>
<s> i dont think you can run a os on only 96mb memory </s>
<s> i also dont think that system will boot if ram is too low as 96mb </s>
<s> i am unable to make out whether any configuration has been done at the bios level </s>
<s> because of which i am posting this query </s>
<s> system configuration is p4 1 5ghz processor motherboard mecury very old model if you want i can post the model number too </s>
<s> ram 512mb sdram obsolete in market how did i come to know that windows os is showing me 96mb in my computer i checked for hardware properties </s>
<s> over there is showed me 96mb of ram </s>
<s> is there any other way to check the ram in windows xp os </s>
