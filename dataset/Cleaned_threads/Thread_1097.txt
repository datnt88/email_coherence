<s> my external recently died and idk if theres a problem with the wiring or the actual hd and when i plug it into my comp everything works fine the usb recognizes that its plugged it the lights on my external go off and it makes the same sound it does when running </s>
<s> however the external hd does not come up under my computer and my computer acts like its not there </s>
<s> i was thinking of buying a new enclosure and transfering the hd to see if that would work but i wanted to check to make sure the hd is not fried before i did that so is there anyway i could put the hd from the external into an old computer replace the hd i don t care for lost data on either hd to see if the hd is fried or not </s>
<s> what other choices do i have in terms of saving and being able to use the hd because its fairly new and i didnt want to have to buy another one </s>
<s> old external hdd before getting another external case vapcmd </s>
<s> if you want to test the drive to see if its just the external case that is the problem take the drive out of the case </s>
<s> the drive shoudl be either ide or sata </s>
<s> more likely sata if it is newer and ide if it is older </s>
<s> once you have the drive out of the case you will be able to slide the contoller off the hdd and see the type of connection the hdd uses </s>
<s> at this point all you need to do is plug the drive into a computer using the ide or sata cable and then boot up and see if the drive is recognized </s>
<s> make sure when you do this you do not disconnect the drive currently in the computer because you will need to boot from it </s>
<s> the drive in question should show up in my computer as a secondary drive if it still works </s>
<s> if you do this and do not see the drive the drive is bad </s>
