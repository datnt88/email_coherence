<s> unplug the data cable from the back of the optical unit </s>
<s> if it still opens replace the optical unit 20 buck item </s>
<s> since this happens before you even get to windows that suggests a h w problem </s>
<s> the other poster is right just replace the drive you probably have no recourse to fix it </s>
<s> i would think this is a broken or jammed sw at tray door </s>
<s> since this is intermittent then likely a broken sw you can reseat the data cable if you like or replace </s>
<s> be sure if you buy new replace with similar type drive as in eide or sata type </s>
<s> you could borrow an used drive and see if it repeats action </s>
