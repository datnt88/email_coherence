<s> i ve been happy with a canon pixma ip2000 printer and can replace the 2 ink cartridges for less than 2 00 each </s>
<s> a new canon printer quot free quot with my camera purchase uses proprietary cartridges which cost 30 each so i d like to find a replacement for my trusty ip2000 which will use generic and inexpensive ink </s>
<s> do you have recommendations </s>
<s> the latest canon is the ip3500 it uses canon s more traditional 4 ink tank system </s>
<s> around 16 for black and 14 per color </s>
<s> i wouldn t see any problem finding generics or refilling due to their simple design </s>
<s> you might check at walgreens and see how much refills are </s>
<s> i would avoid epson because of issues w printhead clogging </s>
<s> when you step up to the ip4500 you get two paper trays and auto paper feeding </s>
<s> also an extra lighter black ink and higher print resolution for photos </s>
<s> if using refilled ink is a concern then i d stay away from advanced photos printers and some of the newer hp s that use the 02 cartridges </s>
<s> refilling in those might cause problems with their newer permanent printhead system </s>
<s> hope that helps </s>
<s> in the past i would have defended epson printers as being dependable and wonderful machines </s>
<s> i cannot do that any more </s>
<s> i have been royally disappointed with the entire line since my first c80 </s>
<s> that printer served me well for years </s>
<s> however the subsequent printers c82 c84 and c88 and the cx1600 all using the lovely but problematic durabrite ink clogged </s>
<s> epson refuses to acknowledge they have a problem and just continue to sell a product that is bound to fail usually shortly after the warranty is over </s>
<s> i can t say i am thrilled with the hp printer i have either </s>
<s> my second hand canon i use at my work place seems to be doing better than either the epson or the hp </s>
<s> i d look at canon again </s>
<s> check your prices it seems to me </s>
<s> my canon cartridges cost 14 25 each which makes me much happier than when i was using an epson printer which did indeed use 34 ink tanks </s>
<s> and don t even start about hp which uses such prorietary inks that you can t even buy third party tanks </s>
<s> general information note items in right column i hope you get lots of responses </s>
<s> someone i know needs a good cheap laptop printer </s>
<s> the price for cartridges is also important </s>
<s> so important that the next time i buy a printer i ll make my decision based on the cost of ink cartridges then choose the printer based on this information </s>
<s> recently my wife and i made a visited walgreen s where they refill cartridges for less then new ones can be bought </s>
<s> 5 00 less </s>
<s> epson photo stylus rx700 is what i have and i d like to see a better printer </s>
<s> i don t think so </s>
<s> prints 8 1 2 x 11 and down prints cd s dvd s greeting cards and much more </s>
<s> it has 6 inks which i get generic for 3 16 each </s>
<s> prints better than a photo shop </s>
<s> no clogging problems at all with the rx 700 plus i received a 150 rebate </s>
<s> after a years use i love it more and more </s>
<s> sorry for the very late reply </s>
<s> yea canon printers use mostly dye based inks so they don t run into the clogging issues that you get with epson </s>
<s> lexmark printers are so so </s>
<s> even with getting new printheads each time i ve heard of people still having problems </s>
<s> and when i worked at staples i saw more problems w lexmark print quality than w canon </s>
<s> it is such a same to see the decline in recent quality of epson products </s>
<s> i have an epson cx3200 all in one and it is working great </s>
<s> clogs up every now and then but nothing permanent and i ve had it for about 3 years now </s>
<s> i have had a canon multifunction multipass c555 for 12 years </s>
<s> i set it for black only mode which then accomadtes a larger black tank cartridge </s>
<s> i have refilled the cartridges for 12 years with no problems </s>
<s> canon tells me that new models will self destruct the cartridge the first time the cartridge is empty </s>
<s> once empty the cartridge will tell the electronics its always empty </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> the black cartridge filled ok but the color did not </s>
<s> the printer would not recognize the color cartridge after refilling </s>
<s> we had them refilled at walgreens </s>
<s> saved 10 00 on the black would have saved the same on the color </s>
<s> the same evening that the color failed we picked up the color cartridge at meijer for the same price new that we payed for the refill </s>
<s> this was not an quot on sale quot item </s>
<s> black works fine so far </s>
<s> i am so disappointed with my epson artisan 810 printer </s>
<s> the print heads clog and epson refuses to warranty the product becuase we used non epson ink </s>
<s> the problem is that the epson ink is very expensive and the non epson is less expensive than the epson ink </s>
<s> even though it is still much more expensive than canon s so you know what my next buy will be it is a shame that a company like epson would set such a trap for its loyal customers </s>
<s> i d hardly call somebody who buys and uses cheap non epson inkt as quot loyal quot </s>
<s> do you really mean that </s>
<s> if had you read the warranty certificate i m sure you would have read that using non epson ink would void the warranty </s>
<s> that s a quite normal provision </s>
<s> you ll find that other printer manufacturers do exactly the same </s>
<s> you can t blame epson for that in the least </s>
<s> it was your own choice to do it or not to do it </s>
<s> and you did </s>
<s> so be it </s>
<s> my advice for your next printer stick to proprietary cartridges during the warranty period </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> actually the magnuson moss warranty act of 1975 prohibits that sort of warranty terms </s>
<s> it would be like a dvd drive manufacturer saying the warranty was voided by using the wrong brand of dvd disc or car company for the wrong brand of gas etc walgreen s backs this up at their website </s>
<s> years ago during the dvd format war a few drives would burn out if you put in the wrong media type </s>
<s> no one succeeded that i heard of to get the unit fixed under warranty </s>
<s> the makers would tell you quot you put in the wrong media </s>
<s> sorry we warned you quot </s>
