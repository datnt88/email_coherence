<s> i m having troubles configuring my network </s>
<s> i ll include a link to an image of a diagram of my current network layout </s>
<s> i receive internet service from a wifi modem </s>
<s> i have a wifi adapter that recieves that internet acces and i share that internet through quot lan 1 quot on my pc </s>
<s> to share with more devices i have connected lan 1 via a crossover cable to the quot internet quot port on my wnr2000 router </s>
<s> all of the other computers and devices connected to that router can access the internet and network completely with no issues </s>
<s> my main pc however cannot access the network because of the way it is connected to the router </s>
<s> i have tried connecting the main pc s quot lan1 quot to the router using the quot ethernet quot ports on my router as opposed to the quot internet quot port with crossover but i cannot share the internet that way </s>
<s> my solution was to run a connection from quot lan 2 quot on my pc to quot ethernet 4 quot on my router in addition to the crossover connection </s>
<s> unfortunately when i enable this connection windows decides that lan 2 is now the internet service rather than the wireless connection and i lose internet to everything in my network </s>
<s> is there a way to force my pc to acknowledge that quot lan2 quot is for network acces only quot lan1 quot is for sharing internet only and quot wireless network connection quot is for recieving internet service only </s>
<s> here is a link to a picture of my network layout on photo bucket </s>
<s> the gold wire is incorrect for most configurations </s>
<s> for ics the gold wire is removed and we use the quot use the router as a wap quot setup noted at the top post of this forum </s>
<s> for ics we could use only the gold wire but i can t comment on how to correct the trouble that would cause </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what am i missing </s>
<s> i don t see the quot use the router as wap quot setup you said was at the top of the forum even a search didn t return anything that seemed useful to me </s>
<s> could you link the post you are referring to here please </s>
<s> then again you could use this search hope you find some information and get it to work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks i found that bout 2 seconds after i posted </s>
<s> i didn t even get to follow all of the instructions on netgear when started to work </s>
<s> it seems to work fine now at least the ics is working right still working on getting the network to show up on my pc but i think that s another issue alltogether </s>
<s> also i can t access my router now </s>
<s> it keeps trying to access the modem instead even though i renamed the router ip to 192 168 1 99 it keeps showing me the modem which is 192 168 1 1 any idea why this is a problem </s>
<s> i ll keep trying and thanks for the help </s>
<s> it was far easier to use than i was trying to make it </s>
<s> this system of router as a wap is not only done by many but as the router makers tinker and change the firmware the answers have to change </s>
<s> for example my wnr3500 will automatically sort out the router as wap trick and i can use its wan port </s>
<s> hope this helps bob </s>
<s> well after several hours of pulling my hair out i finally got it working </s>
<s> turns out that everything i had to do i had done before just not in the right order </s>
<s> i reset my router to factory set up my wireless security and changed the ip of the router to match that of the modem </s>
<s> i didn t make any of the other changes that were instructed in the above link because they didn t work for me </s>
<s> after disconnecting all of the pc s from the router i turned off ics in windows on my main pc and bridged quot wireless connection quot to quot lan 1 quot </s>
<s> next i plugged quot lan 1 quot into the router s quot ethernet 1 quot and left the crossover cable to the internet port disconnected </s>
<s> once that connection was made and the ip updated the internet would stop working and i d have access to the router and network </s>
<s> to fix that i disabled the network bridge then repair the wireless connection </s>
<s> after the repair i re connected lan1 to the router enabled the bridge and waited about a minute for the connection to be established </s>
<s> the wireless connection icon in my task bar showed that there was no connection but when i open internet explorer it was working fine i m using the app for the wn311t to connect to the wifi modem </s>
<s> i don t fully understand how or why it worked the way it did but i can for sure say that my wnr2000 router will not work for both networking and sharing internet when dhcp is dissabled </s>
<s> hopefully my hours of frustration will save some other sap the time and hair pulling that i went through </s>
<s> i now have my internet connection full access to the network on all pc s including the printer and file sharing </s>
<s> everything is working flawlessly now </s>
<s> ok now i m gettin flustered i checked that all of the network sharing was working and it was kinda </s>
<s> when i go to quot my network places quot i can see all shared folders in my netowork </s>
<s> i can navigate through all folders but when i try to access a file it gives me an error </s>
<s> whether i m trying to copy a file play media or run setup exe s from shared folders it always gives me some kind of access error </s>
<s> when i look at my shared folders under quot my network places quot it shows them all under quot the internet quot instead of quot local network quot </s>
<s> anyone have any idea why this is happening or how i can fix it </s>
<s> fyi i ve already tried shutting off all firewalls verified sharing is on in network connections confirmed that all files are quot shared to the network quot not just the pc and i m not sure if i can or how to kill the router firewall but if i understand right the router shouldn t firewall networked computers from each other no </s>
<s> sorry but firewalls in routers is a very new thing </s>
<s> and most of them tend to be uncontrollable bad get in the way or don t work </s>
<s> i turn them off </s>
<s> the second thing is that in a double nat setup i doubt such file shares work </s>
<s> enough written </s>
<s> the last big thing is the issues of workgroups accounts and more </s>
<s> from the posts above i can t tell if the account names passwords on the machines in question are synchronized </s>
