<s> hello i m looking to invest in a tablet i love my laptop but its battery life just can t compete and i need something i can use while traveling for reading surfing movies and listening to audiobooks with </s>
<s> i don t really know much about my options out there so i m hoping to draw on your knowledge by listing my wants and must have features hopefully you all can give me a decent set of options or even narrow it down to the perfect unit so i can invest with confidence battery life is important obviously but not as important as the unit need to be able to charge via the usb port it can have a separate power plug but it has to be able to charge if i plug it into a usb power supply </s>
<s> 7 quot 10 quot screen size not really that important but a smaller hand held that s still fairly easy on the eyes is what i m aiming for </s>
<s> decently durable i ll have it in a protective hard shell case and try to take care so it doesn t have to live up to tuff book specs but something that can go in my daypack bike panniers without falling apart </s>
<s> i don t know if this is even an option on any tablets or not but i d like to be able to connect an external hard drive via usb if i can t that s ok but i d like the tablet to have at least 4gb 8 would be better on board and it has to be expandable with sd cards i d prefer to be able to use full size sd cards but it i have to invest in some more micro well ok i don t really care about which os it runs as long as its stable can watch video youtube megavideo ect as well as downloaded movies surf the internet organizing mp3 reading pdf doc and txt other ebook formats would be cool too but as long as it can read those i ll be happy </s>
<s> as far as speed i want something that s fairly fast so a decent processor speed and memory are desirable </s>
<s> i would love it if i could add on a keyboard at some point i ve seen a few bluetooth type that look cool whether it connects that way or some other i d really like this feature but its not a deal breaker if i can t have it i hope that s not too much to ask if i could get it in hand retail new used whatever but with price including shipping for less than 250 </s>
<s> if the unit stood out enough i might be talked into going as high as 300 but i m between jobs so i have limited resources </s>
<s> thanks adam ps moderators if this post would fit better on another sub forum or it would get more of a response someplace else could you move it please </s>

<s> i see this question open at after trying a few keyboards on current android laptops not 3 0 versions i have to say you are looking at the ipad </s>
<s> yes the ipad charges from usb as noted at and has excellent keyboard support </s>
<s> yes it didn t meet your price point but today s 300 dollar pads do not meet your requirements either </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> is the ipad really the closest i can get to what i m looking for </s>
<s> the keyboard functionality is a nice extra but like i said not 100 necessary and with the extra cost and the pita of using itunes i m not sure if that would be the right choice </s>
<s> the reason i d like it to be able to charge from the usb port is that i have a couple different usb battery powered chargers that i m hoping to use to extend the battery life with does the ipad have a sd card slot </s>
<s> but since we can put stuff on dropbox it s something we don t miss </s>
<s> i m unsure what issue there is with itunes </s>
<s> here it works fine </s>
<s> never gave me any trouble </s>
<s> if we dismiss the ipad and it s very nice keyboard the samsung 7 inch android is a very nice unit and might be had for your price </s>
<s> let me warn you about android cheap tablets </s>
<s> you ll be upset if the android tablet does not have the following </s>
<s> 1 multi touch screen or quot cap touch quot do no accept resistive for your first pad </s>
<s> 2 the accelerometer </s>
<s> 3 the mic and front facing camera </s>
<s> 4 android market </s>
<s> 5 wifi and hopefully bluetooth </s>
<s> 6 the usual 800 mhz cpu or the nice new dual core 1ghz machines </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so after actually doing some research i think i may need to rebudget a bit to get one i ll be really happy with but i think i have found one that meets the spirit of my requirements if not the letter so unless anyone has had any bad experiences with it that i haven t found yet i think i m going to go with the toshiba thrive no it doesn t charge via usb but it has decent battery life and a user replaceable battery so i can still extend the life for longer trips it may cost 80 for each 7 11 hour extension but its nice to know that when the battery gets old it won t mean retiring the tab or shipping it back to the manufacturer 10 1 inch screen is a little larger than i was thinking if they made a 7 inch version of the thrive i d be all over it but thats still not to bad i like the rubberized backing on the thrive it feels tough and the texture will help to keep it from getting dropped here is the biggest reason along with the replaceable battery it has a full sized sd card port and a full usb 2 0 port that can read flash external hds </s>
<s> i know programs like dropbox are great but sometimes your or at least i m out of wifi range and i can t afford a monthly charge for 3g service </s>
<s> its a 1ghz dual core with 1gb memory so its fairly fast it has full sized usb ports and can use any keyboard with a usb plug its a bit more than i want to spend but when it comes down to quot what does it do how well does it do it quot sometimes you have to bite the bullet and budget a little bit does anyone know any reason why i shouldn t go for the thrive </s>
<s> as for my issues with itunes i just think its a huge resource hog for what it does and it seem like a pain to use just mho </s>
<s> having tried more than one android with keyboards i can say it s an odd experience as you move from keyboard to screen and back and forth </s>
<s> maybe we ll get used to that but this use is one i find annoying </s>
<s> it is faster for emails and typing a paper but why did i get the tablet when i turned it back into a notebook </s>
