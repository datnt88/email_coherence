<s> hi i ve decided to upgrade my existing pc </s>
<s> i m having a hard time deciding which route to go this time for the first time </s>
<s> i was at first going to upgrade my system to one using a 925x motherboard w pci e but it seems most of the reviews i ve read the socket 775 processors do not perform as expected and tend to run hot to boot </s>
<s> i was then thinking about waiting for the nforce4 motherboards that run on the amd 64 platform w pci e support </s>
<s> is either of these platforms an option </s>
<s> or is there something better </s>
<s> i currently have a system with a asus p4pe 845 motherboard a p4 2 53 processor with 512 meg of ddr pc2700 memory </s>
<s> one of the reasons i want to upgrade is so i can run a better agp card than what i have now mine can run only a 4x slot card </s>
<s> thanks for any advise any of you can offer </s>
<s> and mobo s with the nforce 4 are available </s>
<s> go to or and read the details about them </s>
<s> gigabyte may be the latest to come out </s>
<s> if gaming is your thing amd still wins hands down </s>
<s> yeah i have a 3 4 p4 on a intel 925xcv motherboard and it idles at around 32 and games at hottest 40 i hope i helped u </s>
