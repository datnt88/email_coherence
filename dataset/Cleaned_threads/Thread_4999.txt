<s> first of all my sincere apologies for having posted this question as a reply on another issue by mistake </s>
<s> i have a mac g3 powerbook 333mhz 4gb hd 8mb video cd </s>
<s> everytime i try to upgrade my x os operating system from 10 2 version to a newer version i get a message saying i do not have enough hd space </s>
<s> i have transferred quite a few files to a portable drive to clear space but still get the message </s>
<s> is there something else i can do to get the upgrade </s>
<s> thanks sandovh </s>
<s> that springs to mind is for you to purchase a larger hd </s>
<s> the next question is quot what os are you attempting to upgrade to quot </s>
<s> there is a limit as to the version of os x that is compatible with this laptop </s>
<s> you are going to max it out at 10 3 9 panther memory is a consideration too how much do you have installed </s>
<s> new hd s can be purchased for a reasonable sum and some suppliers even install the drive move your original stuff to it and put your old drive into a firewire enclosure </s>
<s> that last bit is not going to help you as i don t think you have firewire on that machine </s>
<s> does this machine have a bronze keyboard </s>
<s> if so putting your old drive into an enclosure that fits into the cd battery slot is also an option </s>
<s> another consideration for that machine is a processor upgrade and lots of ram </s>
<s> both are possible and reasonably easy to do </s>
<s> if you really do not want to spend any money at all the absolutely positively definitely not recommended way is to boot from the installer cd and choose format and install </s>
<s> this will kill every piece of data that you have on that machine </s>
<s> it will install your new os though </s>
<s> do not do this pretty please </s>
<s> hope this helps let us know what the answers are p </s>
<s> i would suggest that you check to see how much space the new upgrade requires as to what the total space you have on your hard drive </s>
<s> it just simply may be too large for your existing drive </s>
<s> if that is the case there are only two possible solutions 1 upgrade to a larger version of the powerbbook which will have a much larger hard drive </s>
<s> 2 get an apple repairmnan to see if he can install a larger hard drive for you that would have room for your new os 10 2 and the other material you plan to use on the hard drive and then get a portable disk drive such as a lacie 200 gb or less disk drive to carry with you to store your material on which you are working </s>
<s> most of these use either or both a usb usb 2 connector or some use a firewire connector if your computer will accept it </s>
<s> fire wire is usually faster </s>
<s> you may need a usb hub if you have only one usb outlet on the side of your powerbook </s>
<s> good luck in your project </s>
<s> bob curtis </s>
<s> hi it sounds like you re running a lombard powerbook which can run osx panther but quot crawl quot may in fact be a more appropriate term </s>
<s> why do you want to upgrade </s>
<s> is there a program you want to run </s>
<s> speaking of running you re going to run out of space very quickly on a 4gb drive </s>
<s> upgrading to panther will accelerate the process </s>
<s> additionally should you choose to invest in a larger hard drive i believe you may have to do quot special formatting quot on it so the os sees the drive correctly </s>
<s> i know that on the wallstreet the model before yours drives larger than 7 5 gb must be partitioned so that osx resides on the first partition of the drive and that partition must be 7 5 gb or less </s>
<s> another space saving tip when installing you can choose to omit some utilities and language localizations but in panther you will still be squeezed quite a lot on this machine </s>
<s> i recommend finding a decent used powerbook on ebay or some other venue like perhaps craigslist org if you can </s>
<s> i have a 400 mhz g4 powerbook mercury and if loaded with enough ram this machine performs very well for most tasks </s>
<s> it s not at all bad for a four year old computer </s>
<s> i have updated the hard drive to a 40gb i acquired the machine in dire need of repair which made it very affordable and brought the ram to 512 though it can go to 1gb </s>
<s> on your machine the most you can go to is 512mb </s>
<s> that s the thing really </s>
<s> if you want to run software published after your machine was released you will need to perform some hardware upgrades anyway </s>
<s> and while you re upgrading you should seriously consider all of your options </s>
<s> if you are interested in upgrading to tiger osx 10 4 apple does not support this os on your machine </s>
<s> there is however a utility you can use called xpostfacto to install tiger </s>
<s> while i know that xpostfacto works well with panther on the wallstreet powerbooks i have no experience with tiger on a laptop such as yours </s>
<s> the typical 10 3 installation is about 3 gb there is little chance that you can install it on this hd especially since you probably already have programs and files take take up more than 1 gb </s>
<s> there is no way that you can easily run 10 3 on this small space even if you are somehow able to install it </s>
<s> i would get at least a 20gb drive install it in the g3 and put the old drive in an external usb enclosure so that you can use the old drive as a backup </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> dan </s>
<s> your description indicates that you have a 1999 model powerbook otherwise known as a lombard </s>
<s> given that fact the best os possible without outside interference is os x 10 3 panther </s>
<s> panther s default install requires 2 1 gb of free space </s>
<s> a full install needs about 3 2 gb and my best guess is that you can t make enough free space to satisfy this requirement no matter what you do </s>
<s> as others have suggested you could move your current macos installation to a larger drive </s>
<s> an easy way out for sure but it could cost you time and money </s>
<s> you could also try disabling the default archive and install option when setting up panther as an upgrade </s>
<s> your system folders and core applications should be updated and your user settings should be left intact </s>
<s> the best solution however may be this back up your users folder and any downloaded applications that you may have and then format and install panther </s>
<s> you can then copy the data you retrieved back to your hard disk </s>
<s> good luck redmage0326 </s>
