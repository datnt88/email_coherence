<s> ok i have 2 problems here i have a quantum bigfoot tx it is a huge harddrive </s>
<s> i placed this into my old computer without any tab on the jumper settings and on the space farthest from the mother board on the ide cable when i go to boot the computer it says detting hdd primary slave quantum bigfoot tx4 bat but says nothing about detecting the master then it says primary master hard disk fail i have added the pin to the jumper settings in the back and set it to master but when i do this it says detecting primary master none detecting primary slave none then when i let it boot through it gives me a disk i o error replace the disk and press any key the harddrive im putting in has no operating system on it </s>
<s> try just one drive at a time </s>
<s> test as master on the end black connector and the blue connector to the motherboard </s>
<s> what happens </s>

<s> what do you mean by the end black and blue conectors to the mother board and i am only using 1 drive </s>
<s> quot what do you mean by the end black and blue conectors to the mother board and i am only using 1 drive </s>
<s> quot i always use a shiny new 80 conductor ide cable to make sure its not part of the issue </s>
<s> your choice </s>
<s> said cables are color coded so i noted which to use by color </s>
<s> best of luck </s>
<s> the ide cables conected are new and conected properly but im still having this problem </s>
<s> it wont stop vewing my big foot hard drive as a slave drive evin when its the only hard drive hooked up to the system </s>
<s> you seem unsure what ide cable type you have </s>
<s> i know not everyone will be experts under the hood of the pc but shrug that off and let s go to work </s>
<s> you questioned me on the color of the ide connections and that was my test and my clue that you likely have the older ide cables </s>
<s> if so the setup can torture some owners </s>
<s> why not get a shiny new 80 conductor ide cable with the black blue and gray connectors and set the drive to cs cable select so we know where we are </s>

<s> this computer is an old q systems </s>
<s> when i plug in its old harddrive it boots just fine but its old hard drive was beat up and just stoped working so i tried my other working hard drive and it keeps thinking its a slave drive </s>
<s> it only has this problem when i dont use its origional hard drive </s>
<s> i m still at the beginning with wondering what cable type and jumpers you use </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> now im having other isues </s>
<s> the ide cables are standered ide cables and i just use a little black pin that came with the hd </s>
<s> tell me what you set the drive to </s>
