<s> hi i have a question about the data transfer rate of sata drives </s>
<s> i am looking to build a new desktop pc and looking to upgrade to an internal sata drive </s>
<s> however i am confused about the data transfer rate </s>
<s> take a look at this ad from bestbuy com hitachi deskstar 1tb internal hard drive oa34915 serial ata interface data transfer rates up to 3gb sec </s>
<s> 32mb cache buffer this is a cover page </s>
<s> when i click on the item detail 1tb maximum storage capacity serial ata interface data transfer rates up to 300mb sec </s>
<s> 32mb cache buffer 7200 rpm for fast read write times 8 5 ms average seek time pc compatible so what is the data transfer rate of this drive 3 0gb sec or 300mb sec </s>
<s> can someone shed some light on this </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> that s the maximum transfer rate over the sata link and not what speed the drive will actually deliver </s>
<s> so toss that out the window and go find benchmarks on that hard disk </s>
<s> it s 3 gigabit per second or 300 megabyte per second </s>
<s> sadly you ll find many typos all over so do a little research such as where they take the trouble of writing 3 gbit per second and the upper lower case typo won t strike them down </s>
