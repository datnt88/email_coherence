<s> hello ppl this is my first post </s>
<s> i have this strange problem on my friend s comp and hope to solve it </s>
<s> the config is amd 64 x2 3600 and msi k9ngm motherboard based on nvidia 6100 chipset </s>
<s> the problem is as follows the latest drivers and forceware drivers have been installed </s>
<s> also latest version of directx 9 has been installed after a fresh installation on winxp </s>
<s> when attempting to play games like fifa05 return to castle wolfenstein counter strike cz the screen blanks out </s>
<s> then jagged pixelated image video of the game begins virtually not watchable as most of the screen is blank </s>
<s> this is with direct3d and direct draw enabled in dxdiag </s>
<s> general movies videos play only when direc3d and direct draw is disabled </s>
<s> videos are pixelated and have greenish tinge and basically horrible when direct3d and direct draw is enabled </s>
<s> the test of direct3d and direct draw fails with the foll result no rectangles or cubes were drawn </s>
<s> directdraw test results failure at step 5 user verification of rectangles hresult 0x00000000 error code direct3d 7 test results failure at step 32 user verification of direct3d rendering hresult 0x00000000 error code direct3d 8 test results failure at step 32 user verification of direct3d rendering hresult 0x00000000 error code im virtually clueless how to solve this is it a graphic problem as it appears to be or something els </s>
<s> will buying a graphics card help </s>
<s> or should the motherboard be changed </s>
<s> plllsssss help thanks in advance </s>
<s> while i can t comment on the game the video playback was terrible </s>
<s> a little poking around found the properties for the video card and it s color adjustments were whacko </s>
<s> moving the sliders to the usual defaults cured the video playback issue </s>
