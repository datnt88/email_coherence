<s> win xp sp3 intel 8400 dual core 2 gig ram have 4 hdd plus put sil image 3124 raid controller in pci slot </s>
<s> three 2 tb wd green drives connected to the raid controller plus 4 more hdd to motherboard sata connections </s>
<s> i first formatted each 2tb drive then connected to sil image raid controller and told it to set up a raid 5 parity array 3 ea 2tb drives should give 4tb raid 5 available </s>
<s> that took 4 days </s>
<s> finally says it completed the task </s>
<s> i boot win expecting to see it nothing </s>
<s> doesn t show up in explore not in disk management </s>
<s> sil image software says it s good to go it just isn t there </s>
<s> check bios does not show up as a drive but interesting the raid controller card is listed as a possible boot drive </s>
<s> check system hardware device manager </s>
<s> it s listed under scsi and raid controllers and says it s working and driver is fine </s>
<s> it is also listed under disk drives but volumes is blank when i populate it says status unknown disk unreadable 0 available </s>
<s> using 3 each 2tb drives in a raid 5 should give me 4 tb available </s>
<s> going back to software under program it shows up shows is raid 5 but under raid group tab there s an option bring raid group online but it is grayed out </s>
<s> any help </s>
<s> bios software windows disk management can t find anything to make it active or bring it online </s>
<s> no story about how you partitioned and formatted the raid i m left with more questions than answers </s>
<s> maybe it s back to the maker to ask them what s wrong </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i thought creating the raid array was in essence formatting </s>
<s> don t know as this is my first raid endeavor </s>
<s> still i can t find it anywhere to partition one large partition desired and can t format if it doesn t show up on disk manager or anywhere </s>
<s> i ve worked with single drives and had to active them then format them etc but while the raid controller shows up in several places nothing shows up as a drive or array </s>
<s> i ve tweaked and rebooted several times etc </s>
<s> silicone image says they don t support consumers and fry s didn t help </s>
<s> i m usually fairly good at computer stuff and a resource for others but this has me stumped </s>
<s> i may give up and just make it pass through which will give me 6 tb of storage but no backup in case of a drive failure </s>
<s> i tried minitool data recovery as the controller showed up there similar to a drive but it found only a single 2tb drive and started to scan and maybe recover data </s>
<s> i figured that would be the one 2tb drive i started with before trying raid and it could find some files that were on it prior to formatting </s>
<s> it was acting like it was pass through to a single drive instead of a raid array </s>
<s> i didn t want to mess up the raid so i stopped the scan before it could make any changes </s>
<s> i would have thought the raid array would show up as a single drive with a single name designation then i could activate format or do whatever necessary to use the array </s>
<s> but it doesn t show up anywhere useable </s>
<s> or the install instructions are bad </s>
<s> return the raid controller as defective since you followed the instructions </s>
