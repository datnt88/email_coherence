<s> recently purchased macbook pro 17 quot </s>
<s> all fonts are micro type </s>
<s> web pages are columns using only one half to one third of the nice big screen </s>
<s> i can quot zoom quot but that is not a permanent solution </s>
<s> this includes the tool bar its tiny </s>
<s> how do i make things readable and fit the screen </s>
<s> i cannot find the answer in the manual or online but i may be searching the wrong criteria </s>
<s> help in the form of the correct web page is fine </s>
<s> this question gets asked by recent switchers who are used to having a web page fill the entire screen </s>
<s> problem with that is that the web pages are not built to fill the whole screen </s>
<s> most are built to accommodate a 19 quot monitor </s>
<s> try hitting the green button top left of the window and safari will expand to the actual size of the web page </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> the problem you are having is a real pain if you own an older model 17 quot mb pro but if you have the latest model then simply decreasing screen res should do the trick </s>
<s> current model mb pros don t suffer the slightly soft out of focus screen that results when you use any setting other than the highest screen res </s>
<s> but if you did buy an older model then you are just going to have to live with command every time you open a new browser window </s>
<s> or you can decrease screen res and learn to live with the slightly soft screen </s>
<s> 1600 x 1000 is the lowest setting i can tolerate but image text will still appear proportionally smaller than on a 15 quot mb pro set to a native res of 1440 x 900 or a 20 quot apple cinema display set to its native res of 1680 x 1050 </s>
