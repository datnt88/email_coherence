<s> i m wiring our new fire station and need some insight </s>
<s> i will start with a brief overview of our network cable router to netgear wireless router to 4 wired connections </s>
<s> the problem i m having is with the levitron keystore jacks for cat5e </s>
<s> i have wired these in 568b format </s>
<s> the wiring was installed by the contractor </s>
<s> all lines terminate in a closet along with telephone and cable </s>
<s> the ends of the cat5 in the closet i have terminated with male plugs to connect to the netgear router </s>
<s> the other ends are in varies wall plugs in the building </s>
<s> i connected 2 yesterday according to the label for 568b </s>
<s> i can t connect on either of these plugs </s>
<s> i have also wired them in 568a and crossover just to try </s>
<s> i removed one of the keystones and put a male plug on to test connection </s>
<s> this worked without an issue </s>
<s> i have tried 3 plugs out of the package of 10 </s>
<s> i m only removing the outer sheath untisting 1 2 quot leaving the individual wire sheathing and using a 110 punch tool to install in the keystone </s>
<s> i m sorry this is long winded but i wanted to try to answer any basic questions up front </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea what the issue could be </s>
<s> i find the colors reversed on those see again </s>
<s> thanks i ll check that </s>
<s> i know it has to be something simple </s>
<s> i had been wiring all day when this issue came up and i chose to walk away as i was getting fustrated </s>
<s> you may very well be right about that </s>
<s> thanks for the quick reply </s>
