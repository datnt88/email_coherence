<s> my pc consistently reboots once the windows xp load screen completes </s>
<s> in other words when the logon screen should display instead the machine restarts </s>
<s> this problem originated after my house lost power i m not sure if that has anything to do with it </s>
<s> i ran a memory checker based on a friend s advice and everything seems fine there </s>
<s> i can t boot into safe mode or anything else </s>
<s> i fear a hard drive problem but hoping its something else </s>
<s> any suggested tests remedies </s>
<s> boot the xp cd and from the recovery console see run this chkdsk c f retest the boot </s>
<s> next up </s>
<s> a repair install </s>
<s> take your pick from this list </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> unfortunately the chkdsk did not work and when i tried to do a reinstall i got errors during the repair installation claiming quot setup cannot copy the file xxxxxx xxx quot </s>
<s> there is no file named that on the xp cd </s>
<s> this could mean a bad xp cd or bad cd drive or cable </s>
<s> the hard disk might be full </s>
<s> tell me the output of the chkdsk command so i can tell what state the hard disk is in </s>
<s> also it may take awhile but this could mean the hard disk couldn t be written to as in the case of sata drives </s>
<s> if you have such be sure to tell </s>

<s> i was just using the xs as space fillers </s>
<s> there are multiple files that cannot be copied probably around 20 30 mostly system files dll xsl etc </s>
<s> when i browse for the files they are right there on the cd where they are supposed to be but they will not copy </s>
<s> i also tried copying the entire directory from the cd onto the c drive and accessing the files that way but they still will not copy to wherever the install is trying to put them </s>
<s> i was able to scan my hard drive for viruses while attempting to do a reinstall but it came up with nothing </s>
<s> at this point i am considering buying a new hd installing xp on it and using it as my primary although i would like to avoid that if at all possible </s>
<s> i will re run the chkdsk and report to you the output when i get home today </s>
<s> my drive is an ata drive </s>
<s> also i do not have the chkdsk c f option only r and p i ran both and p reported that it found errors if i remember correctly but again i will get the proper wording to you later this evening </s>
<s> additionally because the reinstall crapped out and there are system files missing i get the dreaded blue screen whenever i try to boot into windows i was able to do this while browsing for the files that could not be copied i navigated the open file window to my computer and i was able to right click the c drive and scan it with mcaffee virusscan that way </s>
<s> if chkdsk is fixing errors then that s telling us that something is amiss </s>
<s> share the messages as to what it s fixing </s>
<s> i don t need the entire message but just what it s fixing </s>
<s> the part of chkdsk i d like to see is the free space </s>
<s> can you boot to a command prompt </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> booting to command prompt yields the same result a reboot </s>
<s> boot to the xp cd and find your way to the recovery console and there you can chkdsk </s>
<s> more at if you have a sata drive i ve omitted what extra steps are required </s>
