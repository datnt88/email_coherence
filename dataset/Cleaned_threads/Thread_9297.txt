<s> i just placed an order with dell for a studio xps system with core i7 processor and now i am having second thoughts about my choice for memory </s>
<s> i went with 6gb option which was the lowest offered and is 6 sticks </s>
<s> it seems sufficient as currently i am running a single core processor with 4gb of memory </s>
<s> they offer upgrades to 8gb and 12 gb </s>
<s> the 12gb upgrade costs 300 and replaces the 6 1bg sticks with 2gb sticks </s>
<s> since later expansion will require replacing sticks in the future if how likely is it that i will need that much memory in the next 3 or so years </s>
<s> i realize that this is a bit of speculation which depends on my usage and what happens in the future applications </s>
<s> i use my system for drafting rendering photo work and a very small amount of home video editing </s>
<s> so basically if you are not into gaming is 6gb a good choice or will it choke the capability of my machine </s>
<s> i would appreciate you comments and suggestions </s>
<s> thanks allen ps this is my first post </s>
<s> i expect this is a frequent question and i do not mean to be repetitive </s>
<s> if there is a relevant thread perhaps you could point me to it </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> i found this review by cnet </s>
<s> it links to a specification page that says it comes with 64 bits vista home premium </s>
<s> so it can make use of all 6 gb </s>
<s> that s nice </s>
<s> for your usage i d say that 6 gb is more than enough </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> kees thanks </s>
<s> i checked out the review </s>
<s> i had not seen this one before </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> allen </s>
<s> well it says the motherboard has 6 ram slots i dont know if that means theres gonna be 6x1gb sticks </s>
<s> either way you should be able to mis mtach ram sizes later on </s>
<s> of course i think 6gb ram is plenty </s>
<s> this has continued to be a question mark for me too </s>
<s> dell does populate all 6 slots with 1gb sticks which is a real bummer if i order now with 6gb and see that my heavy home video editing could use the full 12gb then i would have to replace all 6 1gb dimms </s>
<s> so that is a waste of the initial investment for me </s>
<s> my question if i m running corel videostudio prox2 editing a large movie 45 minutes have multiple photoshop image files open etc could this system take advantage of the full 12gb of ram </s>
<s> a previous poster recommended ordering with 6gb and monitoring usage but i don t want to waste the initial investment by throwing all those away if i see 6gb is not enough </s>
<s> i know if its dual channel the memory sticks dont have to match sizes in each slot </s>
<s> id guess its the same with triple channel id personally go for 8gb </s>
<s> its only another 100 and saves the trouble of having to buy it separate online </s>
<s> videostudio pro x2 is a 32bit app and can t take advantage of more the 2gb of ram </s>
