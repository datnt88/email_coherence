<s> g day so i could really use some help if there s anyone out there who has an idea </s>
<s> i ve asked around but the jury is still out motherboard has been the suggested issue although this is a cheap computer so if i am to spend anymore money on it i would want to know it will fix the issue </s>
<s> motherboard asus p5k e power supply corsair cx430 new hdd wd 500gb new graphics his 6450 new basically my computer will start up fine 1 300 times </s>
<s> when it does work it works for a random period before freezing in a random screen sometimes it works great other times it seems to be running unusually slow </s>
<s> in the other 299 300 times when i turn the computer on all it seems to do is power up </s>
<s> it won t connect any monitor keyboard ext hdd etc </s>
<s> recently i have noticed that if i turn my computer off at the powerpoint or leave it off for a long period i find it will power up for 5 secs until it thinks for the first time and then it turns itself off for about 3 secs and then it powers up again has a little think and thats about it it ll stay on in this state and just sit there still not connecting any external stuff </s>
<s> it has a brand new internal hdd power supply and graphics card things people have previously suggested to be the issue </s>
<s> the cmos battery has been removed and then the computer powered up to the same effect however a new battery has not been tried </s>
<s> bios drivers etc all up to date </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> replace the dang battery it will always be incorrect with the battery left out even with corrections will be lost upon the next power on </s>
<s> the cmos is a few and worth it if the pc is 2yrs </s>
<s> old or better </s>
<s> next after new battery installed edit the bios that reflects what is proper review you manual or allow defaults to rule provided they match what is required </s>
<s> your video may not be the most powerful though it maybe taxing the psu abit </s>
<s> your psu is a 430w </s>
<s> if so it maybe at the lower end of pc needs and offers a borderline operation of the pc </s>
<s> maybe after some time it finally is starting to falter or it s quot rail quot is less than capable </s>
<s> these ares of concern </s>
<s> how much ram is installed and what os </s>
<s> last it may need a bios update see what level yours is at and what s available </s>
<s> that update may correct for some issues provided they explain them not always </s>
<s> but if you have an update that s several levels above your current one it maybe good to install </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> replaced the battery today no improvement </s>
<s> can t get into the bios as i have no visual </s>
<s> the psu has only been installed recently and has been running for about 24hrs would it start to fail after such a short period </s>
<s> i have 2gb of ram and windows 7 running although operating system doesn t strike me as the issue seeing as majority of the problems happen before the os loads </s>
<s> last time the computer was momentarily working i got a computer literate mate of mine to install all new bios and drivers and that wasn t long ago </s>
<s> thanks keep the suggestions coming </s>
