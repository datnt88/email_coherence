<s> i want to max out my gigabyte 7ixe4 motherboard </s>
<s> i currently have a duron 850mhz and want to go up to a 1 4ghz </s>
<s> yes i know it still isn t that fast but getting a new motherboard is not an option </s>
<s> i wanted an athlon thunderbird 1 4ghz but i m not sure if i ll even be able to find one anywhere </s>
<s> there s the duron 1 4ghz but that would require a bios upgrade which i ve never done before and could be risky </s>
<s> my mom also uses this computer for important things so if i were to mess it up it would be hell </s>
<s> there s also the option of an athlonxp but i m not sure if the motherboard will support it </s>
<s> the faq on the gigabyte website says that the board supports duron and athlonxps but on the same website there is a processor compatibility chart that doesn t list any of the xps as compatible </s>
<s> i m not really sure what to do and could use some advice as to the best path </s>
<s> thanks adam </s>
<s> i made this jump 2 years ago </s>
<s> big difference between duron850 and athlon t bird </s>
<s> here is a 1 33 gt gt gt while you should hone up on your knowledge of hardware </s>
<s> i wouldn t recommend a rookie to perform this task </s>
<s> in short </s>
<s> 1 bios update </s>
<s> it s something i ve done many times 2 9 times </s>
<s> and for me has never lost a board </s>
<s> 2 if it doesn t list the xp then it s not going to support it </s>
<s> but did i look at the wrong board at since it lists some xp cpus </s>
<s> 3 i don t see a lot of these cpus out there either </s>
<s> duron but you may want to be sure your power supply has the watts and you also will be fitting a new proper sized cpu heatsink and fan hsf </s>
<s> thanks tharpeli but unfortunately i live in canada </s>
<s> i think i will upgrade my bios and then see what the local tech shop can do </s>
<s> r proffitt i was just curious as to what method you use to upgrade the bios </s>
<s> the gigabyte website has three utilities one updates from the operating system one searches the internet and the other is through dos </s>
<s> i just want some more advice because i really don t want to screw this up </s>
