<s> first of all thanks for taking the time to read this </s>
<s> background i have a linksys 802 11b wireless router from an earthlink dsl modem </s>
<s> about a year ago a bright young woman from compusa set up a wireless network between my old gateway pii 350 desktop win 98 and newer laptop fujitsu e7010 win xp home </s>
<s> everything was working wonderfully and then i bought a new laptop compaq win xp </s>
<s> i only wanted to access the internet at home and was not having any problems until i took the computer to frys local electronics store </s>
<s> i was sitting in the caf and tried to logon to the wireless network there i couldnt get internet access </s>
<s> probably because there wasnt a free network there </s>
<s> when i came home i keep getting the limited no connectivity when trying to get on my own network </s>
<s> when i attempt to repair the connection i keep getting the error regarding unable to renew ip address </s>
<s> the compaq will connect to the internet when i use the ethernet cable however </s>
<s> i have recently switched to firefox downloaded spybot and installed norton antivirus but i wasnt having any problems until coming home from frys </s>
<s> ive tried 1 </s>
<s> 1 is the ssid set to be broadcasted </s>
<s> 2 check for mac filtering </s>
<s> it s the drivers in my case </s>
<s> another card and it works </s>
<s> this is not a hardware issue but the quality of the drivers </s>
<s> a reboot works </s>
<s> but if i release and renew its dead </s>
<s> lesson for me </s>
<s> don t do that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> m g thanks for your reply how do i check these things </s>
<s> are they on the router or the new laptop </s>
<s> i m assuming the new laptop since the old laptop seems to work well wirelessly </s>
<s> chris </s>
<s> bob thanks for the tip but i m still a novice by drivers do you mean repairing xp re installing xp or figuring out the driver for the integrated wireless card in my laptop which i m not sure if i know where that would be </s>
<s> chris </s>
<s> are within the setup program of the router </s>
<s> your manual will tell how to access it from your pc </s>
<s> bob does make the point that connection problems are often fixed by using the latest firmware for the router and again this is in the manual </s>
<s> in my example a card i own the issue is the card s drivers </s>
<s> since there will never be a fix i have choices </s>
<s> complain about it </s>
<s> don t release and renew </s>
<s> use it since it works anyway </s>
<s> how can i share this </s>
<s> you can t fix it unless you go with some other make model and theirs works </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that happened to a couple of laptops i was working on </s>
<s> i m assuming you don t have a secure network </s>
<s> on one of them i simply went to the system restore s earlier time before things started happening </s>
<s> i then quot renewed quot repaired the ipaddress and it worked just fine </s>
<s> on another laptop we actually had to send the laptop back to the manufacturer to get it working </s>
<s> the laptop lost its ability to quot repair quot after the user intalled sp2 </s>
<s> on the first laptop i worked on started having problems after updating the system from ibm </s>
<s> my suggestion is that you don t update os and it looks like you know know how to secure your system without sp2 </s>
<s> good luck </s>
