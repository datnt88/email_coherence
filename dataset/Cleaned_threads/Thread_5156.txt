<s> i just bought a new dell dimension b110 vista capable desktop and it displays mic speech tools in the task bar </s>
<s> can anyone tell me if these are for use with plug in external mic or is there an internal microphone that i need to activate find configure or do something to to make it work </s>
<s> it s something you ll add </s>
<s> my hp has internal mic that s why i posed the question </s>
<s> don t see an internal mic on that one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the pink microphone input port on the computer is just that a place to plug in an external microphone </s>
<s> if the desktop had an internal microphone installed say in the front of the case the desktop case would have to sit on your desktop and you would have to speak into your case </s>
<s> not uncommon with notebooks but on a desktop </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the hp has installed at top of monitor just above the viewing screen </s>
<s> very convenient </s>
<s> by the way i installed an esxternal mic pink port and all is well </s>
