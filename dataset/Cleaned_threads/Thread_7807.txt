<s> here are my system specs intel q9450 dx48bt2 motherboard bios at 1782 2 x 2gb of kingston ram 1 5v each ddr3 1333mhz msi rx3870 t2d512e oc video card v120 driver at 8 43 700 watt thermaltake power supply sound blaster x fi xtremegamer sound card nothing has been touched from factory settings and i have no intention of doing so </s>
<s> i originally had 4x 1gb sticks of ocz ram ddr3 1333 mhz </s>
<s> i these sticks operating at 1 82v my computer trouble is that when i boot the computer for the first time after a long period of being off the computer hangs </s>
<s> it seems to happen a minute after the computer fully boots </s>
<s> this necessitates a press of the reset button </s>
<s> after i press the reset button the computer reboots and everything is ok no more freezing issue </s>
<s> i went through ocz s site and i checked their memory configurator </s>
<s> the dx48bt2 motherboard isn t listed at all on their site so i ordered the kingston ram </s>
<s> even after ordering the kingston ram i still get the hang on the cold boot issue </s>
<s> i have also posted this issue on the ocz boards before i ordered the ram </s>
<s> it was suggested that i don t have a large enough power supply </s>
<s> here is a link to that thread could this hanging on a cold boot be due to the fact that i don t have a large enough capacity on my power supply </s>
<s> if not what might the other possibilities be </s>
<s> thanks for your assistance </s>

<s> i decided to look through the boxes an labeling of the above computer i had built and i noticed on the box of the thermaltake power supply quot dual core support quot no mention of quad cores </s>
<s> i know this may sound like an odd question but do some power supplies work with dual cores but not quads </s>
<s> is where you rma boards and change make models till you get a good one </s>
<s> today those that pick boards may find things that don t work arrive with out of date bios or other issues </s>
<s> the quot sellers quot are often just dispensers for the boxes and not support </s>
<s> i do not have your hardware to play with but share the comment fix </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> check the ram placement for ddr3 setting </s>
<s> verify what slots they go into it maybe for quot pairs quot like in a or b slots or similar color slots that could aslo be like in slots 1 3 the manual should explain this </s>
<s> you wouldn t have seen this problem if all slots were used in your old setup </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> enough to be ready during post </s>
<s> but when you do the restart it s already spinning seen as ready and the system starts normally </s>
<s> try changing the bios for the long or full memory test vs quick memory test and see if that solves the hang on boot at cold start </s>
