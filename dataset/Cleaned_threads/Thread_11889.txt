<s> i just bought a samsung 940bw monitor but it has wavy lines i find out that this is due to an electrical issue </s>
<s> i want to know which device would stop this issue </s>
<s> i have a ups and a voltage regulator what else do i need </s>
<s> i had an identical problem </s>
<s> for me it was interference from a cable tv wire that caused it </s>
<s> i ve unplugged the coaxial and am trying to come up with some other solution </s>
<s> but i find it strange that a coax cable very low voltage well shielded can interfere with a monitor cable </s>
<s> maybe somebody can explain </s>
<s> kees </s>
