<s> hi i have a strange issue last month or so i noticed that the battery level when the adapter was plugged in too indicated 99 and didn t go over that level however if i disconnected the adapter and let the battery level fall under 95 when i plugged it in again it did go to 100 again </s>
<s> after hibernating though it fell to 99 again i thought i might try to calibrate and now it shows 98 and won t go over that level with the adapter plugged in is there an explanation </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> ps i have a gigabyte netbook </s>
<s> you see that as the batteries get old </s>
<s> old is over 18 months </s>
<s> this confounds most owners but not most shops </s>

<s> thank you for the reply </s>
<s> it is just 12 months old this month and i have not used it much on its own </s>
<s> is is better to keep it out when i am using the power adapter </s>
<s> at the office we ve had batteries in for 5 years and found they sometimes get about 50 percent of new batteries </s>
<s> you ll see some odd advice about pulling batteries but this one looks to be a fretful user </s>
<s> nod a lot and let them do what they want </s>
