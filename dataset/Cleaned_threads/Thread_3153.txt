<s> it seems to get power to it as the green light comes on and you can hear the normal spinning noise for a few secs before there is a few clicking sounds </s>
<s> it then repeats the spinning and clicking a few times before stopping all together but stil has the green light on </s>
<s> when you go into the files menu it is not recognised nor does it automatically start the open folder menu as it normally would however the safely remove hardware icon stil appears at the bottom toolbar and the laptop states that the component is working correctly with no fault codes </s>
<s> i ve not to my knowledge dropped or kicked the hard drive nor unplugged it improperly </s>
