<s> put this system together by parting out of 3 win95 based computers </s>
<s> system will be used for retro games office 97 applications out going email and faxing </s>
<s> i have the system running stable that means restarts from win98 shut down menu cause freeze on shut down screen and soft boot during startup pre windows loading cause freeze </s>
<s> i configured the hard drives to be on the same primary ide cable 0 as master 1 as slave and put the cdrom on its own secondary cable as a slave </s>
<s> the system would boot showing the drives as present and working on the next boot the slave drive failed to be recognized </s>
<s> the pattern was hard drives okay good boot and the next boot bad boot un recognized slave drive with reduced computer speed </s>
<s> i re configured the cdrom to be on the same primary ide cable as the master hard drive and put the slave drive on its own secondary cable </s>
<s> the boot with un recognized slave hard drive went away and the system is stable </s>
<s> what is going on here </s>
<s> why cant i get a stable system with the hard drives located on the same ide cable </s>
<s> 1 this was a known issue with some older systems </s>
<s> the cause was most commonly tracked down to a bios issue </s>
<s> see if you can find if it has been updated </s>
<s> 2 another trick i use is to use 80 conductor cables and follow the jumper rules to the letter </s>
<s> there are some that will try non standard jumpering ideas but i leave them to experiment </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will check on the bios version and update if i need to </s>
<s> i will try the 80 wire cable </s>
<s> is this a fix </s>
<s> on top of the wd 8gb drive jumpered as slave there is a note about if used with a 2gb drive a special jumper settings maybe needed and the diagram shows an additional jumper placed on the pins beside the slave pins </s>
<s> ill get the drive model numbers and see if wd has any info on this </s>
<s> get rid of windows 98 unless your that nostalgic </s>
<s> worn out w98 installation cds will cause this because you never get a clean reinstall </s>
<s> the exact same thing happened to me </s>
<s> also reconfigure your jumpers to original setups </s>
<s> just how old is that cpu </s>
<s> i have resolved the problem thanks to you </s>
<s> i decided to use an 80 wire cable instead of the 40 wire ide cable as you indicated </s>
<s> when i pulled the drives out i found a black jumper not visible while drive was in computer as well as the white jumper i installed to set the drive to master </s>
<s> the additional jumper must have been from previous installation of the drive in another computer where the alternate jumper setting was needed </s>
<s> i pulled the jumper off and re installed the drives using the 80 wire ide cable </s>
<s> the drives are working fine now and seem quieter </s>
<s> you gotta say it or the magic won t stick </s>
<s> thanks for the report back and best of continued self made luck </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well it shipped with win95 win3 1 drivers </s>
<s> my guess is 1997 date of manufacture </s>
<s> it was a win95 system when i got it donated as a pen2 later learned it was a pen mmx </s>
<s> i put in a used drive just to see if the system worked at all </s>
<s> 5 years later fix or part out time </s>
<s> so im rebuilding it as retro system </s>
<s> i couldnt get a stable system with the additional drive in the location i wanted </s>
<s> i pulled the drives out i found a black jumper not visible while drive was in computer as well as the white jumper i installed to set the drive to master </s>
<s> i decided to use the 80 wire cable because i wanted to see if it would work </s>
<s> i pulled the jumper off and re installed the drives using the 80 wire ide cable </s>
<s> the drives are working fine now and seem quieter </s>
<s> the system is stable </s>
<s> as to the use of win98se i cant install me because the cpu is below 250 mhz </s>
<s> i have a linux live cd i will try but if you can think of another os please feel free to post </s>
