<s> my gateway has an onboard graphics chip </s>
<s> i wanted to upgrade it so i bought an xfx 8600gt pci express nvideo card </s>
<s> it worked for about 5 months then it died </s>
<s> i could still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip and it worked </s>
<s> next i bought a sapphire 8650 pci express ati card </s>
<s> it worked fine about 3 weeks and then it failed </s>
<s> again i can still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip but of course its graphic capabilities are slow </s>
<s> can my motherboard be frying graphic cards </s>
<s> i am afraid to buy another one for fear it will fry after a couple of days </s>
<s> i returned the xfx card under warranty and eventually they will send me another and i can try that one but who knows how long that will last </s>
<s> anybody has any ideas </s>
<s> my hunch is power supply that you re under powering the system </s>
<s> i recently replaced a stock psu in a gateway </s>
<s> it rated 300w </s>
<s> graphics cards like you re describing may prefer 400 450w </s>
<s> it might be heat too </s>
<s> keep the insides of your tower clean and be sure it s where it can breathe ok </s>
<s> go to gateways web site and go to support select type of computer and find your model </s>
<s> it will list everything about your ride including power supply </s>
<s> most gateways have a 300 watt psu </s>
<s> the fx and a few multi media will have 400 watters </s>
