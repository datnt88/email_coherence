<s> how dangerous is heat to a hard drive </s>
<s> i usually think of heat within a case as being more dangerous to the cpu and possibly mobo components </s>
<s> yet i have a history of hard drive failures that seems inordinately high </s>
<s> i seem to barely get a year out of the average drive </s>
<s> here are the facts of my situation 1 </s>
<s> like all electronic devices heat can kill them </s>
<s> if possible stack them with an air space between </s>
<s> do a google and download speedfan everest or motherboard monitor </s>
<s> free and they will give hd temps </s>
<s> i had the same problem </s>
<s> i also d l and game a lot </s>
<s> i bought a gateway 9310x and after 3 mo </s>
<s> the hard drive failed </s>
<s> got a replacement on warrenty and that one failed roughly 3 mo </s>
<s> later </s>
<s> started to figure out the drive was getting really hot sitting tucked away where there was no air flow </s>
<s> i noticed that after the hard drive had been working a lot ie dowloading from bt overnight the system would run extremley slowly </s>
<s> the hard drive was hot to the touch </s>
<s> i got a new drive about a year ago and its been sitting on top of my comp with a fan purchaced at target blowing on it </s>
<s> i have had no problems since </s>
<s> i just now bought a new case with many fans so hopefully it will work </s>
<s> not quite sure why you are quot tinkering quot and swapping drives but if that is your style of operation i have the following suggestions options 1 the enclosure is designed to route air from the fans to the various heat generators cpu drives etc </s>
<s> if you keep the enclosure off you are destroying the designed air flow patterns </s>
<s> suggest putting the enclosure back in its original configuration even if you use something like ducktape to hold it in place for quick access </s>
<s> 2 if 1 is not to your liking then you need an external fan that is blowing toward the open area of your enclosure </s>
<s> 3 you might want to consider using an external drive s that is are either permanently in place or connected as you need the capability </s>
<s> this would allow you to close the computer as intended by the design and give you various disk options </s>
<s> note heat is the 1 destroyer of electronics </s>
<s> you are seeing it relative to the drives but it is very possible that there are other hot spots in the electronics area that are being stressed </s>
<s> heat will be one factor so putting it on blocks will help air circulation and cooling </s>
<s> sixteen hours a day of use will be about 100 per week which is about 5 000 per year </s>
<s> normal office useage will be less than 2 000 per year so your drive will last less than half as long </s>
<s> i haven t got a spec with me but 10 000 hours rings a bell for long life electroic products </s>
<s> two years should see you through a hard drive if you leave it on all the time and of course longer hours of use will reduce its lifetime anyway wear the same socks for a few weeks and they fall appart </s>
<s> you could try having an alternate drive so you aren t using the same one day after day change drives every time you change socks and see which lasts longest </s>
<s> i do the same things including keeping the cover off </s>
<s> i just put the fan for the front of the case beneath the drive </s>
<s> i aim it to blow air right on the hd </s>
<s> that makes it much cooler to the touch </s>
<s> i don t need the front case fan to blow into the case anymore </s>
<s> with the case off the airflow is not going to be correct anyways </s>
<s> as far as the mainboard or cpu area you can hang a 120v fan for electronics over them </s>
<s> just plug it into the wall </s>
<s> make sure it is for electronics so it does not emit electrical noise into your machine </s>
<s> that s not as nice as leaving some space for cooling </s>
<s> i think you ve found one of the reasons </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i installed a temperature reading software it also reads the speeds of the fans i have three and then checked with hp to confirm the info that the software was giving me </s>
<s> they gave me a recommended operating temp </s>
<s> and i adjusted my setting to that figure </s>
<s> the fans operate automatically as needed </s>
<s> some try to get by with motherboard sensors and in this discussion i see a possible big clue with stacked drives </s>
<s> how do you know you are not heat stressing the drives </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> manfacturers estimates of life expectancy are educated guesses </s>
<s> and of course heat is the enemy of electronics </s>
<s> i have a hot new system pentium d 3 2ghz 2 gb of ram 3 hds and a heater called a graphics card </s>
<s> although my lian li alum case has 4 fans i still get heat warnings from pc probe ii software and wired temperature probes thermaltake hardcano 13 </s>
<s> two of my hds are western digital sata raptors </s>
<s> these fast 10 000 rpm drives are noisy and generate more heat than standard 7200 rpm drives </s>
<s> but hey i love the speed of the raptors </s>
<s> the solution to hd heat and noise </s>
<s> smartdrive 2002 enclosures </s>
<s> these hd enclosures are copper lined copper conducts heat better than plastic alum steel and fit into a 5 25 drive slot visible on front of case like an optical drive </s>
<s> air slots around the smartdrive 2002 enclosure helps remove the heat conducted by the hd </s>
<s> not cheap but an essential part of a quality system </s>
<s> j saale </s>
<s> i must be extreamly lucky </s>
<s> one of my hd s is a western digital wd800jb that i ve had since 2002 and it is in its third computer since new and they all have stayed on 24 hours a day except for power outages </s>
<s> i figure it has over 359 000 of power on time </s>
<s> i have another hd in there an ibm dtla 307045 that has been in there almost 3 years that a friend gave me that came from an old business computer and i ve put over 250 000 of use on it and there is no telling how much use it had before i got it </s>
<s> of course i have a case fan mounted in front of my hd bay antec case </s>
<s> i also have a total of 8 fans in my case including fans on the cpu memory and chipset controled by the digital doc 5 plus i have either 2 or 3 fans in the power supply </s>
<s> louis </s>
<s> i have two dells on my desk </s>
<s> i leave the cases open and have a small 10 fan blowing on them and a ceiling fan going all the time </s>
<s> before i did this they both would really slow down after a couple of hours but now they don t </s>
<s> they re on just about 24 7 but they go into sleep mode if idle for 60 minutes </s>
<s> they re both about 5 years old now and still in pretty good shape and i have yet to have one of them stall or crash on me since i opened the cases and added the fans </s>
<s> one drawback i have is that we also have a spare refrigerator in this room and it generates a lot of heat </s>
<s> i m thinking of adding some kind of partition between my desk and the fridge </s>
<s> can t get rid of the fridge though </s>
<s> once you have a second one you ll never want to go back to just one again </s>
<s> kat </s>
<s> hmmm i am a mechanical design engineer and i design hard drives for a living so i can tell you with some authority that heat is definitely a problem </s>
<s> even if you are not running 10 000 rpm drives it still is a concern because modern drives generally run very tight disk dampers used to control tmr track mis registration and that tends to heat things up quite a bit on several levels </s>
<s> not only is the available air volume reduced inside the drive but the dampers increase the load on the spindle motor which increases the current required to spin the disks increased current means more heat </s>
<s> period </s>
<s> i ve actually burned my fingertip touching the spindle motor transistors on a drive that was running for a long time in a chamber those suckers got really hot </s>
<s> we run the drives at elevated temperatures as part of our on going reliability testing we have to generate the statistical evidence to back up our mtbf ratings for the oems </s>
<s> mtbf is mean time between failures although we have improved exponentially over the years in the area of outgassing the process by which the components inside the drive emit bad stuff which is accelerated by high temperatures </s>
<s> you have experienced outgassing it is the reason that new cars have that quot new car smell quot the plastic components outgass for a while it is still a problem </s>
<s> we have worked to eliminate virtually all the adhesives possible inside the drive and to all but eliminate outgassing from plastic components but it is still there to a degree the spindle motors and actuator pivot bearing are still assembled using adhesives and flex circuit brackets and disk dampers and miscellaneous other components are made out of plastic it is impossible to completely eliminate all the sources of outgassing outgassing ends up contaminating the inside of a drive which is a big problem when the heads are flying just over a millionth of an inch above the disk surface the heads pick up the contaminants and you have head degradation issues the heads don t fly like they re supposed to and the drive eventually stops working so to make a long story short you should be very concerned about keeping your drives as cool as possible mounting them in a 5 25 quot inch bay with a couple of cooling fans mounted in a bezel works well but can be noisy and doesn t help if you don t have available 5 25 quot bays separating the drives so there is some air space between them is critical this also helps with the flux leakage problem where the voice coil motor of some drives actually leaks quite a bit of magnetic flux placing another drive in this magnetic field can cause problems for that drive for 10 000 rpm and 15 000 rpm scsi drives what i primarily use in my computers i try to mount them in a 5 25 quot bay on their backs with the pcb up and keep fans blowing air across them i have a couple of quantum designed maxtor 10 000 rpm scsi drives that have been in constant use for over 6 years now and they are still working flawlessly i have a 10 000 rpm seagate barracuda 9gb drive in my kids computer that is quite a bit older than that and it still works like new anoher piece of advice i would give is to not buy the latest quot bleeding edge quot capacity point drives right now the most margin from a head media standpoint is generally in the 80gb per platter drives so an 80gb single disk or 160gb two disk drive is probably going to be much more reliable than a drive that is 100 or 120gb per platter or even higher as some dsa or pmr drives out there are the head degradation issue will bite you in the butt </s>
<s> do bear in mind that manufacturers calculate cooling airflow etc with the side on </s>
<s> removing it can make any fans etc they fit ineffective and cause more problems especially if in an already hot room </s>
<s> in reply one of the reasons that drives die young is the temp </s>
<s> what can happen is that the magnetic coating on the disc platter can delaminate </s>
<s> the metallic particles have a proclivity to leave the surface thereby causing the disc to be quot bad quot or not readable </s>
<s> this is in direct correlation to the temperature of the drive </s>
<s> and the magnectic permeability is also a function of the temperature as the quot domains quot can flip flop easier at higher temperatures causing random unreadability </s>
<s> i run several computers in a room myself and i always try to keep the temperature down below 70 degrees if not lower </s>
<s> still the internal temperatures of the hard drives can reach over 130 internally </s>
<s> if i allow the temp in the room to go up to over 80 degrees which in a house can happen easily in a closed area from the heat of the computer can cause this temp to raise to over 150 or more not good for hard drives </s>
<s> force air around the casing and area to remove the temp from the casing and inside the casing </s>
<s> it will be noisy but your life of the drives will increase exponentially </s>
<s> why do you think computing centers try to keep the rooms around 50 degrees f </s>
<s> as far as leaving the computer on it is better for the hard drive to stay on all the time if the temp is okay </s>
<s> this way the platter surface is not heating and cooling which causes delamination also </s>
<s> it is called heat cycling which can cause a hard drive to fail rapidly </s>
<s> it also subjects the motor and arm to startup forces and shut down forces which is the hardest on the drives rather than running in a constant state </s>
<s> the heads do not contact the surface but fly over them at a very small distance now some less than 1 millionith of an inch and the heads are actually very aerodynamic and fly like an airplane </s>
<s> that airplane wants to be constant with no bumps and no speed changes for best flight </s>
<s> now a caveat that is if the temp of the drive and area is okay </s>
<s> if it is excessive then by all means turn it off </s>
<s> but the surface of a platter is rather sensitive to temp differentials as is the media </s>
<s> remember that platter is spinning trying to distort the platter and throw off the media every chance that it gets </s>
<s> i have had hard drives running for over 5 years now that i have kept cool and they run perfect even though they have small capacities </s>
<s> i have had new ones die in one day </s>
<s> the safest drives are the ones that run at 5400 rpm because they do not have the forces on them that the higher speed ones do including heat stress </s>
<s> slower is cooler </s>
<s> i have a couple of patents on discs and had to study a lot of the failure patterns of the devices </s>
<s> faster is hotter and therefore requires more cooling </s>
<s> if you can get a fan right on top of the disc and blow cool air that is best </s>
<s> there are some fans that slide in between the discs and move the air they help </s>
<s> blowing cold air into the case really helps </s>
<s> so if you are near a vent in your house try routing cold air to the computer </s>
<s> if you can get portable room air conditioner and blow the cold air right into the computer make sure that it also is dehumidified </s>
<s> that mathematics behind modern discs are astronomical </s>
<s> the speed and flight path can cause several misreads of the information and that is corrected by extreme mathematics and bit control </s>
<s> try and help the computer and disc out by keeping it at a constant cool temp </s>
<s> keldawwg ssedlymayrvery impressive dissertations on the whole harddrive subject </s>
<s> geewiz makes me feel that everything i might have believed about hard drives was wrong </s>
<s> interesting idea about turning the hd so the pcb is face up </s>
<s> never would have dreamed of doing that </s>
<s> must be like eating a peanut butter sandwich with the wonder bread turned ass backwards </s>
<s> makes sense from a cooling stand point though </s>
<s> and i m sure the hd has no idea that it s inverted and will read and write the same </s>
<s> as far as using small capacity slower speed drives i m not sure that s practical for most people today </s>
<s> where it makes since from a temperature and drive reliability standpoint it may not in other ways </s>
<s> for one you d likely wind up with more drives in your system more combined heat to compensate for the lesser storage capacity of the individual drives </s>
<s> but hey i guess life is filled with compromises </s>
<s> leaving space between the drives is a great idea </s>
<s> sometimes the obvious things are the ones that we tend to skip over </s>
<s> and best of all this one bit of technology that wont cost me a thing to implement </s>
<s> lastly should your drive be hot to the touch after normal use </s>
<s> i mean obviously it would be warm </s>
<s> but should it be uncomfortable to hold in your hand immediately after turning your system off </s>
<s> i just bought a seagate momentus drive for my laptop that uses new technology that should help both for heat and impact data stability </s>
<s> it s called quot perpendicular recording technology quot the new drives are still a bit more expensive but worth a look </s>
<s> their 5400 speed recommended due to heat by some posting here is actually almost as fast as a 7200 rpm drive </s>
<s> here is a link with some of the basic explan </s>
<s> thanks keldawwg that was very enlightening </s>
<s> i have a few questions though </s>
<s> you mentioned head degradation as being a leading cause of hd failure </s>
<s> is there any way to clean the heads of contaminants </s>
<s> as for heat being destructive what do you recommend for a temperature margin for most drives </s>
<s> finally i was intrigued by your statement that right now the most margin from a head media standpoint is generally in the 80gb per platter drives </s>
<s> does that mean that those of us with big fat 250 300 gb hd are only signing ourselves up for a world of hurt </s>
<s> thanks a bunch </s>
<s> i recently built my new pc and changed most of stock stuff </s>
<s> the cpu fan thermaltake </s>
<s> moved the internal fans where they would blow sensibly </s>
<s> left the side off </s>
<s> had overheating problems </s>
<s> my temp readings when nothing was running was 109f cpu mobo 94f the hd s were hot to the touch as were some of the mobo chips </s>
<s> had some doom3 lockups </s>
<s> went to walmart 9 95 fan put it next to the pc </s>
<s> small desk printer is next to pc fan between cpu now at 92f and mobo 79f and the tracking during quake 4 shows only an increase of approx 8 to 10 deg on both </s>
<s> now my problem is that the fan is too close to the pc </s>
<s> the motor creates a mag field and is picked up by the vid card asus ax850xt 256mb and the upper left corner of my monitor has a pulse like a bad florescent light but only slightly </s>
<s> turn off fan and it stops </s>
<s> so am trying to figure a way to move the fan or block the mag field may try a grounded wire mesh </s>
<s> just dont have much room to move stuff </s>
<s> sooo try a large desktop fan </s>
<s> will drop your temps a lot </s>
<s> hd s are running cooler too </s>
<s> ted </s>
<s> i downloaded quot speed fan quot free after article about it in pc world </s>
<s> it determined that i have three fans and the program reads the speed of each fan and the temperature i assume in each fan area </s>
<s> i conferred with hp who confirmed that i do have three fans and that the operating temperature should be 90deg c </s>
<s> the program allows you to change fan speed and re set the operating temperature range </s>
<s> i did both of those things reducing 100 power to the fans to reduce the noise and reset the temperatures per hb s notice </s>
<s> they now will come on and run when the upper temperature limits are reached this is rare and all seems well </s>

<s> as i type my reply i can look to my left and see my old dell xps d300 </s>
<s> i bought it november 1997 it has been on almost constantly since then </s>
<s> i came with a western digital 4 gb scsi drive and i added a 9 gb drive shortly there after </s>
<s> these are 7200 rpm drives which was the state of the art then </s>
<s> i have my power options set to never turn off the hard disks i run all my pc stock and i have have no problems </s>
<s> if you buy an external drive like a firewire drive make sure you get one with a cooling fan </s>
<s> i never bought the idea of quot convection cooling quot my data </s>
<s> i bought a non fan cooled 250 gig drive and couldn t believe how hot that thing got </s>
<s> yet a separate enclosure with the same drive only this time fan cooled was barely warm </s>
<s> convection cooling simply won t work in the long haul and thinking about how many times i lost data due to cpu crashes etc i m not going to risk not having a fan to save a few bucks </s>
<s> recently i had yet another dell ecc memory meltdown which put me into the position of not having backed up every single thing on my computer </s>
<s> funny how you realize how much you need some of the files once you can t get at them </s>
<s> couldn t find the rambus memory locally so i removed the ide drive from the dell popped it into an avastor hdx firewire enclosure and was able to access the files on the new system i had to buy </s>
<s> got lucky that this worked </s>
<s> try putting up one of those self mounting wall shelves just big enough to hold the fan about 3 feet away from the computer </s>
<s> if the fan is on the same piece of furniture or within a couple of feet of the computer you ll get the screen interference every time </s>
<s> and if you have that flickering on your screen even if it s faint it can cause a migraine headache or seizure </s>
<s> be careful </s>
<s> dust acts as an insulator and when you leave the side of your computer off you will expose the system to an increased amount of dust </s>
<s> many components will overheat as the result of excessive dust collecting on them </s>
<s> as a result you system will run slower and may shorten the life of your system </s>
<s> just give the inside a good vacuum every so often and that will do wonders </s>
<s> make sure that you are grounded when you do this or you could end up with a 8220 kentucky fried computer 8221 </s>
<s> of course dust isn 8217 t an issue when it comes to your hard drive but as stated above it will affect your system if left unchecked </s>
<s> good point </s>
<s> i also always put the soft brush extension on the end of my vacuum hose just in case i get too close </s>
<s> i try to get within a 1 4 inch or so of the components but you have to be very careful </s>
<s> by using the soft brush extension it prevents the hard edge of the vacuum hose from ever contacting any of the components if accidentally i get too close </s>
<s> i am totally computer challenged so my advice is just a simple quot home cure quot remedy </s>
<s> the only computer i have or use is a laptop and sometimes i leave it on for a long period </s>
<s> i was worried about the drive heat also as they do get so hot </s>
<s> i sometimes had cd drive failure which i thought was because the cd got so hot so i put my computer on a woven wooden hotplate mat one that is open weave so air can circulate on top of a shortlegged cookie rack </s>
<s> on warm days i keep a floor fan circulating in the area of my computer other times i keep a small desk fan close to the computer </s>
<s> since doing that my computer stays only warm to the touch </s>
<s> think putting your laptop on your lap or any flat surface only can add to the heat concentration </s>
<s> just find a way to raise it an inch or so </s>
<s> you re not lucky </s>
<s> you re just smart but perhaps you didn t realise it yet </s>
<s> herer s my story </s>
<s> 1 5 years ago my notebook hd of 20gb was as full as possible </s>
<s> and my external hd of 70gb was acting weird </s>
<s> so i thought i d buy a wd250gb </s>
<s> some people warned me not to buy a maxtor now seagate fyi </s>
<s> so the wd was a good buy </s>
<s> it kept running almost 24 7 for several months </s>
<s> after a while i thought i might buy a second external hd as a backup for my wd </s>
<s> the wd was sold out so i thought why not buy a lacie that looked real cool </s>
<s> it was also a 250gb </s>
<s> however when i plugged it in my pc i saw it had a maxtor in it </s>
<s> being warned b4 i hoped it would last </s>
<s> however it didn t last longer than 3 months and gave bad cluster warnings </s>
<s> i don t think this was coincidence the lacie with the maxtor drive in it was always very warm no metal case but a plastic case barely bigger than a 2 5 quot hd while the wd had an alu case that was very cool the case was also some 80 bigger so if you re gonna buy an external hd watch out what s in it </s>
<s> also some do it yourself hd cases do not have a fan in the kit </s>
<s> even if they gave me a maxtor seagate for free i wouldn t want it </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> and btw my western digital is still running almost 20h a day </s>
<s> i must be missing something </s>
<s> are there temp sensors attached to hard drives cpu etc </s>
<s> how does a temp sensing software get it s temp data </s>
<s> don t you need sensors installed on the components to read temp fan speeds etc </s>
<s> pud </s>
<s> i have read 29 messages about hot </s>
<s> i live in phoenix and i know how hot is </s>
<s> how hot should a mobo and a hd and a cpu be in degrees f </s>
<s> heat is actually pretty dangerous for all components of a computer </s>
<s> reason being is that they all will produce heat </s>
<s> not only that the harddrives like other components have a silicon board with transistors and other electrical components that could easily be harmed by heat </s>
<s> 1 the amount of time your computer is fine just make sure you have adequate cooling </s>
<s> 2 when a pc is idle its true that it has minimal read and write but in the end it is still spinning wear and tear will still occur </s>
<s> 3 downloading and gaming again requires you to have adequate cooling </s>
<s> 4 leaving your case open is actually bad for your cooling here is why a computer case is designed to be closed to maximize air flow from teh front to the back of the case </s>
<s> however because the computer cae is now open the cool air cannot cool the components effectively because it is now escaping from the side </s>
<s> close the case every time increase the fans to a higher cfm or increase the case size </s>
<s> remember air must go from the front to the back </s>
<s> this way you do not have a pocket of hot air hovering over components </s>
<s> if you want to see what i mean then go ahead put a thermometer and compare when it is open and when its closed </s>
<s> 5 this is also a problem many ide and sata drives produce alot of heat and because of heat transferrance will continue to generate heat </s>
<s> depending on your case you have a number of options </s>
<s> 1 add a 120mm fan to the front near your harddrives some cases have this option some don t 2 get a bigger case the bigger the case the more drive bays given in most cases you can split them up </s>
<s> 3 use only the drive you need and use a harddrive enclosure for the rest of them </s>
<s> 6 discharging yourself against the case is fine you really don t have to worry about static </s>
<s> concluding from your facts i would say the main problem is that your harddrives are too close together and the case is open </s>
<s> again the case has to be closed for the fans in the computer to be effective cool air is sucked in from the front or the side if you have a side panel fan and jetted through the power supply and rear fans </s>
<s> i was looking at one of the responses in adding a 10 dollar fan </s>
<s> yes it can work only if you re careful though when you accelerate the fan to such a high cfm and no filters you can get a dust collection on your motherboard which with high humidity will cake onto your board making things even worse </s>
<s> so keep your case closed try and split the drives and increase the airflow in the case tip increase the air flow going out the back of your computer it will help remove all the hot air faster </s>
<s> hope that helps </s>
<s> chris t </s>
<s> yeah i noticed the flicker moved the fan about 12 inches no problem now </s>
<s> it sits on top of my printer since i have no room otherwise </s>
<s> hi i have an acer aspire 5028wlmi laptop and just recently been shutting itself off without warning and so i thought this might have something to do with the cpu overheating i donwloaded a programme to test the temp and my laptop is normaly in the range of 55 degrees c and 90 degrees c i dont think this is normal but i want to be sure </s>
<s> appreciate any guidance </s>
<s> up until about a week ago i never actually knew hard drives failed all that often </s>
<s> i ve had the same hard drive in my older computer since it was brand new 8 years ago </s>
<s> it has some older ibm branded hard drive </s>
<s> i know i didn t do anything special to keep it working cuz i had to open the case for the first time about 2 years after it was new and found all the fuzz and lint from my new carpet covering everything inside like a sweater </s>
<s> i opened it cuz i noticed the fan didn t sound right anymore </s>
<s> but either way its still working perfectly fine after 8 years my newer computer s hd just failed its only about 4 yrs old and it has a samsung spinpoint hd the recovery portion of the hd was damaged i guess </s>
<s> idk </s>
<s> i m switching from pata to sata tomorrow stupid hp didn t tell me they were sending sata as a replacement and now i have to go buy the cable arg atleast the motherboard and power supply support sata2 </s>
<s> i would say don t move it around too much my computers basically just sit on the floor next to my desk and i ve always got it on 24 7 never sleeps or anything generally with windows and games still running just paused </s>
<s> don t tinker they re fragile and apparently they can break easily which i never knew lol </s>
<s> for someone who s supposed to be a semi professional of sorts i m not sure what in some of your info is incorrect </s>
<s> keeping the side case open in expectations of cooling the cpu is misleading </s>
<s> the case and fans are designed and engineered to run a certain flow of fresh air in to cool and fresh air out of the case </s>
<s> by removing the side panel your in effect completely throwing off the designed air flow pattern which could be as harmful as running the fan at half speed </s>
<s> secondly the advice of not using free antivirus programs is possibly self serving </s>
<s> granted some of the free av programs out there are inherently harmful as they capture users by allowing trojans spyware malware into the system unbeknownst to the user who s expecting protection </s>
<s> programs such as avast avg and others are just as good if not better than many of the paid type programs such as the misleading norton 360 and even trend micro inclusive packages </s>
<s> if this is your best advice and your portraying yourself as an expert you need to do some reading and give better and more appropriate advise </s>
