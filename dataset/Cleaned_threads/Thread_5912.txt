<s> bought a hard drive and a external enclosure yesterday i set the hard drive to master as shown in the instructions and installed it in the enclosure </s>
<s> i have two computers one with xp home and one with me on it when i plugged the hard drive into either of the two machines the drivers were installed automatically and the hard drive showed up in the device manager of both machines as this device is working properly however the hard drive does not show up in the c drive of either of the two machines </s>
<s> also i have both usb2 and firewire connections and have tried both and have checked their stasis in the device manager as well and they also show as working properly </s>
<s> this is the first time i have tried to get an external hard drive working and i thought that it was plug and play anyways any help that anyone could give or if someone could explain the steps that i am missing would be greatly appreciated </s>

<s> i don t think it the hard disk should show up until you partition and format some space </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> do you know of a link that would explain how to find the hard drive so that i can format it also i ran a couple of tests at seagate and the online tests that could detect the external hard drive said that it was working normaly </s>
<s> any advice you could give would be appreciated </s>
<s> for windows me it s a bit scary for some since we get to boot windows run fdisk and create a partition </s>
<s> formatting can then occur after a reboot with explorer </s>
<s> for windows xp it s in the start help and support so there is no need for me to tell you to look anywhere else </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
