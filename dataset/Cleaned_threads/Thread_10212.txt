<s> i had bought a dell computer a while back </s>
<s> ive changed out a lot of parts but the mobo has only pci slots </s>
<s> i have a pentium 4 and on newegg ive looked at some mobo that only say pentium </s>
<s> if it fits the same slot would the processor work </s>
<s> having the same slot doesn t guarantee compatibility </s>
<s> what dell model do you have </s>
<s> what s your goal </s>
<s> im hoping to upgrade my computers ram and graphic card slots </s>
<s> all it has are 2 184 slots </s>
<s> and then 2 pci slots </s>
<s> i want to be able to upgrade my graphics to pci express and 4gb of ram </s>
<s> a 2004 dimension desktop </s>
<s> it has a pentium 4 processor </s>
<s> i don t know what slot size </s>
<s> what do i look for to find that out </s>
<s> a computer model number is something like quot dell dimension 8400 quot what s yours </s>
<s> once you know the model number you can enter it or the dell service tag at support dell com to get the rest of the info </s>
<s> cpu z and everest home edition are utilities you can download to learn your motherboard make model number </s>
<s> this is all moot imo because there have been so many computer developments over since 2004 that you really will want to purchase or build an entirely new system </s>
