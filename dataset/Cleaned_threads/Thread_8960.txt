<s> i recently uninstalled a zip drive </s>
<s> since then i cannot read from the a drive or my cd or dvd drives </s>
<s> obviously i have disturbed something but cannot figure out what </s>
<s> all cables are in place </s>
<s> can anyone help please </s>
<s> the drives show up in windows as normal but on every one of the drives i get the error message the disk in drive </s>
<s> is not formatted </s>
<s> do you want to format it now </s>
<s> whenever i try to use it </s>
<s> it s a win 2k machine </s>
<s> many thanks squiggles </s>
<s> but the bios was probably setup so that it was seen as the a drive possibly which is normally a floppy drive on the floppy controller as oppised to the ide controller </s>
<s> this was probably done in the bios by disabling the normal floppy </s>
<s> look in your bios to see if the floppy is enabled and set to be a 1 44 mb drive </s>
<s> many thanks for trying ray </s>
<s> i ve had a look </s>
<s> it s set up correctly in there listed as floppy drive 1 44mb </s>
<s> i just don t understand why this has affected all 3 drives </s>
<s> was the zip drive on </s>
<s> how was it jumpered master or slave </s>
<s> who is the mfr of the harddrive </s>
<s> some use different jumpering if the drive is the only one on the cable and if there is a second drive on the same cable </s>
<s> removing one could foul up that </s>
<s> and of course you one of humans was inside the computer </s>
<s> we humans usually are found to be the cause of such problems at least 95 of the time and in the physical area that we penetrated </s>
<s> based on over 30 years of troubleshooting </s>
<s> check all your cables connections </s>
<s> if you already did that do it again </s>
<s> two incidents in these forums in the last two weeks where the poster said they had checked everything </s>
<s> when they checked again the system booted up with zero problems </s>
<s> did you tell us what op sys you were using </s>
<s> if you have all of the drivers you might delete the enum key in the registry and reboot and let windows find the hardware again </s>
<s> it won t find the zip this time </s>
<s> don t do this without further discussions </s>
<s> ok thanks ray </s>
<s> point taken about checking and double checking then checking once again </s>
<s> here is as much as i can tell you o s win 2k i have changed no jumper settings at all </s>
<s> i have changed no motherboard connections at all my physical top drive is a dvd rom samsung dvd rom st 616t </s>
<s> next is my cd writer reader hl dt st cd rw 8400b </s>
<s> both of these are on the same cable alone with no others and both are jumpered on the first setting </s>
<s> fd is on its own cable alone </s>
<s> i have tried putting everything back the way it was but that did not work </s>
<s> im at the stage now that i wanted to be </s>
<s> dvd rom cd writer reader and fd all in and no zip drive </s>
<s> the zip drive was on the same cable as the hd and was jumpered as a slave i dont think there is anything else i can tell you except that the hd is 74 5gb of which 19 8 gb is free </s>
<s> the details that i can make out are maxtor 6l080j4 this is working absolutely fine </s>
<s> the bios is reading the a drive correctly </s>
<s> i have tried leaving a disk in all 3 drives when rebooting </s>
<s> to add to the conundrum this is what happens on startup if i leave disks in the drives </s>
<s> the a drive does not read at all </s>
<s> the dvd and the cd drives will do a listing i can get at txt files on both but i cannot play a cd dvd </s>
<s> now if i remove the cd and the dvd disks that i left in on reboot and put them back in i get the error message i was talking about the disk in drive </s>
<s> is not formatted </s>
<s> do you want to format it now </s>
<s> whenever i try to use any of them </s>
<s> so it is now happening on all 3 drives </s>
<s> regards squiggles </s>
<s> from the control panel system device manager </s>
<s> check to be sure that the ide channels are enabled </s>
<s> they may be recognized properly but if not enabled in device manager they will not work </s>
<s> best of luck </s>
