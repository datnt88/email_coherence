<s> hi i am looking for an hdtv tuner or someway to watch tv on my computer </s>
<s> i prefer not to actually buy the service like cable and pay monthly but to rather pick up some local channels </s>
<s> here are my comp specs 2 8ghz p4 1024mb pc3200 geforce ti 4600 qdi sis superb4fx motherboard </s>
<s> broadband i know that if i buy a tv tuner card thingie it ll most likely be from either ati or nvidia i think </s>
<s> also can a tv tuner card like run with my other card </s>
<s> i m not looking for sli or anything just wondering if i can use both at the same time </s>
<s> thanks in advance ibrhaim jadoon </s>
<s> well there are basicaly 2 cards one from ati a hdtv tuner card and one from hauppauge </s>
<s> since you have a nvidia video card i would say the hauppauge card </s>
<s> to realy use the ati hdtv card you need a ati video card but they are esaer to find in stores than the hauppauge card </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> alright thank you very much but i have a question </s>
<s> i would need an hdtv antenna to watch hdtv right </s>
<s> you do need a good antenna the ati comes with a uhf antenna </s>
<s> since most hdtv stations are in the uhf band a good uhf antenna </s>
<s> how good depends on how far you are from the transmitters </s>
<s> i live about 15 miles away and use an antenna that is good for 50 miles on regular tv and get good results most of the time </s>
<s> at this point in time the ati card drivers are still a work in progress works with xp ok xpmce however still leaves a lot to be desired </s>
<s> the hauupauge drivers are more stable </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> thank you sooooo much ibrahim jadoon </s>
