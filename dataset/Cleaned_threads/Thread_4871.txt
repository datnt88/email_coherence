<s> first let me say i m very impressed with the knowledge of the members here </s>
<s> last weeks question about sharing files and printer between pcs prompted my own question </s>
<s> i have a mac g4 os 10 2 hooked up to a hp smartjet printer </s>
<s> i also have a fujitsu laptop pc running xp pro </s>
<s> they re both on a linksys wireless network </s>
<s> my question is does anyone know if it s possible to share files and the printer between the mac and my laptop </s>
<s> if so how would i go about doing that </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> hi rhender105 yes it is possible to setup file sharing between the 2 over your network </s>
<s> windows isnt very quot friendly quot with non windows computers so your non windows computers have to trick windows into thinking its just another windows pc </s>
<s> the way this is done is via samba </s>
<s> samba is used in linux and macosx environments to allow sharing of files </s>
<s> i dont have the exact instructions for macosx but i m sure apple s website provides good information about it i ve seen it there somewhere before </s>
<s> i may not be a macosx user currently but i use linux which both run off unix environment and they use a lot of the same technics and programs </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> select a folder to share on the xp machine say my documents and share it </s>
<s> go to the mac and quot connect to server quot and you should see the xp machine there </s>
<s> double click enter the username of the xp user and the password and it should just connect </s>
<s> i connect to a w2k machine with no problem </s>
<s> hope this helps too p </s>
<s> mrmacfixit thanks for the advice </s>
