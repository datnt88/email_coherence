<s> i just purchased an hp n7060m media center pc </s>
<s> and boy it s a chore adding other xp compatible software to it </s>
<s> i guess hp does not want you to add your own collection of xp compatible software products to it </s>
<s> since it will not recognize my cakewalk music creator 2003 software does anybody have a suggestion of another music type creator software product that i can buy that will work with the hp n7060m </s>
<s> thanks r </s>
<s> what do you mean quot wont recognize my cakewalk music creator 2003 software quot </s>
<s> what error do you get </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> perhaps it is because of check to see if you have direct x 9 type in run dxdiag then click ok or maybe register and ask cakewalk support about that problem </s>
<s> what exactly is hapening with cakewalk music creator 2003 please be aware that it is most likely not a hp issue </s>
<s> i can probably help you </s>
<s> here is one suggestion on the cakewalk forum the thread is related to the version of direct x that you have installed </s>
<s> for reference the 7060 comes with dx9 as is standard with windows xp sp2 and media center 2005 basicly windows xp pro with sp2 </s>
<s> i would search cakewalk s user support forum for help with their products </s>
<s> thanks for your suggestion and it worked to a point </s>
<s> i got cakewalk creator 2003 to load onto my hp m7060n system however the recording function does not work </s>
