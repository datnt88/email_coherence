<s> hi i have been wanting to copy computer audio to a wav or mp3 file on my dell 866 mhz computer </s>
<s> my system is running a creative soundblaster live </s>
<s> value card that shipped with the system in july 2000 so i first took a standard audio cable with two male ends i guess they might be called </s>
<s> i put one end in the sound out speaker port on the back of the tower and the other in the microphone port </s>
<s> then i played the quicktime file of which i wanted the audio to be copied and pressed record in the windows 98se sound recorder </s>
<s> i had had the volume control was muted as someone was sleeping </s>
<s> when i unmuted the volume control no sound workednot even a system beep or alert </s>
<s> i tried new speakers still no sound </s>
<s> did i fry the sound card </s>
<s> so i replaced the 2000 live </s>
<s> value with a 1997 soundblaster live </s>
<s> no quot value quot facet from my dell 266 mhz </s>
<s> windows of course automatically installed some generic creative sound drivers and then system sound workedbeeps alerts and even all games i tested </s>
<s> but the audio of my dvd player software cinemaster software that came with my 2000 shipped with hardware decoder now made by ravisant cifelli did not work </s>
<s> i even tried downloading drivers from but to no avail for my dvd </s>
<s> did i really fry my original live </s>
<s> value card by using that cable </s>
<s> what should i do regarding the dvd software </s>
<s> i am first off going to try to reinstall the software itself and also the drivers for the decoder card </s>
<s> thanks for all your help </s>
<s> it s greatly appreciated </s>
<s> henry </s>
<s> to give a sound card last rites i boot up a knoppix cd and test the functions </s>
<s> as to the dvd i must write that i can t help you with your dvd decoder board issues </s>
<s> that technology was nice but can strain support and i don t want to deal with them anymore </s>
<s> we install a new dvd drive 20 bucks in bulk and then a software player </s>
<s> somewhere past 600mhz dvd playback via all software began ot work </s>
<s> there are a few that cling to the hardware cards and we let them cling but find it best to pretend we know nothing about them </s>
<s> it s not that we don t it s the hours making it work is costly then they want you to fix it everytime it breaks again for free </s>
<s> so the standing order is to quot know nothing quot hope this sheds some light on the issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> would you please tell me a little bit about knoppix cd and how i might go about getting a copy so that i can test my presumed quot dead quot sound card </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> here s a short review worth reading </s>
<s> links to the knoppix website are there but i must ask since i always want to know </s>
<s> why couldn t you find the knoppix web site </s>
<s> just wondering please tell and don t take it as an offence </s>
