<s> hello i am trying to get devices on 2 different routers connected and networked together </s>
<s> i ll describe the setup internet comes into the home via an actiontec 2000 wireless broadband router located in basement </s>
<s> connected to the actiontec 2000 are tv set top box pvr wired connection desktop pc running win 7 wired connection wireless devices that are brought into the basement ie </s>
<s> laptops or smartphones etc would be connected to the actiontec as well </s>
<s> dlink xtreme n wireless router wired connection from actiontec is plugged into the internet plugin on back of dlink </s>
<s> to the dlink i have connected xbox 360 wired connection laptop win xp wireless connection laptop win 7 wireless 2 blackberries wireless connection the ip address for the actiontec is 192 168 1 254 ips it gives out to the devices connected to it are 192 168 1 xx </s>
<s> the ip address of the dlink is 192 168 0 1 and the range it gives out to devices are 192 168 0 xxx is there a way to configure the routers and or the devices to all exist on the same network </s>
<s> i have access to both of the routers admin settings as well can adjust the ip settings of the devices as well </s>
<s> if more information is needed i can provide thanks so much for reading and for any help </s>
<s> thanks david </s>
<s> i would not have used the wan port of the second router but you can google how by the following phrase </s>
<s> quot how to use a router as a wap quot bob </s>
<s> hi bob thanks for your reply </s>
<s> i actually fixed it by doing what you said </s>
<s> i unplugged the wan port connection on the dlink and put it in one of the lan ports </s>
<s> now everything is talking together and on the same ip address range </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> david </s>
<s> it s a common network setup some call it a trick </s>
<s> but it s something you keep on hand for those special setups </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi all i don t suppose it is possible to do this via a wireless connection </s>
<s> i have a similar issue where i have my modem downstairs which is connected to the internet and also to the sky box via ethernet </s>
<s> my laptop and phone are connected via wireless </s>
<s> i also have a modem with an external hard drive plugged into the usb port upstairs which may also connect to my bluray player via ethernet </s>
<s> basically i want to be able to connect my wireless devices to the modem upstairs which in turn speaks to the modem downstairs so i can access the internet </s>
<s> is this possible </s>
<s> if someone could point me towards a tutorial that would be amazing as you can see my terminology isn t up to spec enough to know what to search for </s>
<s> i would start a new post </s>
<s> and how i solved that was to add a powerline network bridge and setup the other router as a wap </s>
<s> no new tech involved </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok i ll start it in a new thread thanks for the advice </s>
