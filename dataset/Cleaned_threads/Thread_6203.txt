<s> i m looking for the right approach on adding some devices to my home network </s>
<s> i have a dual band netgear wndr3700 router running both g and n that router is downstairs but my son has his laptop xbox and new desktop in his bedroom with no wired ethernet </s>
<s> at first i was just going to buy a wireless n adaptor for his desktop but then thought we d be better off with a wireless access point and then connect each of his three devices to it with gigabit ethernet </s>
<s> does that seem like the right solution </s>
<s> if so what access points support n and gigbit ethernet </s>
<s> if that is not viable then which netgear wireless adaptor will give the best performance </s>
<s> seems like a pci card will give better performance than a usb adaptor </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> after some research i figured what i m looking for is a wireless bridge </s>
<s> i d prefer a netgear bridge because intuitively i feel like it will just quot work better quot than another brand with my netgear wireless router </s>
<s> however the netgear wn2000rpt is only single band n and 100mb ethernet while the linksys wet610n and the d link dap 1522 are both dual band n and 1gb ethernet </s>
<s> having 1gb ethernet is preferable so i can blast files between the two computers connected to the bridge </s>
<s> which do you think is a better solution </s>
<s> any ideas welcome </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i am going to assume you are running g on 2 4 and n on 5 on your dual band router </s>
<s> although you can set the 2 4 to g and n it will not really run both at the same time </s>
<s> that is part of the reason to run 2 radios and separate the n and g although you can run 2 band on only n if all your equipment supports it </s>
<s> your best bet is to get rid of all your g stuff or make sure all your equipment that is going to run n can run at 5g which almost always means it is dual band </s>
<s> be careful what you buy a bridge is just that it converts the ethernet port to wireless and allows it to connect to another router </s>
<s> they in general do not allow wireless client pc to connect to them </s>
<s> you could place a second router behind </s>
<s> there are things called wireless extenders that are wireless in and out </s>
<s> they tend to be a challenge to setup because of all the radio bands and wpa keys </s>
<s> if you are transferring wireless to wireless do not expect any great performance </s>
<s> having a gig port does not mean a lot when you look at n running 300m </s>
<s> the 300m number is some lab thing that nobody gets </s>
<s> then if both machines are on the same frequency the 300m is divided by 2 since the it is shared so you are down to 150m </s>
<s> even then it is nowhere close to 150m </s>
<s> the only way to get wireless to wireless speed is to transfer one machine on 5g and another on 2 4 and then in a lab you might get 300m </s>
<s> gig ports are mostly just marketing garbage on consumer routers </s>
<s> even if you go ethernet to ethernet with cable you will get nowhere near 1g </s>
<s> you have to use a feature called jumbo frames to make it work which is not supported on most consumer routers </s>
<s> also the gig port in most pc s is built into the chipsets and have a limit of 400m </s>
<s> you need a motherboard than is designed with a port to really run gig and these are mostly used for servers </s>
