<s> i have a gateway 830gm </s>
<s> pentium 4 windows xp home </s>
<s> after power failure when i push the big button the cd drive lights flash the hard drive light is on and the processor fan kicks in as normal </s>
<s> usually the processor fan slows down and the monitor comes on and everything proceeds from there </s>
<s> now the processor fan runs on high without slowing </s>
<s> the monitor never wakes up and the hard drive light stays on </s>
<s> no sounds nothing but the fan running at full speed </s>
<s> i am plugged into a surge protector </s>
<s> thought it would help </s>
<s> tried unplugging the hard drive and plugging it back in </s>
<s> same with all the drives </s>
<s> there is a little green light on the motherboard </s>
<s> is my processor fried </s>
<s> how can i test it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> yank out cord to psu and push power button reconnect </s>
<s> what fried hmm lots of things we can t tell by reading your picture </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> unfortunely it could be anything </s>
<s> the meer fact the hds etc </s>
<s> spin up suggests a possible cpu or ram module failure </s>
<s> you didn t offer any beep sequence or such thus you really can t trust anything </s>
<s> if you got warranty use it </s>
<s> disconnect all cd hd drive cables to include power </s>
<s> try to reboot and if bios displays enter it and allow only to boot from fd first device </s>
<s> use a bootable floppy </s>
<s> if it does that great add devices back in </s>
<s> if no display then liekly cpu or mtrbd </s>
<s> itself is at fault </s>
<s> posssble bad capacitors scenerio or bad p s unit </s>
<s> i suggest you test device on another system if possible one at a time only and proceed from there </s>
<s> no fancy testing just swap and test </s>
<s> swap ram modules install only one to see if that s it </s>
<s> any beeps etc </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
