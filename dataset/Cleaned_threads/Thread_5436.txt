<s> i have a t3312 e machine </s>
<s> on the machine it used 512mb ddr 1 512mb 400mhz pc3200 </s>
<s> i am going to buy superram ddr 400 but i will only have one 512mb ram not two part number mpxc22d 38kt3r after googling i found this as a compatible specs for ram on the t3312 </s>
<s> the t3312 ram and superram are both ddr ram 400 mhz pc3200 184 pin unbuffed and non ecc </s>
<s> the difference is their voltage t3312 2 6v superram 2 5v cas latency t3312 3 superram 2 2 2 5 2 5 3 3 7 and type t3312 184 pin dimm superram 184 pin ddr sdram lt i am not sure about the last part gt can i install the superram into this computer </s>

<s> thank you for directing me to this website </s>
<s> i guess the question i am asking is can you mix ram with different voltage cas latency and if dimm and ddr sd ram can work together </s>
<s> comes to ram i do all possible not to mix brands speeds timing or voltages i prefer to eliminate as many of the problem possibilities or incompatibilities as i can </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> well i will take that into consideration then </s>
<s> thank you for your opinion </s>
<s> over 20 years of years experience building and upgrading pcs </s>
<s> i strongly recommend getting the max you need when you originally buy the system thus avoiding the upgrade and the potential mismatch conundrum </s>
<s> let us know how it turns out </s>
