<s> i have a cable internet connection in bldg 1 where we have a wirelss internet connection on a linksys wrt54g set up for our customers for free public access </s>
<s> i have another computer in bldg2 which is about 600 feet away with clear access no trees nothing </s>
<s> i cannot run cable underground or on telephone poles i want to use the wireless internet connection for bldg2 so my big question is how can i expand my wireless signal to reach bldg 2 and be strong </s>
<s> thanks for your help and input ahead of time </s>

<s> and the fcc limits the power in any direction </s>
<s> if this is a diy setup on your own land you can get away with better antennas but rain will kill the distance </s>

<s> thanks for your reply bob but i dont understand diy </s>
<s> its not my land its where i work at </s>
<s> i cant run a antenna off bldg1 connected to the router and put a bigger wireless card in the computer in bldg2 or some type of reciever to catch the wireless signal and get it to work </s>
<s> or should i look a wireless broadband </s>
<s> thanks again ehunt32 </s>
<s> it s a common acronym </s>
<s> try google when you find a new term as to the antenna you can try it but at that distance it s far over what wifi gear off the consumer lines offer </s>
<s> must it work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> external antenna then range extender at the wireless location furthest from the signal </s>
<s> gets a little pricey but if no major impediments good chance </s>
