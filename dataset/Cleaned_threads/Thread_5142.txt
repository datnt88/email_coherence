<s> i have an hp pavilion computer with windows me operating system </s>
<s> it is connected to an hp deskjet 932c printer </s>
<s> for a while now when i print in color i find that i get pink and black but no blue and yellow </s>
<s> i uninstalled and then reinstalled the printer </s>
<s> i used the toolbox to clean the cartridges and recalibrate the printer </s>
<s> since this has happened with two cartridges bought at separate times i don t think it s a cartridge problem </s>
<s> i have also cleaned the surfaces around the cartridge with a damp rag </s>
<s> nothing has worked thus far </s>
<s> any suggestions would be most appreciated </s>
<s> hello ruthinor after going through the issue i understood the issue could be with the printer copper contacts </s>
<s> if the copper contacts get damaged such issue occurs </s>
<s> i have some steps to clean the copper contacts of the printer </s>
<s> i am providing them below pelase perform them note you will need a clean dry soft lint free cloth cotton swabs and distilled water </s>
<s> use of cleaning agents or cleaning alcohol may damage the electrical contacts </s>
<s> 1 power on the printer and raise the printer s top cover </s>
<s> wait for the carriage to stop </s>
<s> 2 unplug the power cord from the back of the printer </s>
<s> 3 remove the ink cartridges from the cradles and place them on their sides with the widest side down onto a scrap piece of paper </s>
<s> caution keep the print cartridges out of the reach of children and make sure that the cartridges are not kept outside the printer for more than 30 minutes </s>
<s> 4 ensure that the copper flex circuitry on the back of the cartridge is intact and not damaged </s>
<s> black hp no </s>
<s> 45 hp 51645 series tri color hp no </s>
<s> 78 hp c6578 series 5 clean the cradle contacts a position yourself at eye level with the printer </s>
<s> b locate the cradle that holds the ink cartridge </s>
<s> c using clean moistened swabs wipe the underside of each wall of the carriage where fibers may collect and come in contact with the paper </s>
<s> repeat until no ink residue is seen on a clean swab </s>
<s> 6 clean the print cartridges a grasp the top of the black print cartridge </s>
<s> b wipe the copper colored strip on the back of the cartridge with the dry cloth </s>
<s> use an upward motion from the nozzle end to the top of the cartridge </s>
<s> wipe the contacts only once </s>
<s> c dip a clean cotton swab into distilled water and squeeze the excess water from the swab </s>
<s> d clean the face and edges of the inkjet print cartridge </s>
<s> do not wipe the nozzle plate </s>
<s> caution be careful not to touch the ink nozzles on the bottom of the cartridge or the copper contacts on the back of the print cartridge with the wet swab </s>
<s> touching these parts of the print cartridge can result in clogs ink failure or bad electrical connection </s>
<s> e hold the print cartridge up to the light to inspect for fibers on the face and edges </s>
<s> if fibers are still present repeat steps c and d </s>
<s> f repeat steps a through e with the tri color print cartridge using a clean moistened cotton swab to avoid any contamination </s>
<s> 7 reinstall the ink cartridges and ensure that the cartridge latch is in the quot lock quot position </s>
<s> 8 close the printer s top cover </s>
<s> 9 reconnect the power cord to the back of the printer </s>
<s> this should resolve the issue </s>
<s> reply me with the result </s>
<s> arun </s>
<s> have the same situation on an hp 952c printer magenta and black prints nothing else </s>
<s> new cartridge installed same thing </s>
<s> tried everything yadev suggested with no success </s>
<s> contacts on back of carriage and cartidge appear perfect </s>
<s> anything else </s>
<s> i have the same problem on a hp 7755 no yellow </s>
<s> i have just changed the printer cartridge and still have the problem </s>
<s> i reckon it must be the power supply as it s the only remaining common item </s>
<s> i m trying to source another one </s>
<s> try downloading the drivers for your printer off the hp site according to your os </s>
<s> if you use a windows 98 driver for your windows xp it may not function correctly </s>
<s> i do suggest using a soft toothbrush and some alcohol dip brush and gingerly brush the carriage contact area </s>
<s> wipe with a clean cloth or shop towel leave no towel residue repeat 2 3 times allow to dry </s>
<s> return ink cart but you should wipe ink cart contacts as well </s>
<s> test and check results </s>
<s> best done with new ink cart </s>
<s> if results are the same possible bad carraige cable harness or electronics on logic rare in eiither case the repair cost if no warranty will suggest buy new printer </s>
<s> i thought any s w issues if the test pattern hp uses fails </s>
<s> further a complete tear down to fully inspect and clean innards maybe a last resort but usually doesn t help but access to clean unseen areas </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
