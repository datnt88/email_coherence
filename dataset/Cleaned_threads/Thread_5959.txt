<s> i have 3 computers and am trying to hook them up to a network </s>
<s> i have the linksys wrt54g and the appropriate adapters for the other 2 computers </s>
<s> i installed the router and was able to connect to the internet fine </s>
<s> it told me to install the other 2 adapters before setting up the network </s>
<s> i installed the 1st adapter fine and came to check my router connection and i could connect to the internet </s>
<s> i tried everything to connect and finally had to restore to yesterdays settings just to be able to use my cable modem again </s>
<s> what am i doing wrong </s>

<s> since you didn t tell us anything about your system that s all i can say </s>
<s> it can make a difference how your network is booted up </s>
<s> the manufacturers manual will probably tell you in which order to boot the system after installing all your hardware </s>

<s> thanks steve </s>
<s> make sure you have your firewall set to allow connections in the trusted zone </s>
<s> this is your home network </s>
<s> the ip address range is usually depending on your router 192 168 0 100 to 192 168 0 199 you ll need to set up each machine within that range </s>
<s> good luck click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about internet connections and data and download free software </s>
