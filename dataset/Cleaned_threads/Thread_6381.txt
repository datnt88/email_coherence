<s> how many emails can a 16 gb flash drive hold </s>
<s> 5000 emails </s>
<s> 7500 emails </s>
<s> 10 000 emails </s>
<s> assuming about 2 pages per email no video no movies thank you </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the 2 page text email is about 60 characters per line of 50 lines so that s 3 000 bytes per page or 6k for 2 pages </s>
<s> now let s bump that up to 10k to allow for overhead and make the calculation easy </s>
<s> 16 gb is 16 000 000 000 and 10k is 10 000 so now we can just knock 4 zeros of that 16 gb and get 1 600 000 emails </s>
<s> is that enough for you </s>
<s> thank you wpgwpg </s>
<s> i guess the 16 is adequate thanks for doing the quick math couldn t find that answer anywhere is it easy to do </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> hopefully not 1 by 1 where could i find those directions </s>
