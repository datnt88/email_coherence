<s> you head to the bios to see if the bios lists it </s>
<s> if the bios does not you ask the machine s maker big questions </s>

<s> bob it does appear in the bios </s>
<s> i don t think it is a loose cable because when i restart the drives are back to normal </s>
<s> but this is too new for that issue but we d check anyway </s>
<s> it s possible the builder didn t install the chipset drivers latest bios and overtaxed the psu </s>
<s> looks like you have questions for this pc s maker </s>
