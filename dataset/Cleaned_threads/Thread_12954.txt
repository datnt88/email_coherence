<s> can anyone recommend a scanner to scan farbic collage </s>
<s> they re not very thick a few layers of fabric </s>
<s> i print a photo on my inkjet printer which is then sewn onto fabric usually silk </s>
<s> the fabric can be shiny and doesn t photograph well </s>
<s> i thought a scanner would do a better job </s>
<s> the end result will go on my website </s>
<s> most forums concentrate on photo scanning </s>
<s> my intent is rather unusal </s>
<s> i think a resolution of 3200x6400 dpi will do </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i need to think anything with much texture is going to be a challenge for any scanner </s>
<s> these don t do well with shiny surfaces either </s>
<s> i am not sure what problems you are having with photographic methods </s>
<s> if you use a flash head on this will not work </s>
<s> light can be manipulated quite a bit </s>
<s> if the light is well diffused it should come out fairly even </s>
<s> if you want the image to show a little sheen in the fabric you can leave it somewhat wrinkled and use some side lighting which which can be angled to cause some subtle reflections </s>
<s> i m for going back to the camera </s>
<s> the problem i m having with the camera is that the camera is a not much a gateway w 5 mega pixel </s>
<s> i can take good pictures of cotton fabric but it s the silk or exotic fabrics that don t do well </s>
<s> my options were to buy a realy good digital camera or a scanner so i thought a scanner would be less expensive </s>
<s> also i don t know much about photography or scanning but i have a feeling i m going to have learn one or the other to get what i need </s>
<s> thanks for your response </s>
