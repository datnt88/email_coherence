<s> i m looking for a 20 quot 21 quot wide screen lcd monitor for graphic design purpose </s>
<s> my most concerned are image quality color fidelity graphics control capabilities </s>
<s> macintosh osx platform price range from 400 550 </s>
<s> i would apreciate if anybody can make some suggestions </s>
<s> million thx </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the 2 will work great together and the color on yours will be almost exactly like another apple setup </s>
<s> for color correctness you ll get the pantone spyder if you are truly serious about that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thx bob </s>
<s> i realize apple s monitor is one of the best choices but it s a bit too expensive to me i m planning to buy 3 monitors </s>
<s> so i m searching for some other options with good performance at more reasonable cost </s>
<s> thx anyway </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there goes color correction too </s>
<s> now that we ve tossed out that you just need to find your price </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> for quality price and design the vx2025wm is the most recommended for you </s>
<s> take a look ate their site and enjoy </s>
<s> xd i was about to get one 32 quot lcd but the resolution for those is so small instead of gain you lose workspace 1280x768 bah </s>
<s> better to have a 23 quot max </s>
<s> honestly my first choice would be the apple monitors </s>
<s> sure they re pricey but they are great </s>
<s> two of the three choices of their monitors also work with windows based pc s too provided you have the right type of video card </s>
<s> if you want to choose something other than apple then i would recommend viewsonic s pro series </s>
<s> there are 3 series that viewsonic puts out and there is a difference in how well they perform so pay attention to the little vx va etc </s>
<s> in front of the model numbers </s>
<s> va is the value series vx is the pro series </s>
<s> they too are pricey but well worth it if you are a pro graphics person </s>
<s> lastly samsung makes a pro series as well again the same notes apply as above </s>
<s> for the most part the pro type series of monitors are not going to be available at most stores </s>
<s> so i recommend starting at each manufacturers web site to get the choices specs etc and then do some comparitive shopping online </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> maggie b </s>
<s> this monitor is awesome </s>
<s> check out toms hardware page for recommendations </s>
<s> i bought the viewsonic vp191b and have been very happy with it </s>
<s> i don t sell these yet so don t think this is just spam </s>
<s> most all phillips monitors have a three year warranty and some come with a quot perfect panel quot designation </s>
<s> it means just that no dead pixels </s>
<s> plus a quick turn around in case something does happen </s>
<s> they re not cheap but viewsonic would be my second choice but their huge list of part numbers make it difficult to find the exact product that you are looking for </s>
<s> i as a dealer can even get a little overwelmed with viewsonic </s>
<s> weeding through all of the offerings and then checking with different vendors to find my choice gets old </s>
<s> then having to do it all over in three weeks because that part is no longer stocked </s>
<s> don t get me wrong they make a good product </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i have been using microtek 815c 18 quot for the last 3 years </s>
<s> the picture is crisp and clear </s>
<s> my son has used autocad with it </s>
<s> his friend bought one earlier this year and plays oblivion and doom with great graphics </s>
<s> based off of our 18 quot lcd s i bet their 20 21 s will be just as good </s>
<s> they re only good for movies </s>
<s> they stretch the picture on everything else and looks terrible unless you like 2 black stripes on either side </s>
<s> costing you 4 quot of horizontal screen size </s>
<s> 17 quot </s>
<s> if you use this monitor vertically it s very slick </s>
<s> imagine a dual monitor display 2 operating vertically </s>
<s> that s some real graphics power </s>
<s> nvidia s driver will allow rotation </s>
<s> no one mentioned dell </s>
<s> i ve used them at work and was considering buying a 19 quot monitor for home </s>
<s> any opinions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
