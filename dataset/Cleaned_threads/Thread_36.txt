<s> i have a 500 gig seagate external hard drive which i use to back up pictures of my son and friends and whatnot from my recently purchased dell laptop with windows vista </s>
<s> i also back up on disc </s>
<s> i took the external drive to a friends and hooked it up to his mac </s>
<s> it worked fine for a while as i put a few of his music files on it then i walked away from it for about an hour and came back to find it showing the disc space as being full but not having any files </s>
<s> then the panic sets in </s>
<s> so i got a new external and have spent days taking pics off discs and transfering to the new one but i have many discs that are old and don t read and now realize that i have lost a good chunk of my sons childhood pictures and many of my friends despite my best efforts to back everything up twice </s>
<s> so does anyone know if the seagate being hooked up to a mac could have done some random reformatting or if it sounds like a virus from the music files </s>
<s> should i try scanning it or send it to data doctors to pay a bunch and probably not get anything back </s>
<s> i don t know </s>
<s> any help would be appreciate greatly </s>
<s> the originals should be fine so why not wipe and start over </s>
<s> unless this is not a backup and is instead quot storage quot in this forum we have some resolutions and fixes </s>
<s> here they are in quick fire form </s>
<s> 1 remove the drive and place it as slave in a desktop </s>
<s> 2 copy the files out </s>
<s> 3 not showing up </s>
<s> try each of these titles found with google </s>
<s> a getdataback b zero assumption recovery 4 usually does a great job </s>
<s> but is this a backup or storage is the real question </s>
<s> if backup that s one thing </s>
<s> but storage you will find you need a backup plan </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for the help i am going to try those suggestions </s>
<s> i suppose it would be storage and backup </s>
<s> i had my pictures stored on another drive in the house that just crashed last week and then all i had was the backup on my external which then became my storage and then did this weird thing days after the other hard drive crash </s>
<s> but i still had other backup on the discs of which most aren t reading now either </s>
<s> grr if it was all back up then i would be fine but like dominoes i lost 3 different places of storage and backup </s>
<s> backup is backup </s>
<s> you saved some or xfer some music files to your ext </s>
<s> hd that suggests more for storage </s>
<s> while you think it can do that the fact reminds in your experience you found that storage use is making backup use in doubt </s>
<s> plainly put use it for one or the other and only on your system </s>
<s> if you want to xfer files from mac to ibm etc </s>
<s> use a flash drive that way the lost of only that data is at risk </s>
<s> the resolutions robert provided is about it if your problem persists you re stuck </s>
<s> also backup should include any data burned to cd dvd as well for yet another source of backup </s>
<s> up to you on a recovery process the value you place on it </s>
<s> as for the probable cause if you read these forums anything is possible </s>
<s> someone could have handled the ext </s>
<s> hd not thinking it was on </s>
<s> as for virus scan it or system to exclude that </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> reread my last post </s>
<s> this seems so consequential as you now explain you have a previous crashed hd and now your ext </s>
<s> hd is kaput too </s>
<s> either you have malware at work or you ve experienced some ac elect </s>
<s> issue to include a possible bad psu </s>
<s> as for malware if your friend system experiences some issue too then its that </s>
<s> but because it s a mac it may not as an ibm type malware may not attack a mac as well </s>
<s> once things settle down do an av scan or use an online scan as well for further checking </s>
<s> the security virus malware forum provides links to various pgms </s>
<s> that can help </s>
<s> fyi i replied to your original post not the follow up which may or may not been present or read </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
