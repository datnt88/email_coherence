<s> i am looking to buy a laptop with three antennas capable of 450 mbps speed </s>
<s> 3x3 mimo </s>
<s> the only one i know of is the alienware 17 and 18 inch which have the killer 1103 wireless card pre installed and 3 antennas </s>
<s> i think the new macbook pro has an intel centrino ultimate wireless n 6300 are there any others that anyone knows about </s>
<s> there was a dell e5210 but it is discontinued </s>
<s> why would you limit your laptop choice when there may be other feature just as important like memory or processor speeds </s>
<s> i would just use a external usb or bridge </s>
<s> in most cases these actually work better because many have external antenna </s>
<s> another advantage is you do not have to worry about how your laptop screen is positioned the antennas are normally behind the screen </s>
<s> all that said 450m is another magic marketing number </s>
<s> you will only get that in a lab condition and in many cases it will actually make your connection slower </s>
<s> since to get 450m they use the complete 2 4g range </s>
<s> this means if anyone else near you has a wireless router they are 100 guaranteed to interfere with you </s>
<s> your router will try to fix this by changing the speeds and encoding on the fly but this changing is a common cause of dropping and authentication delays </s>
<s> it s not going to say give it double the range so why would i not look at the entire machine instead </s>
<s> current models that is the ones that are not in the cheap category seem just fine on wifi </s>

<s> i use an asus n66u black knight 3x3 stream 450 mbps router and ea66u 3x3 access point now </s>
<s> in order to get full advantage of this speed i need a laptop with three antennas using either an intel centrino wireless n 6300 or killer 1103 the only 3x3 mimo laptops i can find are macbook pro and alienware m17 and m18 </s>
<s> even with 3 antennas it only uses one at a time </s>
<s> it will use the best one and that s why it could work better than some </s>
<s> the real issue would be the cards </s>
<s> if you can t find laptops with compatible cards then you can use external cards </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> actually what he is talking about is a option that actually has 3 separate transmitters </s>
<s> a lot of the early routers were running other variants of mimo have to read the fine print </s>
<s> lots of technical arguments about if it really makes any difference or not </s>
<s> i can see why many laptops do not have this since it has to eat 3 times the power to run 3 radio units </s>
<s> as ideas come and go it s like that super duper device you had back on cp m and you fast forward to now and no one knows what to do with it or how it worked </s>
<s> since 3 radios would be more cost as well as the heat it probably fell out of favor as higher rate 802 11n came along that was more a standard than a 3 radio solution </s>
<s> maybe it s time to move to today s solutions or when high speed is needed get wired </s>
<s> i know i get wired when i want to move big files the laptops here have 1000bt ports </s>
