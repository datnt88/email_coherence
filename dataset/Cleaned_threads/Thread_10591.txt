<s> i have been looking for a 19 inch lcd monitor but i am finding that the ones i am trying have a tendency to give off a fuzzy slight crosshatch pattern when there is movement on the screen such as in games or when i drag a window around the screen </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea what this is that i am seeing </s>
<s> to my eyes it appears as a small criss cross pattern that really is noticeable to me </s>
<s> any ideas would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> have to shell out some bucks </s>
<s> samsung and viewsonic are the best bet in my book </s>
<s> make sure you have at least a 600 1 contrast ratio </s>
<s> you ll spend between 300 550 </s>
<s> there are cheaper ones out there but not for games </s>
<s> and life goes on jack ps look at cnet reviews for the best ones </s>
<s> look at the pixel response rate time in the lcd monitor s specifications details </s>
<s> the faster the response rate the less pixelation and smearing you will see </s>
<s> aim for 16ms or less </s>
<s> you will pay more for the faster rate </s>
<s> look at display reviews on gaming websites </s>
