<s> i have a intel 865perll board and would like to know what is the fastest processor i can use </s>
<s> i have lost track of the terms used anymore so it would help me if you could link to the fastest processor and maybe one a little slower if there is a large price difference </s>
<s> thank you gene </s>
<s> it s the first question noted at try that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this is the only fast processor that fits the board </s>
<s> i told you i have been away from this sort of thing for a while </s>
<s> and about all i got from that link was i need a cpu with 512 l2 cache </s>
<s> northwood and this is the only fast processor i could find that fits that bill </s>
<s> i think thanks </s>
<s> that you have </s>
<s> it sure seems that the link that robert gave you shows the answers to your question </s>
<s> why did you limit it to the link that you sent </s>
<s> but my board is aac27646 206 which seems to rule out the top 8 processors on the list or am i missing something </s>
<s> it seems i can only use a cpu with 512 l2 cache or again do i not understand </s>
<s> and after googling the only cpu i could find like that over 3 gb was that board </s>
<s> and its too expensive i can almost get a new board and cpu for that price </s>
<s> does that board require the northwood cpu </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
