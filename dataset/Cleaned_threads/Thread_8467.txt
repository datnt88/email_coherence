<s> ok i have perused the posts and web </s>
<s> it seems the issue i am experiencing with this external from maxtor is a prominent one </s>
<s> i have had the hd for about 1 year </s>
<s> always on always connected to the pc </s>
<s> the other day it quot fell asleep quot and i cannot wake it up </s>
<s> upper light constantly blinking i have read the success others have had with connecting these seagate drives directly to their sata ports internally and the computer recognizing the drive thus restoring all potentially lost files </s>
<s> is a bit different </s>
<s> my hd is the 1 tb model upon opening the case it is actually 2 500 gb drives running in dual mode giving me the overall capacity of 1 tb recognized by my computer as 1 drive </s>
<s> has anyone had any luck restoring or getting the computer to recognize a quot dual drive quot situation outside of the maxtor one touch case </s>
<s> when connected internally my pc sees the drives as one but when double clicking on the drive letter i get a quot corrupted file quot message </s>
<s> does that truly mean the info is corrupted or am i missing a step in getting my computer to recognize the dual drives as one internally </s>
<s> bypassing the maxtor 1 touch iii 1tb case electronics thanks </s>
<s> time to call maxtor </s>
<s> let s hope your backups were current </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am guessing that because you replied quot ouch quot and there is no way to pair the dual drives outside of maxtor s magic one touch box my situation is bleak </s>
<s> i do have a redundant backup but capacity is not as large as the tb </s>
<s> so i do not do full backups on the redundant </s>
<s> just when i thought i was safe with a single backup drive now i have to have a backup for the backup </s>
<s> where does it all end </s>
<s> maxtor will have to share how outside of their hardware </s>
<s> there is also someone besides maxtor gt but let s be honest here </s>
<s> recovery is more money than backups </s>
<s> its sad to read that this is not a single drive since the usuals do work most of the time </s>
<s> just not on this one </s>
<s> is it worth the money to buy another maxtor dual </s>
<s> as to backups </s>
<s> here s the gruesome truth </s>
<s> we need at least 3 copies to call it backed up </s>
<s> why 3 </s>
<s> because when one fails we still have 2 copies to retrieve from and if some pest trojan botches the recovery we have that last backup </s>
<s> what i find missing from all these drives is the quot write protect switch quot bob </s>
