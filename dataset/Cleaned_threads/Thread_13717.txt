<s> it started mid november when my computer suddenly wouldn t boot up </s>
<s> it would look like it was going to and then go to blue screen then to another screen and then to the initial microsoft windows picture over over again </s>
<s> all i can think that happened shortly before that that i had done was try to download a couple photo viewers that were suggested in a couple emails my father had sent me </s>
<s> i can t seem to figure out if they actually installed onto my computer </s>
<s> at the same time i thought as long as i m into this process i should install the cd that came with a 5 0 polaroid camera disk has photo express 5 0 photo explorer 8 0 and pc cam driver </s>
<s> again not sure if it installed or not </s>
<s> i then thought i could plug the cord that came with the cameral into the front usb port on my computer hp pavilion a600n </s>
<s> that did nothing </s>
<s> then i remembered i could put a sd card into the battery compartment download pictures that way and forgot about it </s>
<s> the problem did not arise immediately after any of these things but not too long after </s>
<s> my computer is also set for automatic updates so that is a remote possibility </s>
<s> now i can t recall when it first happened </s>
<s> whether i was using the computer or when i turned it on </s>
<s> i tried over and over to turn my computer on and always the same thing </s>
<s> i ended up with a dos screen and none of the options there to start the screen worked except the option to take the computer back to out of the box condition which i didn t want to do as i d never get it back to where it was hadn t backed up my computer for a long time </s>
<s> i simply didn t even try to use it for at least a week </s>
<s> then i tried once more and it booted up fine </s>
<s> when i went to print something i realized i had powered off my printer while i wasn t using the computer so i turned it on and immediately blue screen </s>
<s> recently i ve figured out that basically it s anything that connects to my computer via a usb cable that also has its own power cord that causes the problem </s>
<s> the few usb devices i have that use the computer s power seem to work without causing the boot problem </s>
<s> my big problem is i can t figure out how to back up the computer at this point since my external hard drive connects via usb has a power cord so causes thecomputer to not boot </s>
<s> any ideas would be appreciated </s>
<s> it is one long paragraph so while it would be nice to know the make and model i may have missed it because of that long paragraph </s>
<s> let me share a laptop i own had a similar issue </s>
<s> i cured it by using a powered usb 2 0 hub inbetween the pc and the drive </s>
<s> now it boots up fine </s>
<s> if you get a random reboot check your laptop s maker for quot motherboard quot drivers </s>

<s> hi there i am being driven demented by what appears to be the same problem as you have had and i was wondering if you solved it yourself and if so how exactly </s>
<s> here s hoping and thanks a million </s>
<s> graeme </s>
<s> quot check your laptop s maker for quot motherboard quot drivers quot i deal with a lot of machines </s>
<s> the issue pops up a lot but sadly many owners can t deal with finding drivers so what are we to do </s>
