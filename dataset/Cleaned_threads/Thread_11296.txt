<s> canon i455 a few years old </s>
<s> was connected to my pc and shared across my network </s>
<s> a few months ago i got a nas and connected the printer there still shared worked perfectly didn t have to turn my pc on for others to print </s>
<s> tried to print a text file this morning no text </s>
<s> print head moved but no black ink yes new cartridge </s>
<s> did a nozzle check and all colors and black printed </s>
<s> tried text file again everything moved but no text </s>
<s> moved the printer back to my pc and did a nozzle check </s>
<s> all ok tried to print the document no text </s>
<s> created a document in word same same </s>
<s> changed the color of the text to blue and voila </s>
<s> so it s not printing black </s>
<s> all printer tests work but no black on any document </s>
<s> time for a new printer </s>
<s> if this happened after you replaced the ink cart then its an ink cart issue </s>
<s> especially if this is a refilled ink cart or generic type </s>
<s> newer inkjets use all ink to print its output its really not black unless you have quot mono output quot selection </s>
<s> they do this so all inkjets get used and not become clogged due to non use </s>
<s> i exclude any possible electronics issue here or introduced s w glitch </s>
<s> i would suggest you do an alignment etc test and check results etc if fails or never corrects then replace printer </s>
<s> its probably the cheapest fix when new ink carts become involved </s>
<s> you could try this printer on an entirely different system that never had it and install it to test </s>
<s> if you buy new printer look into similar model or canon that uses same ink carts to help in that area </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> it prints black and colors on a nozzle check </s>
<s> new cartridge and i used it about a week ago </s>
<s> i do not use recycled generic refilled cartridges only canon fresh out of the box </s>
<s> i ll install it on my laptop and see what happens </s>
<s> it was out of ink </s>
<s> and i found out something useful </s>
<s> when connected to the nas the ink monitor does not work </s>
<s> installed it on the laptop and after a few times of going through the tests and checks i looked at the levels </s>
<s> duh </s>
<s> these levels do not show up correctly when connected to the nas </s>
<s> put a new cartridge in and voila </s>
<s> the nas is nice but it will not display the printer monitor </s>
<s> i m glad you sorted it all out </s>
<s> remember the quot ink monitoring pgm quot is nothing more than estimate or approx </s>
<s> of ink level </s>
<s> defeating or ignoring the new ink cart install align </s>
<s> starts sometimes this issue and or get out of whack and keeps wanting attention </s>
<s> even if not displayed it has become a sore spot </s>
<s> i wish the times i could carry another system with me on calls as laptop sits at home </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
