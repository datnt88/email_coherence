<s> so this is kind of hard to explain i live in an apartment complex that provides internet as part of the lease </s>
<s> we have a internet switch in a closet that sends internet to different rooms </s>
<s> when we connect via cord the internet works perfectly fine </s>
<s> but when we connect a router to the internet it works for a bit and then stops wired and wireless </s>
<s> but when we unplug the router and plug in the computer it works no problem </s>
<s> we tried two routers and both do the same thing </s>
<s> both routers work just fine when used with other peoples that do not live in my complex internet </s>
<s> there is no problem with the computers connecting to the router </s>
<s> i can get to the set up and settings console via wireless no problem </s>
<s> so what i m asking what could be causing this to happen </s>
<s> is there something that can cause a router to stop working yet the computer can overcome </s>
<s> i could not figure out how to edit my post so here is some more info </s>
<s> my current router is a tp link tl wr841n </s>
<s> my roommate and i both have windows 7 computers </s>
<s> it s noted in the forum sticky </s>
<s> but you can google it too </s>
<s> the words for google are how to user a router as a wap </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for pointing me in the right direction </s>
<s> well i hope </s>
<s> i don t know much about these things </s>
<s> hence why i came here </s>
<s> i don t know what a wap is so how can i find it in the stickies </s>
<s> i looked in the four for this forum and it was all gibberish to me </s>
<s> that s why i asked here </s>
<s> no one expects folk to be a network guru overnight </s>
<s> unlike some places with a faq here we only have the posts in these forums and some stuck to the top aka quot stickies quot bob </s>
