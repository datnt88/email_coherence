<s> i started building a new computer that would not boot into windows </s>
<s> i thought that it was maybe the processor amd sempron because the mobo didnt directily say that it would take it </s>
<s> however i ended up haveing the hd jumper in the wrong place </s>
<s> it works now </s>
<s> but the problem is when i took my old amd athlon 1800 out of my other computer to test the new computer </s>
<s> i thought that if the 1800 worked then it was the sempron that was the problem the 1800 didnt work so went back to the other </s>
<s> when i reinstalled the 1800 into my old system the computer would begin to start up </s>
<s> fans lights hd cds floppy all begin to start up but within 3 seconds it shuts down without a beep without any signal to the monitor </s>
<s> it is strange </s>
<s> does anybody know what i did </s>
<s> did i fry the cpu </s>
<s> mobo </s>
<s> something </s>
<s> thanks tyler </s>
<s> the cpu and the hsf put a new thin coating of thermal compound on it </s>
<s> seems that it is overheating rapidly </s>
<s> get the d d cpu hsf mounted properly before you try again </s>
<s> if it is shutting itself down there is hope that the cpu has protected itself to our human intervention </s>
<s> susceptible to overheating crash and burning </s>
<s> proper installation with heat sink compound and hsf is imperative </s>
<s> thanks i will try this </s>
<s> the thermal tape was basically gone so i will try that </s>
<s> tyler </s>
<s> reapplying the compound was the trick </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>

<s> alright when i try updating my ipod the system will shut down half way through the update </s>
<s> weird because the system is relativly stable all the time except when i update </s>
<s> do you think the ipod is drawing too much power is something wrong with the cpu or short on memory </s>
<s> i dont know i have racked my brain and i can t come up with an explination </s>
<s> one thing else happens </s>
<s> after the abrupt shut down if i try to restart the fans and system will start but the monitor will not have anything displayed the light just blinks </s>
<s> if i wait for 5 mins or so and try again it boots up fine </s>
<s> do you think the heatsink isnt doing its job and the cpu is overheating </s>
<s> any help will be appreciated by te computer because i am about to kick it out into the middle of the street </s>
<s> tyler </s>
<s> read quot new problems quot first so it doesnt have everything to do with the ipod b c it just shut down again a few mins ago when i was just doin email </s>
<s> and unlike i said before i dont have to wait any time to reboot </s>
<s> it always follows this pattern 1 randomly shuts down after a while 2 i reboot </s>
<s> 3 i do a hard shut down by holding power for 8 secs </s>
<s> 4 i reboot and it starts up with ease </s>
<s> tyler </s>
<s> look at previous posts i cant figure out wether it is the cpu or another thing that is wrong </s>
<s> logic suggests cpu since that is what i messed with is it possible to shock a cpu and it still work for a while and act like it is now </s>
<s> do you think that the new thermal paste is not doin its job causing it to overheat during intensive cpu use </s>
<s> please help tyler </s>
<s> it does sound as if the cpu is still overheating </s>
<s> i would reinstall the cpu being very careful that the thermal paste is applied properly </s>
<s> a thin even coat of paste is required </s>
<s> some use a single edged razor blade to apply the paste </s>
<s> the paste should be just thick enough that you can t see through it </s>
<s> if it is applied too thick or too thin you can get undesirable results </s>
<s> best of luck </s>
<s> of the present situation in one post </s>
<s> i can t read all four while trying to respond </s>
<s> i just set up two monitors wonder if i can drag each post to a different spot on the monitors </s>
<s> the long delay before it starts makes sense for overtemped cpu but that only happened once possibly indicating that the video card overheated </s>
<s> does your video card have a fan </s>
<s> is its heat sink clogged with dust </s>
<s> maybe i misunderstood how often which symptom occurs </s>
<s> do you have any type of temperature monitoring </s>
<s> how about in the bios </s>
<s> when first booting the temp in the bios will not be high </s>
<s> after running a while reboot and go into the bios and check the temps </s>
