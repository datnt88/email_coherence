<s> hi all first time poster </s>
<s> i m building a computer for the first time </s>
<s> i m 99 sure i did it all right but alas when i go to power up for the first time nothing happens </s>
<s> nothing </s>
<s> does anyone know what might be wrong </s>

<s> please help me figure out what s wrong </s>
<s> thanks all john mindwerkz </s>
<s> by nothing you mean no power from the power supply no fans spinning no beeps from the internal speaker </s>
<s> check the power supply voltage switch is set to the correct line voltage </s>
<s> test the outlet the power cord is plugged into </s>
<s> check the power switch header on the motherboard for the correct orientation of the connector to the switch </s>
<s> to test the power switch on the box remove the connector from the header and short the header pins with a small screwdriver </s>
<s> if the case switch is bad this should start the machine </s>
<s> first time builders often try to install everything at once </s>
<s> instead a test as you go approach is a good idea </s>
<s> 1 motherboard powersuppply speaker and cpu heatsinkfan hsf will get you beeps </s>
<s> the power switch is pushed and it usually beeps </s>
<s> no beeps and you are looking at the possible misconfigured or bad parts </s>
<s> 2 some system board come with the cmos reset in the reset position </s>
<s> will not power up either </s>
