<s> i ve just installed a new mother board and processor into my pc and now i cannot transfer my video to my pc </s>
<s> my firewire pci card is installed correctly and the camera is recognised by win xp home and i can control the camera rewind the tape but i get an error when trying to capture the video </s>
<s> the sony suplied software does not recognise the camera </s>
<s> adobe premier pro and win movie maker recognises it </s>
<s> please can anyone help </s>
<s> xp doesn t take well to motherboard changes </s>
<s> did you try installing motherboard drivers </s>
<s> is the bios the latest </s>
<s> hint new board doesn t mean its the latest </s>
<s> worse case scenario </s>
<s> total os install </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> all drivers are now fully up to date including the bios and it still does not work </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> installing a motherboard and quot fixing quot xp rarely works </s>
<s> no one will help you fix this issue </s>
<s> it s either a total wipeout and proper install of the os or you get lucky and move the card or you dive in and remove devices in the device manager and let windows redetect and you add drivers again </s>
<s> you would also remove the software and reinstall it </s>
<s> it s unlikely sony will help you in os issues </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have tried everything that has been suggested to me in this forum it hasn t worked </s>
<s> thank you for your help in this matter </s>
<s> use the autofix and autoplay repair tools at this may help if you ve done the motherboard drivers and all that </s>
