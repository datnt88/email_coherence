<s> recently the drive when turned on starts to click rather loudly like it is trying to turn over or be recognised </s>
<s> now sometimes it does get recognised but only fater a very long time </s>
<s> when it doesn t get recognised it clicks ever say 8 10 seconds and the blue light at the opposite end to the power cord stats to go light pink purple colour </s>
<s> when i go into my computer the drive does not show up at all </s>
<s> when the system does recognise the drive it will eventually stop working or stop the computer from functioning </s>
