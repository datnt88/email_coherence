<s> i bought some new ddr2 memory but it won t fit </s>
<s> both my old and new memory have 240 pins </s>
<s> the memory i had has 64 pins then a gap then 56 pins each side which looking at google images and wikipedia seems standard </s>
<s> the new memory hyf2536481g has 68 pins then a gap then 52 pins each side </s>
<s> the gap is 73mm from the edge i thought all ddr2 memory had the same layout has anyone come across this </s>
<s> i thought they might have sent ddr because of the gap position but ddr has fewer pins </s>
<s> what help do you need </s>
<s> you can t change that stick </s>
<s> so return it and buy the right one </s>
<s> the memory finder at surely will lead to that </s>
<s> or if you prefer a physical shop above a webshop take an old stick with you when doing the exchange </s>

<s> i would buy the right one if i was confident of what that is </s>
<s> i would also like to find out if it was my mistake for ordering the wrong memory or the retailer has the wrong information on the memory wikipedia describes dimm ddr2 as being specifically identifiable by a gap 70mm across which would fit and not 73mm </s>
<s> crucial doesn t have the system listed or i would have ordered from them </s>
<s> the motherboard is ms 7301 which supports up to 2gb ddr2 memory </s>
<s> i did a bit of research and can t find any information on different pin positions in dimm ddr2 memory so i am a bit apprehensive about reordering until i find out so the same mistake isn t made pc5300 ddr2 dimm should be the right memory </s>
<s> i can t find it on crucial com indeed but is the page for the 7302 that says ddr2 pc2 5300 ddr2 pc2 6400 ddr2 pc2 8500 non ecc </s>
