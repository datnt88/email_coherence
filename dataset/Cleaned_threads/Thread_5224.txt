<s> i want to view and record my current tv lineup to my pc </s>
<s> i have a cable box from my cable company astound </s>
<s> will it go through the cable box for one channel viewing recording or is there a way to bypass the cable box for simultaneously viewing and recording on the pc like a dvr does </s>
<s> i have expanded basic cable programing </s>
<s> also what would be better a usb tuner or internal tv tuner card and whats a good one for under 100 00 </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> most of the cable tv but not all available on channels 2 125 will still be viewable on the tv tuner cards </s>
<s> hd may or may not be available </s>
<s> you would need to check with your provider if they offer clear qam channels </s>
<s> if you do not know what that means see here for a discussion or google for various clarification </s>
<s> once you find out what is available then start shopping </s>
<s> many like the hauppauge devices see here but you are free to explore other brands </s>
<s> would the quot hauppauge quot hd pvr do what i what </s>
<s> but it costs more than 100 you mentioned see here if you are not as concerned with hd recording then the wintv pvr line is quite popular </s>
<s> there are four choices of that line or there are wintv hvr which add clear qam channels along with the sd channels </s>
<s> the hd pvr hauppauge 1212 is the most all round capable choice as long as the inputs fit your needs </s>
<s> it looks like you have to use component inputs for hd recording </s>
<s> it has pass thru so you can intercept the signal from the stb then on to your tv without any other changes in the connections </s>
<s> go for the ati wonder tv card </s>
<s> it has the highest ratings of any tuner cards out there </s>
