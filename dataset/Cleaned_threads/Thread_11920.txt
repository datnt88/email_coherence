<s> i think you have inadvertently revealed why so many folk build a pc and it results in a machine that just crashes </s>
<s> as to the graphics card i ll supply the list i like but without knowing about the use of the machine i have no reason to pick one </s>
<s> nice choice on the ssd </s>
<s> i see less woes with that line </s>
<s> here s the list bob </s>
<s> okay sounds like i should order that </s>
<s> purpose is casual gaming and hd movies to tv via hdmi </s>
<s> as to which card it s usually a matter of quot the budget quot </s>
<s> test the machine with the 4000 igp and your apps </s>
<s> if it works to your satisfaction your good to go </s>
<s> if not move on to the list from r p </s>
<s> if so these tend to come with a thermal pad that heats and spreads during the first uses </s>
<s> it just looks like a square piece of tape on the heatsink </s>
<s> if it s there you don t want to put thermal paste on top of it </s>
<s> i ve not had problems with intel thermal pads though some will advise to remove them and use pastes with silver powder in the blend </s>
<s> i d think those same people tend to recommend scrapping the intel hsf and replacing the entire thing with something heavy duty if the user plans to oc or do heavy gaming </s>
