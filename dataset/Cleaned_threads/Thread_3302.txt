<s> hey i have been havin a problem ever since i bought my comp </s>
<s> it either restarts automatically or hangs and then restarts </s>
<s> happens mostly when i am playin a game </s>
<s> my config amd 64 3800 gigabite k8n51pvmt motherboard 1gb hynix ram with a nvidia 7600gt xfx 250 seagate sata2 hdd </s>
<s> it s been bad since day one </s>
<s> let them fix it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if under warranty let them fix it as stated by robert </s>
<s> more than likely you have either a power supply psu or cooling problem </s>
<s> the cuase can be effected by either or even both as when gaming you are pushing the system to extremes </s>
<s> you can try to trottle back abit and see if things settle down </s>
<s> you can also open the case no warranty stickers </s>
<s> and see if cooling down helps plus usage or a household fan blowing into the case </s>
<s> cooling problem add extra fan s or better ones </s>
<s> if psu add a larger wattage unit </s>
<s> some video cards demand a at least 350w installed plus if with cooling understand a hot system degrades the psu thus cause an unstable unit </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
