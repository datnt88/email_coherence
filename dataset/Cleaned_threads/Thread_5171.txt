<s> see my earlier thread quot how to restore system if mb fails </s>
<s> quot started on 12 20 03 </s>
<s> i am convinced i have a hardware problem </s>
<s> lockup occurs at random points after boot up </s>
<s> i took my system apart before christmas and really cleaned it out good </s>
<s> removed all dust but system still locks up </s>
<s> seems to be locking up more than ever had to re boot 6 times today before it became stable </s>
<s> yesterday had to re boot 4 or 5 times before it became stable </s>
<s> i have the mb and power pack part numbers from compaq </s>
<s> how can i try to be sure what i have to replace before ordering new parts </s>
<s> note there was no visible sign of bad capacitors </s>
<s> power pack fan and cpu fan seem to be working fine </s>
<s> to repeat i run win98se with all updates on a compaq presario 5838 500 mhz amd athlon cpu 384 megs ram compaq 2 button wheel mouse logitech mouseware control center version 9 00 99 mouse driver version 9 00 internet explorer 6 0 all updates norton anti virus 2000 with all latest virus updates it has passed all virus scans including the latest update network neighborhood enabled </s>
<s> 1 take out a stick of memory </s>
<s> with windows 98 you may not notice it from 384 to 256 megabytes of memory </s>
<s> 2 leave to case cover off </s>
<s> 3 age </s>
<s> sadly even with no visible signs of capacitor issues they still age </s>
<s> the power supply motherboard and cpu are prime hardware suspects if a total reload of the os doesn t cure it </s>
<s> 4 no parasites allowed </s>
<s> this is my non negotiable item with five noted scans tools at there are more than virus out there </s>
<s> you don t want these either and norton does nothing to stop these </s>
<s> 5 unless i could get those parts for under 20 bucks i would not repair this machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for all of your responses </s>
<s> you are very helpful </s>
<s> the symptom is that my system locks up within the first 1 5 minutes of booting up then runs fine from then on </s>
<s> i have not turned off this pc since yesterday morning </s>
<s> so as i look for bad components what kind would exhibit the quot bad when cool good when warm quot characteristic </s>
<s> ps i ran all the quot checker quot stuff you referred me to </s>
<s> no problems detected </s>
<s> all the parts can lead to this issue </s>
<s> well maybe not the speaker some indicator leds and a case but maybe </s>
<s> i mentioned the age of the parts are working very much against us here </s>
<s> electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies motherboards and almost all parts of the pc age and decrease in capacity at an astonding rate </s>
<s> chips can exhibit such anomilies and there is no firm test to find which one in any economical manner except to swap out a board cpu chip and see if the issue vanishes </s>
<s> but since it does this with repeatability and you can use the machine maybe all you need to do is to not spend a dime </s>
<s> just turn it on 10 minutes ahead of time then reboot </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> if you want some engineering documentation on electrolytic capacitor aging then i can supply some but it s mostly charts and jargon that shows the aging of time and temperature </s>
<s> what no one really tells the consumers is that most machines will fail in some number of years or develop issues </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> now i ll go off and quot ponder quot some more </s>
<s> i know its time to get a new pc but 1 i don t relish the thought of the time required to quot learn quot win xp pro </s>
<s> 2 i will have to buy an upgrade to my office suite and probably spend some time learning it s anomalies they all have them </s>
<s> i am hooked on wordperfect office suite hate the thought of going to microsoft </s>
<s> 3 i ll have to re enable my home network </s>
<s> this pc is now the hub </s>
<s> it was a pain to set it up once </s>
<s> 4 i ll have to buy an upgrade for drive image and maybe for partition magic </s>
<s> all of the above takes much time </s>
<s> but considering all the time i have spent on the current pc issues maybe i should have made the jump sooner </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> i use the following suite on all the machines now that microsoft office is frankly getting too pushy about one copy per machine in my house </s>
<s> i can deal with it at work but at home no </s>
<s> open office from to complement web work the mozilla from xp was not a big move for me but i ran nt 4 0 at work for far too many years and windows 2000 the issues of 64 kilobyte resource pools and 4 gigabyte file size maximums make the 95 98 me line unusable now that i want to do video work at home </s>
<s> be sure to check that the fans are clear and running top notch and your machine may just need a 10 minute warning one last thought </s>
<s> if you are inside the box reseat the cards memory and such just to be sure </s>
