<s> installing xp is getting rough on owners </s>
<s> was your instructions like this gt bottom line </s>
<s> you want that restore cd </s>
<s> i wish i could find the restore cd </s>
<s> the instructions i received were much different than the ones you noted </s>
<s> the ones i got lead me thru a series of bios changes plus downloading quot microsoft bus driver quot and other procedures </s>
<s> this was not a downgrade from vista </s>
<s> this was a reinstall of windows xp this machine uses audio codecs legacy drivers and realtek high definition audio </s>
<s> i even went to realtek and tried their drivers </s>
<s> i guess i will try to install a audio card and see if that works </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>

<s> i m running into a gluttony of drivers which make me happy i ve been installing windows since windows 1 0 only microsoft seems to not get it that drivers are too hard for anyone that didn t use dos </s>
<s> if the audio driver installs but doesn t work hurt down the uaa from microsoft it s in a kb somewhere install that uninstall the audio driver reboot and if it s like other machines it just works </s>
<s> no one wants to claim rights to why it s getting so hard for drivers today </s>

<s> i some difficulty convincing microsoft that i didn t have the hotfix they said i had it in sp2 but belarc advisor didn t show it </s>
<s> they finally sent it and after unzipping it i tried many combinations of installing and unistalling hotfix drivers etc </s>
<s> it just started working and i don t know why and still is </s>
<s> thanks for all your help rlb </s>
<s> i meant quot hunt quot rather than hurt </s>
<s> as you discovered it s likely to be uaa </s>
<s> that s a quot real new quot layer in the drivers so you can imagine it s causing more troubles than it solves </s>
