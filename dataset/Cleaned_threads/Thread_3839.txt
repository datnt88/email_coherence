<s> i recently bought an 80gb zune </s>
<s> using my old ipod s plug that connects the zune to a tv i attempted to connect the zune to a friend s tv </s>
<s> however it did not work and i lost all of the directional buttons and touch features on the directional pad </s>
<s> the play pause and back buttons work fine </s>
<s> however i cannot restart it because this involved pressing up on the pad and back and this is obviously impossible with the pad out of commission </s>
<s> is there any software i can download to refresh the zune </s>
<s> additionally is there any other way to manually reset it </s>
<s> i ve held down the play pause button many times and the zune software is up to date </s>
<s> call it in and see where they want you to send it </s>
<s> if this is a recent purchase do call the support or repair side of zune </s>
<s> pssst i wouldn t mention you used a non zune non compatible cable with it and the problem appeared </s>
<s> afterall i suspect the zune and ipod cables are different at least assume they re not interchangeable </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
