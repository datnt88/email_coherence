<s> hi i m about to start my undergrad this fall and hopefully major in industrial engineering </s>
<s> every living fibre in me is telling me to get the new macbook but i can t help but wonder if a pc would be much more suitable for my studies </s>
<s> i ll be using the laptop mainly for music movies and work </s>
<s> so mac or pc </s>
<s> what programs you will absolutely have to use for your course </s>
<s> then check to see if there is a mac equivalent </s>
<s> if there is go get a mac </s>
<s> if there isn t go get a mac load boot camp load windows and only use it for that one absolutely have to use windows program </s>
<s> the rest of the time enjoy os x would that be the macbook or the macbook pro </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> yup took your advice and asked my school to which they replied by sending me this link and by telling me that the engineering department runs windows and unix machines </s>
<s> sorry but i m a soon to be first time mac user shouldn t a mac be able to work since its based on unix </s>
<s> anyways as mrmacfixit asked i think it s going to be the 2ghz macbook and i ll throw in my own 2gb of ram </s>
<s> that the productivity software is ms office </s>
<s> available as office 2004 for mac student teacher edition 125 has everything except ms access </s>
<s> check out the on line software catalog they sell mac stuff </s>
<s> also note that their quot recommended quot computer purchase is a windows box </s>
<s> the fact that the engineering department runs unix machines does not mean that require students to have a computer that will run unix </s>
<s> i am not aware of a unix windows dual boot machine bob will comment if there is but you have an advantage as your mac has a form of unix already if you actually need a unix machine </s>
<s> your lovely new 2ghz macbook will do admirably and with boot camp will even run windows </s>
<s> good luck p </s>
