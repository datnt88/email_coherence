<s> i have been using an external hard drive as my main storage device and keeping the internal for vista </s>
<s> last week the ext </s>
<s> started losing connection to my pc and eventually dropped out completely at the weekend </s>
<s> i ve tried updating the drivers a different usb port and a different usb cable and had no luck </s>
<s> today i dismantled the ext </s>
<s> case and connected the hdd unit with a sata cable </s>
<s> when i turn on the pc and go into setup the pc lists sata 1 ide wd160 bladdy blah the internal vista runs on sata 3 ide wd500 etc </s>
<s> the ex external and sata 2 which is the dvd rom and has nothing to do with anything really </s>
<s> but if i skip the setup stage i get the message primary slave hard disk error </s>
<s> i know that the old ide drives could be set as master and slave by changing the jumpers and sata drives don t have this </s>
<s> but i can t get the second drive to work and really need help </s>
<s> what am i doing wrong </s>
<s> so try this instead </s>
<s> put it in a new enclosure </s>
<s> there is no reason for the internal sata connection to work </s>
<s> i see no sign that your vista was installed proper </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> with the sata cable from inside your computer you will also need the sata power adapter </s>
<s> if you did this please forgive me for asking </s>
<s> question when you start your pc with it connected does it spinup can you hear it or feel it </s>
<s> if it does then go to start all programs administrative tools computer managment select disk management </s>
<s> does your drive apear here </s>
<s> if not the drive is more than likely dead </s>
<s> you can take it to a repair shop and get their opinion </s>
<s> so time it can be repaired </s>
<s> i use a program called spinrite </s>
<s> it takes along time but it recovers drives and data that other techs say are dead drives </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> like playing russian roulette with bullets in every cylinder </s>
<s> if the drive is dead you re data is toast </s>
<s> if it s still running it might work in another hdd enclosure </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
