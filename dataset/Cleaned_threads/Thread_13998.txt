<s> my hardrive is going bad and i have xp home on it and don t like all the junk on the restore disk </s>
<s> my objective is to install a new hardrive with windows xp only and nothing else </s>
<s> i plan to install an xp pro upgrade after doing this </s>
<s> what is the best way to go about this </s>
<s> can i put the existing windows program files on a flash drive and boot the new hardrive with it </s>
<s> suggestions please </s>
<s> if you are planning on going to xp pro when replacing the drive you really do not need too much </s>
<s> when you buy the new drive just put xp pro on it </s>
<s> if the program is really an upgrade it just asks for the location of the previous version s install </s>
<s> i never really tried it with restore disks but you can try that </s>
<s> if that does not work then install the old drive in for just the verification maybe could be in an external enclosure and then proceed </s>
<s> others may be able to give you more info on this for a workaround or you could just use any qualifying os install disc </s>
<s> xp home install cd </s>
<s> see here that is allot of work though just for that but if it makes you feel more legal then go for it </s>
<s> if yes you do not need to reinstall xp home before upgrading to xp pro </s>
<s> all you need do is start the xp pro upgrade and when it asks about the os to be upgraded you put in the xp home cd </s>
<s> once the xp home is verified put the xp pro cd in and finish the install </s>
<s> if it doesn t work lemme know </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
