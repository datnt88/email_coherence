<s> i have a dead pc that i dont need anymore i was thinking of turning it into a tv tuner only box </s>
<s> it will sit next to my tv and be recording and such </s>
<s> it is not my main pc </s>
<s> so dont think so </s>
<s> the first probelm is its dead here is goes specs p4 2 4 256 ram 40 gig hd geforce 2 2x agp stragety buy a stick of 512 ram for 40 and adding it buying a 160gig ata hd 70 and buy a 6200 pci video card and lastly some 50 tv tuner </s>
<s> tis is like 180 i am hoping for a cheap tivo no monthly fees and another office computer if the need comes </s>
<s> ok here comes the questions 1 i belive the problem with the computer is the video card </s>
<s> when i start it up it shows nothing but no signal from the computer at frist i thought i had a dead hd but i tried a new one and it didnt work </s>
<s> but how do i instal a video card if the computer is dead </s>
<s> going from the agp slot to pci will the computer be able to know the pci slot is the video card without me telling it </s>
<s> is it just plug and play </s>
<s> they are both nvidia cards the gf2 is alot olders but so do i need to do anything to boot it with a new video card </s>
<s> 2 do you think the problem is the video card </s>
<s> 3 if it isnt teh video card what do you think it is </s>
<s> thanks ill be back to ask more questionns later </s>
<s> get the pc working </s>
<s> here sre some links that may be helpfull </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> the no signal from the computer message is generated by the monitor </s>
<s> displays from a computer go something like this </s>
<s> 1 message blinks up on the screen very quickly at power on from the graphics card s so that s ok own check </s>
<s> if graphics card isn t seated or working or has some other issue the system beeps an angry warning of gloom and doom </s>
<s> 2 cmos bios test and memory count racing numbers and the mobo s checked and fine and of course this is being displayed by the functional graphics card </s>
<s> 3 hard disk drive accessed whirr whirr ok for those and size reported along with optical drives </s>
<s> if these have failed completely you d still see 1 and 2 but the cmos check will show messages about drive failures </s>
<s> 4 black screen 5 os start up up until this point no drivers are required if any pc fails before it gets to 1 without any warning beeps you have a fundamental problem on your hands </s>
<s> if the pc is obviously powering up with fans spinning to confirm psu is working you have either a cpu problem reseating may work only if it hasn t failed or motherboard failure no fixes or things to try there </s>
<s> only those two would present a completey black screen with no warning bleeps on power up </s>
<s> determining which of these has failed isn t possible as each has to be tested independantly of each other </s>
<s> sadly your strategy won t help in the least as the pc s nervous system and its brain aren t talking although you d have bigger collection of hardware in the body of the dead pc afterwards </s>
<s> good luck geebee </s>
<s> remove your video card and try booting your pc </s>
<s> if it beeps the motherboard is functioning to some degree </s>
<s> if it doesn t the mobo is dead </s>
<s> assuming the mobo is working find a friend who d be willing to let you put the video card into their pc to test if its working </s>
<s> if circuit city is in your area get this card geforce 6200 and pop it into your pc </s>
<s> you can always return it if it doesn t work and its only 30 after rebate </s>
<s> i resevved the coputer form a person i knew who was going to throw it out </s>
<s> i didnt want it to go to waste if i could fix it so i have it in my hands now </s>
<s> first i read somewhere that you know your cpu works if the caps lights blink when one starts up the computer </s>
<s> these lights did blink dont know if it menas a nything </s>
<s> this is what happens when i power up the computer </s>
<s> i press the power button and no mater what cable or moniter i get the message quot no singal from the computer quot or equivelent </s>
<s> tried it with a sony 19inch crt gateway 17 inch crt and dell 1907 ultrasharp </s>
<s> the psu and cpu and case fan all spin </s>
<s> the video card is passive so i dont know about it </s>
<s> the cd drive blinks 3 times and the motherboard interior light glows green </s>
<s> but on the outside the light glows orange </s>
<s> what ive done </s>
<s> the soundcard it think is dead the owner said he lost sound a few months after he purchased it </s>
<s> havent hooked it up to speakers anyway </s>
<s> tried replacing the video card with no luck </s>
<s> the computer has an agp slot i asume it is 2x agp there is a geforce 2 mx 200 in it remember i didnt own the computer when it worked </s>
<s> the owner said he came back from vacation and it was dead </s>
<s> no error messages no nothing </s>
<s> also i was reading pc gamer and it had ways of troubleshooting a dead pc </s>
<s> the only one that looked like my pc was the video card </s>
<s> and maybe the cpu in the video card section they said quot video card erros manifest themselves in different ways from game crashes to denying your monitor a signal quot or in cpu they state quot cpu error are generally catastrophic a falty chip means your pc won t evenget up in teh morning quot so i used a can of air and made sure it was never overclocked and asked the old owner lastly if i instal a geforce 6200 pci will the computer know to use it as teh video card </s>
<s> if not what should i do </s>
<s> should i hear beep codes without speakers or a working sound card </s>
<s> dont know if i told you before but the computer is some model of the micron millenium </s>
