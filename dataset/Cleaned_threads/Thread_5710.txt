<s> currently pcs put the monitor in power save mode but the monitor is still consuming some power </s>
<s> in an enterprise a single building may have hundreds or thousands of pcs </s>
<s> more money would be saved if the monitor is completely shut down </s>
<s> the savings is beyond the power consumed by the monitor </s>
<s> any electronic device creates heat </s>
<s> this heat has to be pumped out later when the air conditioning is turned back on </s>
<s> this also costs money and is a comnplete waste </s>
<s> a slow drip in a tub will fill the tub </s>
<s> savings can be done by building the pc with a plug in the back to power the monitor </s>
<s> if the pc is inactive for a configuarable time limit different than the screen saver limit then the pc will shut power off to the monitor </s>
<s> this will all be moot when we all switch to laptops but in the meantime </s>
<s> monitors got their power from the pc s power supply </s>
<s> that s why old pc s had that weird plug </s>
<s> but the amount of power drawn by a sleeping lcd monitor is trivial most are less than 1 watt </s>
<s> someone microwaving popcorn will offset the savings </s>
<s> likewise lcds give off practically no heat when asleep </s>
<s> and that excess heat from your pc can actually reduce your heating bills in the winter </s>
<s> works for me every time power consumption for computers is a big deal </s>
<s> for example a couple of the big names yahoo msoft located new centers near my in law s home specifically because the county has among the lowest electrical costs in the us the electrical costs are a significant portion of their expense </s>
<s> another e g a single quot super computer quot will use as much electricity as a medium large town </s>
<s> it s expensive in monetary terms let alone if you consider the environmental effects </s>
<s> it seems to me the industry has been rather slow to wake up and care there s just little no emphasis or interest in consumer markets </s>
<s> awareness is the first step </s>
<s> i went to the extreme here and ordered up a p3 power meter </s>
<s> my home entertainment system was drawing 65 watts when off </s>
<s> it s now at less than half that but my point is that we need to know where the drain is in order to do more about it </s>
<s> one of my recent savings was not my choice </s>
<s> our fridge died and the new one is some 70 bucks a year estimated </s>
<s> i seem to remember the old one was closer to 300 or more </s>

<s> the practical quot green advice quot for frigs in general if over 5yrs </s>
<s> old pitch it or donate </s>
<s> don t move it to the garage for liquids coolers but actually get rid of it </s>
<s> or at least use the newest frigs you got to do the same </s>
<s> the energy saving matters over time but may not for short usage like in a summer cabin cottage but again if you re really out there any saving is worth it </s>
<s> i wonder what they say about those old gmc frigitaire models that ran for 30yrs </s>
<s> at my house meter it barely turns my consumption is as low as it goes </s>
<s> but i m sure the frig is the biggest power user after the electrical water heater </s>
