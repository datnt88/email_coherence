<s> my external hard disk is virus affected and i can t access it using windows but i can access it using ubuntu but some of the files movies in it can t be copied to my computer using ubuntu especially large files small files are getting copied while copying large files the speed of copying get reduced slowly from 10mb s to 1 2mb s and finally the process get stuck and a dialogue box appear with the writing quot an error occured while copying file quot i haven t installed ubuntu in my system i am using it from a dvd so can anyone help me to solve this problem </s>
<s> the drive is partitioned and formatted </s>
<s> if you re using fat32 on the system you ll experience what you re seeing </s>
<s> there are file size limits as well as folder limits </s>
<s> you said the external drive is virus quot affected quot but i m not sure what that means </s>
<s> an external drive cannot run virus code on its own </s>
<s> it can contain files with virus code if that s what you mean </s>
<s> it can also have damaged files so maybe you can explain the symptoms that led to your conclusion </s>
<s> in any event you might be able to copy the files to another external drive rather than to your pc drive if you can come up with such </s>
<s> as well your ubuntu might be able to burn files to either an image or to dvd if it will allow disk swapping </s>
<s> my current os is windows 7 when i plug my external hard disk in my compter my computer couldn t load the drive the symbol of the external hard disk is appearing in quot my computer quot but i can t access it and windows tell me to fomat my hard disk to make it funtioning but i can access it in ubuntu but can t copy files </s>
<s> in the post steven offered that still applies if you have true corrupted files and the file limits are still imposed </s>
<s> ubuntu offers you the chance but if the files over the fat32 limits then really you ve gone as far as you can go </s>
<s> understand you have a hosed ext </s>
<s> drive that win7 sees as corrupted fat structure and ubuntu sees that too it does use the same fat32 structure or similar but very large files usually cause a problem above 4gb thus a limit </s>
<s> on top of that you still have some corruption which adds to the issue </s>
<s> you may want to try some quot recovery s w quot that hopefully can repair the corruption and or allow under win7 to retrieve data </s>
<s> this all takes time so don t be surprised if this is a long process </s>
<s> next time store precious data in multiple media as ext </s>
<s> drives should be considered temporary at best </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thank you friend </s>
