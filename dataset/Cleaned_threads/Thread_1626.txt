<s> one of my old pcs finally died a while back and the other day i received a replacement i ordered online which uses win2kpro </s>
<s> unfortunately it didn t come with a modem installed </s>
<s> i installed a quot netodragon 56k voice modem quot but am for some reason unable to connect to the internet using msn 8 i installed msn 8 and chose quot i ve already signed up quot and was immediately greeted with the following error message quot we re sorry we cannot sign you up for msn because there is a problem with your computer or the msn service </s>
<s> please try again later quot the driver for the modem is installed and i can use the quot internet connection wizard quot which successfully connects to the quot microsoft internet referral service quot so apparently the modem is working </s>
<s> i ve never had to install a modem on a computer having had them already installed when i bought them and thus have absolutely no idea what to do here </s>
<s> can anyone help with this problem </s>
<s> note if you re asking for technical help please be sure to include all your system info including operating system model number and any other specifics related to the problem </s>
<s> my first guess is that windows 2000 isn t properly installed </s>
<s> try installing the latest motherboard chipset drivers </s>
<s> i copied the forum note since without those details i can t be more specific </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> operating system windows 2000 professional says windows 98se on the case model case says it is a quot compaq deskpro en quot </s>
<s> under system properties it says system microsoft windows 2000 5 00 2195 service pack 4 computer x86 family 6 model 8 stepping 3 at at compatible 261 552 kb ram </s>
<s> compaq make hundreds of that model line </s>
<s> it s not specific enough to find the drivers but you can try compaq com bob </s>
<s> i managed to find and download the drivers for the chipset which had no effect </s>
<s> any other ideas </s>
<s> i don t know the details of the machine so i m going to call it a dead modem </s>
<s> try another </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had already tried three different modems all had the same result </s>
<s> but it seems there was never any problem with the modem to begin with </s>
<s> after a bit of digging i managed to find an old trial cd for a different isp and installed it </s>
<s> it worked </s>
<s> i was able to connect to the internet and visit websites without any errors </s>
<s> i used the guest sign in feature in msn 8 after going online and that even worked </s>
<s> apparently the problem is on msn s end not mine </s>
<s> even while connected to the internet the sign up wizard was saying i was offline </s>
<s> now all i have to do is hope msn customer service doesn t put me on hold and forget about me again </s>
<s> but the forums work best when the forum notes are followed </s>
<s> the make model helps everyone give the best answers </s>
