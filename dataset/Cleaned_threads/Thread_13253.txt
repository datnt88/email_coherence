<s> i am planning for an upgrade a cheap upgrade at least </s>
<s> these are recent specs intel pentium d 2 66 ghz see it here ddr 400 1gb 2 hdd western digital 320gb sata and samsung 40gb ide internal video card 32mb windows xp sp2 i need advices on what hardware software should i put in to keep it fast </s>
<s> i also have plans of playing high spec games like call of duty 4 left for dead xmen origins etc but i was worrying about the bus speed of my motherboard </s>
<s> i still use ddrs which has 400mhz transfer rate meaning i use an old motherboard i forgot the brand sorry </s>
<s> if i reached at least minimum specs of these games can i still play these games smoothly under these bus speeds </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i d say make a minimalist install of freebsd with xfce blackbox lxsession or fluxbox as the window manager but then you wouldn t have games </s>
<s> external video card with enough memory for the game </s>
<s> windows sucks and is insecure but since you insist on using it only install the basics you need </s>
<s> well i hope you re not promoting a product eh </s>
<s> uhm let me see i think i won t opt to change my os and i think freebsd is a gamble since you said quot but then you wouldn t have games quot </s>
<s> thanks anyway </s>
<s> lt i gt lt b gt quot external video card with enough memory for the game quot lt i gt lt b gt so if i upgraded to let s say 2gb ddr for a 2gb required game would it be performing the same as a 2gb ddr2 machine runing the same game </s>
<s> meaning bus speeds won t affect gameplay is that what you mean </s>
<s> same for the video card thinggy my slot says agp 8x </s>
<s> i don t have pci e i think </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> look on google shopping for agp 8x </s>
<s> let s assume that you will need 256m as a minimum </s>
<s> part of the game performance or any performance depends on how much memory goes to graphics </s>
<s> my card is embedded so i lose up to 128m memeory and up to 98 cpu when rendering occurs </s>
<s> well complying with the memory is an easy task since we can just readily buy the card with the appropriate memory </s>
<s> but how bout the bus speed </s>
<s> that s already becoming my concern </s>
<s> changing the bus speed means changing the motherboard right </s>
<s> i think i won t be resorting to that </s>
<s> it s like buying a new pc already </s>
<s> i hope i could get a specific answer </s>
<s> thanks anyway </s>
