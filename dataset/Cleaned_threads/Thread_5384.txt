<s> i have a dell dimension 8300 with a geforce fx 5200 card installed </s>
<s> i am looking at getting a widescreen hdtv with a native resolution of 1386x788 will my video card support that resolution </s>
<s> i haven t been able to find any info that will tell me if it will support any widescreen resolutions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> finds some discussion about this </s>
<s> however there are 22 fx5200 cards out there and i can t know if yours has a compatible dvi connection </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have a 5200 and stepping through the setting it doesn t show on mine </s>
<s> but it should support a lesser value at max </s>
<s> mine of 1280x1024 </s>
<s> there are various vendors using the fx5200 series chipset but it should be very similar outputs </s>
<s> in short its not a good marriage but may work as to what you hdtv range will allow </s>
<s> enjoy willy </s>
<s> i finally took the plunge and bought the sony kdf42we655 lcd rear projection hdtv </s>
<s> so great hooked up to my pc </s>
<s> the only problem is it turns out the tv doesn t accept high resolutions from the pc </s>
<s> in fact for now i m stuck using s video to get a half decent 1024x728 resolution the hdmi cable only allowed 640x400 or 640x480 </s>
<s> but i have the tv set on wide zoom mode which stretches the picture a little but still looks great </s>
<s> gotta look more into software to beef of my hdmi resolutions </s>
<s> try notice an older free version is at the link </s>

<s> thanks </s>
<s> i ll give it a shot </s>
<s> any recommendations for a tutorial or is it pretty self explanatory </s>
<s> i think bruises are the usual badges of learning this one </s>

<s> just wanted to say thanks for the help i got everything set up the tv looks great </s>
<s> in case anyone has similar questions i ended up not using powerstrip at all </s>
<s> turns out the updated drivers to the geforce 5200 which i had previously ignored due to s video problems made the pc to tv hookup with an hdmi to dvi cable easy as 1 2 3 final pc configuration at least for now 3 ghz pentium 1 7 tb hdd internal and external 2 gb ram 42 quot widescreen hi def sony quot monitor quot geforce 5200 graphics card audigy 2 zs audio logitech z 680 surround speakers logitech wireless keyboard mouse ati video capture card pci </s>
