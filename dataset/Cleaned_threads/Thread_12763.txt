<s> last night i built a pc for the first time </s>
<s> i think i was pretty methodical and made all the right connections </s>
<s> when i turn on the computer it seems like everything is fine </s>
<s> it sees the graphics card the cpu the ram and both hard drives </s>
<s> the dvd drive and the keyboard both work </s>
<s> the 4 case fans all come on </s>
<s> the cpu fan and the power supply fan both come on </s>
<s> the interior blue lights come on </s>
<s> then after about 40 seconds it just shuts off </s>
<s> no beeping no error message it just turns off </s>
<s> it doesn t matter what it s doing at the time </s>
<s> if i hit delete to go into the bios while i m in there it will just turn off </s>
<s> or if i let it boot from the vista cd it ll be on a screen with a progress bar saying quot windows is loading files quot it will get about a third of the way through the progress bar and then shut off </s>
<s> my biggest concern is that everything seems to be working perfectly and then it shuts down and i don t know how i will find the problem </s>
<s> any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated </s>

<s> the owner didn t put on the heatsink compound </s>
<s> they thought it was optional </s>
<s> the instruction portion of the manual is just a series of pictures and it didn t say anything about using a heatsink compound there s no text to that effect it s not represented in the pictures and no compound was provided in the packaging </s>
<s> 1 are you certain this is the problem </s>
<s> 2 have i done damage to the cpu permanent or temporary </s>
<s> 3 once i put the compound on will i be able to take the heatsink off again is it like glue </s>
<s> i ask this because i ve taken the heatsink off about three times to make various connections in areas that i couldn t access when the heatsink was in place </s>
<s> i apologize about my ignorance </s>
<s> thank you very much for the help </s>
<s> i m off to buy a heatsink compound </s>
<s> i ll look for your response when i return </s>
<s> let s try google to learn about heatsink compound </s>
<s> i think that covers it </s>
<s> gt about your supplied instructions there is an issue here </s>
<s> if they supplied all the information then the costs go up and you risk infuriating those that build computers all the time </s>
<s> go light and your new builders may not know since they didn t take a class or ask </s>
