<s> i have a non branded pc that my brother in law put together for himself and the passed it over to me </s>
<s> it has a amd x52 chip and runs on xp pro </s>
<s> i have a constant problem of where it boot s up everyday mysteriously </s>
<s> i always shut it down completely in the evening </s>
<s> without fail in the morning it is running </s>
<s> i have the mcafee virus and spyware scan but doesn t seem to pick up anything </s>
<s> if i shut the main switch behind then it does not start up on it s own </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> 1 other people </s>
<s> 2 wake on lan modem etc settings </s>
<s> 3 the bios has that feature to wake at a scheduled time </s>
<s> it sounds like the bios has a startup timer in it </s>
<s> just disable it </s>
<s> a dumb question </s>
<s> how do i get into the bios </s>
<s> is that at startup </s>
<s> to get into the bios you have to do it before the windows startup screen </s>
<s> it is the screen that you see where it says press a key to enter cmos or bios </s>
<s> this key is probably delete f1 or whatever else it says </s>
<s> after you press the correct key you should be taken to a blue or gray screen </s>
<s> just look through there don t tamper with anything that you don t know what it is and find something to the effect of a timer </s>
<s> when you find the timer just disable it </s>
<s> oh and the bios is controlled with the keyboard there is no mouse </s>
<s> and be sure when you find and disable the timer save the settings </s>
<s> to save it it is usually the f10 key if not it should say how at the bottom of the bios screen </s>
<s> everything except the quot pme event wakeup quot was enabled quot i am going to disable that and try it </s>
<s> that s probably it because pme stands for quot power management event quot </s>
