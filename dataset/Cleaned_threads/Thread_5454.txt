<s> hi all could any tell me how does an access point without nat tables know the clients in vicinity </s>
<s> i am not asking in terms of radio signal reception but what i want to know is does the ap maintain a table list structure with the ssid of clients or its mac address or its ip address </s>
<s> if yes where does it keep it </s>
<s> in the sense in which file system of its os </s>
<s> also a wireless router operates at netwok layer level maintaing nat tables and inspecting packets at that level and routing ip packets </s>
<s> i assume in both wireless router case and ap s case they must do the client detection at the physical layer level </s>
<s> how does this detection recored before sending the packets higher up the stack in case of wireless router </s>
<s> i assume in case of ap it just detects clients and routes the wlan packet directly to client </s>
<s> is this true </s>
<s> it is important for me to know this as we want to tweak the ap wireless router for some security needs </s>
<s> but in short i set the wap to use wpa and if possible wpa2 then use the wap </s>
<s> as to how things work you can find books on that subject </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> a router uses 3 layers of the osi model up to and including the network layer </s>
<s> this layer is where packets are router to different subnets using ip s </s>
<s> wap s and or ap s use up to and including layer 2 the data link layer </s>
<s> to answer your question an ap deals with mac addresses and it keeps them in a re writable rom chip eeprom </s>
<s> each layer adds encapsulation going up the stack </s>
<s> then is there an arp table or some table with a match of ssid and mac address stored in this rom of wap which tells about the clients </s>
<s> much like the arp table dynamics there is a one to one and or one to many relationship between ssid s and mac s which is stored on eeproms in the ap </s>
