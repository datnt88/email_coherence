<s> my computer does not start immediately when i pushed the start on button </s>
<s> i have to wait about about 20 minutes after the first push on button then off and on a couple of time again only this time it starts </s>
<s> the motherboard is asus p5e3 premium wifi os is windows vista ultimate cpu intel core quad q6600 ram 6gb and graphic card ati radeon hd 4800 before i had blue screen problems somehow it was solved </s>
<s> i also updated the bios to fix the problems </s>
<s> is my motherboard the root cause of this problem </s>
<s> should i replace a new motherboard </s>
<s> this my first built computer i had couple of times change the cpu heat sink </s>
<s> sounds to me like a power supply issue </s>
<s> maybe the psu is crapping out and is just barely able to supply the juice for your setup </s>
<s> repeated on off cycles won t help in the long run </s>
<s> it maybe actually causing or adding to the problem to be further on or start corruption </s>
<s> in this scenario the corruption gets corrected but takes times and will boot </s>
<s> at the same time the boot up just hasn t gotten shorter then you hit the on off sw you may find yourself totally unable to boot with the corruption problem alone </s>
<s> i suggest you back up any critical data etc </s>
<s> and then reload the os again </s>
<s> if you have restore recovery disc s you may want to do a quot repair quot when the menu appears </s>
<s> depending on your setup under vista that maybe hitting f8 or any key sequence that allows the menu to appear </s>
<s> doing a repair mode basically quot refresh quot the os </s>
<s> if will also correct minor issues if present </s>
<s> if that does settle down the start up problem you can then think a total os reload </s>
<s> you can also try getting the latest drivers for all devices involved as well beforehand in order to load the latest before trying the repair or os reload </s>
<s> having the latest drivers will help when needed to return the pc back to the best condition </s>
<s> if none of this helps then you re free to think quot new quot or proceed with other options that require a newer system </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i forgot to mention you may want to look for a better psu </s>
<s> the wattage you have may not be capable or a weak leg of the power is stressed </s>
<s> also since you mentioned replaced heatsinks be 100 sure the cpu hsf is properly attached and rated for your cpu </s>
<s> that a small amt </s>
<s> of thermo goop is all you need excess actually hurts here </s>
<s> also beware of using thermo goop where the manufacturer has already placed a thermo pad remove pad and use goop </s>
<s> otherwise idf properly installed the thermo pad will suffice </s>
<s> willy </s>
<s> i think the p5e3 has been spotted with those bad caps see google yes it could be an old psu but besides what folk have written inspect motherboard power supply and all cards for bad caps </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for all of your information </s>
<s> my psu is corsair hx520w i think it is not very old </s>
<s> this computer is my first built and now it is my secondary computer </s>
<s> i will try with another psu and i will try to find out about bad caps </s>
<s> once it started i can use as long as i like and there is no problems of reboot too </s>
<s> regards wildbird </s>
<s> quot once it started i can use as long as i like and there is no problems of reboot too quot that s bad caps for you </s>
<s> you just wrote the symptom we expect when there are bad caps see google </s>
