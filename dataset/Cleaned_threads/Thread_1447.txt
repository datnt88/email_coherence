<s> hi i m new to this forum but i really need to find out how important the gpu clock speed is regarding graphics cards </s>
<s> i m probably either gonna get a bfg nvidia 7600 gs oc 512mb card which has 420mhz clock speed or an xfx geforce 7600 gt xxx edition 256mb card which has 590mhz clock speed </s>
<s> both cards have a memory clock speed of 800mhz </s>
<s> can anyone help me with deciding which one would be better </s>
<s> i think the one with 512mb would be better but i honestly have no idea how important the gpu clock speed is </s>
<s> any help is much appreciated </s>
<s> a gs would need 100mhz to be close to a gt </s>
<s> well yeah it s got a higher speed but the slower one has double the memory </s>
<s> i mean i do intend to play quite a few games using the card i m gonna buy </s>
<s> should the amount of ram i already have affect the decision i make about the graphics card </s>
<s> i should have 1 25gb ram by the end of the week </s>
<s> 512mb is only of benefit at very high resolutions 1600x1200 1920x1200 </s>
<s> a 7600gs nor the 7600gt aren t fast enough to handle games at those resolutions </s>
<s> you d need a 7900gtx to really take advantage of 512mb </s>
<s> yes but a 7900gtx is a tad outta my budget say if i had to stay with the 7600 series you re recommending the 256 mb with 590mhz rather than the 512mb 420mhz </s>
<s> i suppose it is a matter of the card being able to use all the memory sufficiently i d need an agp version as well i don t have pcie slots </s>
<s> do you know any good sites for graphics cards </s>
<s> dude for pc hardware and electronics you got to go to newegg com </s>
<s> they have some of the lowest prices they are fast and their customer support it outstanding </s>
<s> ah yes that site was just recommended to me earlier today </s>
<s> tell me what do you think of the gainward bliss 7800gs agp </s>
