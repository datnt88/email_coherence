<s> i have a data disk that i recently burned on my dvd burner </s>
<s> the disk was nearly full </s>
<s> now when i try to access a couple of the files on the disk towards the end of the list on either one of my dvd drives on my system i have both a burner and a straight dvd drive i can t access them </s>
<s> it just stuggles with them and does t play the files are movies </s>
<s> but i tried playing them on a system at staples and they played fine with no problem </s>
<s> i have noticed some problems before accessing files on full dvd s </s>
<s> my system consists of a pentium 4 running at 2 53 ghz 256 meg memory 2 160 gb hd s 1 dvd r burner and one dvd drive all running under windows me </s>
<s> i know windows me has a 4 gb file size limit thought maybe that limitation was causing the problem </s>
<s> any input would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> if the disc is readable on the dvd recorder then you are proving that the failing dvd drive is just getting old </s>
<s> some will go into denial over that but we just wait and let the drive fail more and more until the owner caves in and tries a new drive </s>
<s> for now try a cd dvd lens cleaner </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had considered the possibility of a drive going out but two drives at once </s>
<s> along with that the fact that the same drive that i burned the dvd with won t play all of it </s>
<s> i suppose it s possible but the fact that neither drive will play all the files has me scratching my head </s>
<s> i used a lens cleaner on the drives today regrettably didnt help any </s>
<s> one bad one can interfere with the other </s>
<s> it s why you test each on their own </s>
<s> and try a new ide cable common failure point </s>
<s> be sure to try a known working drive so you don t waste your days with bad drives </s>
