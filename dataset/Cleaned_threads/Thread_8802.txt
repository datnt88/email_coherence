<s> ok here is what happened </s>
<s> i have an external 160gb usb </s>
<s> i was trying to open a folder and it went into not responding mode </s>
<s> i know i shouldn t but i was frustrated so i just unplugged it </s>
<s> once i did that i got the bubble for a write error i don t know the exact wording </s>
<s> now i had just transferred something to it but i thought is was done as the transfer notice went away </s>
<s> so now the computer does not see the hard drive anywhere </s>
<s> i have check disk management i have check bios and i have done this at home and on my work computer </s>
<s> now while i would like to save the hard drive what i really need is some of the data </s>
<s> does anyone have any ideas for getting the computer to recognize the drive again </s>
<s> i have a program to get the data back but first the computer needs to see the drive </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> the best cheap strategy is to pull the hard disk out of it s casket and put it into a desktop or new usb enclosure </s>
<s> good luck bob </s>
<s> i ve read where putting the hd into the freezer and cooling it down temporarily gets it to work sometimes long enough to get data off of it </s>
<s> the freezing cold changes the metal size and allows the stuck platter to spin again so i assume </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> it is at least worth a try since nothing else is allowing it to be recognized at this point </s>
