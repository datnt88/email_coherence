<s> hello i have an ibook g3 and when i start it i get the folder question mark in the middle of the screen </s>
<s> i wanted to try with the hardware test disk but i can not insert the disk </s>
<s> the door want open </s>
<s> is there a way to open the door other than pressing f12 key </s>
<s> thanks j k </s>
<s> on the door of the cd tray you will see a small hole </s>
<s> take a straightened paper clip preferably one that fits in the hole and gently push it into the hole </s>
<s> you should hear a little click and then the tray will open </s>
<s> before you do that make sure that you do not already have a cd in the tray it should be visible on the desktop if there is one in there and if there is drag it to the trash </s>
<s> that will make it eject </s>
<s> of course if there is nothing in there do the first suggestion let us know what happens p </s>
<s> thank you for the suggestion it worked </s>
<s> i opened the door by using a paper clip </s>
<s> now i have a problem that the door won t close </s>
<s> sometimes it needs a little persuasion right at the end p </s>
<s> i managed to close the door </s>
<s> when holding the c key c letter not ctrl key </s>
<s> nothing happens </s>
<s> when holding down the alt key i get 2 icons each with an arrow inside </s>
<s> one straight arrow pointing to the right and the other curved like unclosed circle pointing also to the right </s>
<s> and a cursor in the shape of a watch </s>
<s> nothing happens when clicking either icons </s>
<s> after a long while text appears where among other things it is written 8243 type mac boot and press return 8221 but nothing happens when i do that </s>
<s> any suggestions what i could do next </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> hold it down at the first chime and keep it down until you see the grey apple and the spinning wheel </s>
<s> the option key will show you all available boot disks that the system sees </s>
<s> they are represented by the icons that you saw </s>
<s> if it does not display the cd that you have inserted then the system does not recognise it as a valid startup disk </s>
<s> this could be because the cd drive is defective or that the disk itself is not correct or is damaged </s>
<s> the flashing question mark indicates that the system cannot find the system folder on the hd </s>
<s> either a corrupt system or a dead hd </s>
<s> keep trying the quot c quot route for a while </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> unfortunately 8243 c 8221 route did not work </s>
<s> i can hear the cd drive beginning to spin but then only folder with the question mark appears again </s>
