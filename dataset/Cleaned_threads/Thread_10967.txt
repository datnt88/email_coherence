<s> my m b is a asus p5ld2 vm the chipset is intel 82945g the cpu is dual core and runs at 26 6 ghz and i have 4 gigs of ram </s>
<s> i want to install a 3d video card to improve the display </s>
<s> presently i m using the onboard video </s>
<s> i need a suggestion for buying a compatable video card that will give me the best performance for the price </s>
<s> any other suggestions are welcomed </s>
<s> i would like to stay under 250 </s>
<s> you need to be a little more precise about the circumstances under which you want to improve the display </s>
<s> do you mean for general use for games for cad cam etc </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i realize that to get really serious about games would require much money </s>
<s> presently the only thing i m thinking about is using 3d with google earth </s>
<s> i also have quot ms flight simulator x quot and the quot ls99 golf quot game </s>
<s> i just increased my ram from 1 to 4 gigs but i haven t noticed much improvement in the performance of the computer </s>
<s> i suspect that i m not running anything that requires that much ram </s>
<s> my fear is that i ll spend a lot of money on a card that may not be compatabile to my system or may not be any better than what i now have </s>
<s> thanks in advance for the help </s>
<s> but believe you can buy a plenty decent pci e 16x video card for under 250 </s>
<s> let us know how it goes you can check the performance of the various gpus units there too </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> thanks for the advice </s>
<s> i wasn t going to go into the store and just pick up one and the advice of the so called tech people in the stores near is horrible </s>
<s> i installed a geforce 9400 gt 1 gb ddr2 </s>
<s> it was reletively inexpensive about 75 w tax </s>
<s> on google earth ad the flight simulator the performace was much better </s>
<s> i haven t tried the golf game yet but i m well pleased </s>
<s> i was ready to pay much more </s>
<s> thanks agian jerry </s>
