<s> your help advice is sought </s>
<s> i have a sony 50 quot lcd wega hd tv with a hdmi jack that i would like to use as a computer monitor </s>
<s> i am not in need of the functionality of a windows media pc </s>
<s> windows xp pro will work fine </s>
<s> my main interest goal is to be able to use a pc probably a desktop as a gateway to my home network with an emphasis on displaying the browser and crusing the internet </s>
<s> any suggestions or directions where i can find a confirmation of a solid pc configuration and any tweaks i need to be aware of or plan for </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> jhh </s>
<s> does the tv have a monitor port </s>
<s> no port labeled quot monitor quot but other threads have said a dvi to hdmi cable into the hdmi port that is on the tv cable will work </s>
<s> you can use a dvi to hdmi cable to connect your computer to the tv </s>
<s> this should work fine </s>
<s> the hard part it to get it to display correctly </s>
<s> i assuming your sony tv is a 1280 x 720 progressive display </s>
<s> one would think all you would need to do is set you computer to display 1280 x 720 x 32 bitdepth resolution from the dvi port of the computer </s>
<s> if your lucky and your tv will allow it this is all you have to do </s>
<s> the problem is that the hdmi standard included an overscan specification that most tv will ahear to </s>
<s> this means that when your computer displays 1280 x 720 the image will be overscanned and the edges of the image will be cut off from your screen </s>
<s> for example only the top blue line of the start bar will be visable and the rest of the start bar will be cut off below the screen </s>
<s> there are methods to solve this thought </s>
<s> one is to use a custom resolution that will not be cut off ie 1200 x 666 </s>
<s> another way is to use non standard custom scan rates </s>
<s> somtimes you may need to do both </s>
<s> there is a shareware program that will alow computers to do this called powerstrip </s>
<s> a place you can look for more imformation is do a search on your tv model number and the word quot powerstrip quot or quot htpc quot </s>
<s> hopefully someone will have already solved this problem for you and list how they did it </s>
<s> i hope this is usefull to you </s>
<s> hi there sorry if this is in the wrong section but im new to this forum business lol i bought an lg hdtv 32lg5700 today along with an lg rht387h hdd dvd recorder with 1080p upscaling plus an hdmi cable to connect them with </s>
<s> i set them up along with my sky box as instructed and everything worked fine up until i tried to test out a dvd i selected the hdmi port that the player was connected to the tv with and i got a picture but when i try to play a dvd or even try to go to the player s options menu the tv switches to the other hdmi port it has built in and says no signal which is no surprise since i only have the one hd device connected up when i switch the cable over to the other hdmi port and try again the tv does exactly the same thing but in reverse if you know what i mean funnily enough when i connect the hdd dvd player up with a regular scart cable everything works as it should is there a problem with the tv or am i missing something </s>
<s> if anyone needs extra info just ask and i ll try my best to accomodate </s>
<s> thanks </s>
