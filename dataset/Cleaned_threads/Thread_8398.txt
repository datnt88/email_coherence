<s> this may a well beaten subject but i must get an answer </s>
<s> i have used an iomega external hd black series 800 firewire for about 6 months using it to load up with important files </s>
<s> now all of a sudden it does get recognized by either my mac g5 os x 10 4 or my macbook pro </s>
<s> in fact i get the disk insertion initialize ignore eject window </s>
<s> why initialize that will only wipe out all of my files on the hd </s>
<s> why ignore that wont help </s>
<s> why eject thats no use </s>
<s> please help any advice </s>
<s> frustrated now angry </s>
<s> but the lesson here looks to be one about backup </s>
<s> these drives are not quot storage quot bob </s>
<s> thanks ill try disk warrior </s>
<s> any other disk apps </s>
<s> that would recommend </s>
<s> i always considered the iomega external hd as a storage device </s>
<s> was this a mistake </s>
<s> i did use the backup feature although not on a regular basis which is probably a big mistake </s>
<s> but with each storage device we also have a backup of what we don t want to lose </s>
<s> please post in one of our mac forums as our mac expert will then see your issue as well </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> backup of what </s>
<s> what amount of data can a recover </s>
<s> the iomega hd does have automatic backup app should i consider </s>
<s> by the way the hd has a ms dos file system with a dos_fat_32 partition type </s>
<s> i also have posted my problem on the mac forum as well thanks for the suggestion </s>
<s> backup is defined quite well out there </s>
<s> it s that copy you have put somewhere for the day your hard disk or such device goes wonky </s>
<s> where is that backup </s>
<s> quot dos_fat_32 partition type quot that s the worst possible file system to trust for usb hard disks </s>
<s> i always feel sad when i see those </s>
<s> good luck bob </s>
<s> making a quot backup quot means making a copy of the data on another medium so you can quot restore quot it if anything happens to the original </s>
<s> usual ways to backup data on an internal hard disk is copying it to a second inernal disk or an external hard disk copying it to a usb drive burning it to cd or dvd copying to a tape drive copying it to a drive somewhere else in the home or office network </s>
<s> usual ways to backup data on an external hard disk are more or less the same </s>
<s> generally it are rather large amounts of data so the easiest way is to use a second external disk </s>
<s> i assume the iomega software is meant to copy data from an internal hard disk to the external one </s>
<s> not about copying data from it </s>
<s> fat32 disks are more error prone than disks in the ntfs for windows or apple filesystem format </s>
<s> so the first thing to do with an external disk that doesn t need to be used on both windows and apple is to delete the partition it comes with and make a more suitable one </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> quot the iomega hd does have automatic backup app quot backs up what you have on your pc mac to that storage unit </s>
<s> since you have two copies one on the pc mac and one on the storage unit it is not a disaster when the storage unit dies </s>
<s> you appear to have changed something so you had but one copy </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> im guessing that there is no easy solution to recovering data from my hd external disk </s>
<s> are there any recovery apps </s>
<s> disk warrior or companies that i can turn to </s>
<s> you can diy the recovery on some pc </s>
<s> here s the two titles you can try and buy if they work </s>
<s> zero assumption recovery getdataback why hasn t disk warrior be tried yet </s>
<s> you didn t tell </s>
<s> bob </s>
