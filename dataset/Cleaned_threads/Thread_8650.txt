<s> i just downloaded and used speed fan because i was concerned with the heat rising from the top of my rig </s>
<s> a blackbird 002 01b </s>
<s> the cpu and other temps are at 41c </s>
<s> the ram is at 75c </s>
<s> the ram is not liquid cooled and i believe this could be a fatal flaw in the design </s>
<s> any ideas on this kind of thing </s>
<s> seems like hp voodoo did not quite get their homework right </s>
<s> i could put the dominator ram fans in there but this should be hp s responsability </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the system monitoring s w is only as accurate as the sensor is </s>
<s> in most cases only those with sensors give a approx </s>
<s> value </s>
<s> last i recall no memory has sensors attached so its getting that info 2nd hand </s>
<s> next the system is running and that being the case its doing it job </s>
<s> if you want to cool it better then that s your option to do so </s>
<s> what you should do if it isn t already to route harnesses wiring cables to reduce airflow interference thus be cooler </s>
<s> as for hpvoodoo systems not doing their job that s debatable but i m not here for that </s>
<s> if it running ok don t fix it imho except of course add cooling if you want </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the ram temp is accurate infrared thermometer would be easiest </s>
<s> if the temp as indicated is accurate then i d check the bios for speed and voltage settings </s>
<s> hoping that will solve the problem </s>
<s> let us know </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i was a little hasty in my prognosis </s>
<s> however i have had nothing but problems with this bird </s>
<s> over 4 mos </s>
<s> in the shop </s>
<s> emails galore </s>
<s> one tech says mobo another say not </s>
<s> i have switched the gpus at the prompt from the tech </s>
<s> one of the fans southbridge or north </s>
<s> i m not sure keeps falling off </s>
<s> i m supposed to get a new one delivered but i still wait </s>
<s> i m going to get a digital pyrometer and check the temps again </s>
<s> ps </s>
<s> after shut down the usb ports on the bird are allways live </s>
<s> is this normal </s>
<s> every pc i own have owned and including friends pcs </s>
<s> none of them have power to the usb ports when the rig is off </s>
<s> i got this rig last nov this is not right </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> gone to get a digital pyrometer as soon as i can </s>
<s> i still dont think 79c is normal operating temp </s>
<s> trying to get answers reminds me of davinci code </s>
<s> why it s important to make sure the reading is accurate before going further </s>
<s> good luck getting the problems straightened out and keep us posted </s>
<s> vapcmd ps here s a link to a good infrared thermometer that can be used to troubleshoot pc or non pc heat related problems </s>
<s> thanks for the link </s>
<s> i wish i still had my fluke multimeter </s>
<s> 900 went for a walk </s>
<s> i ll let you know </s>
<s> sorry for the delayed reply well any fan that falls off isn t a good thing </s>
<s> plus even before it falls it maybe not 100 seated or unsettling factor to keep it where it suppose to be </s>
<s> these extreme machines just don t like losing any cooling and the results will be as you find </s>
<s> certainly that has to be corrected </s>
<s> the plain fact is if you can further cool the system it will be a plus for you </s>
<s> add extra fans or switch over to water cooling etc usb ports shouldn t be active in that actually still do something in any big way </s>
<s> but they are still powered the leds you see lit probably are just a minor side effect of keeping the system quot at the ready quot maybe from a wake up hibernate quot state or awaiting a hot key from the kybd that s a power setting issue or bios you may want to review that </s>
<s> however its not going to hurt the system and in some cases you may do more harm delving into all those power setting </s>
<s> if you like keep it simple place system on a power strip surge protection </s>
<s> and when done just switch it off provided you did a proper shutdown </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
