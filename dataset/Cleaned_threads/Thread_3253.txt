<s> first off i did not realise a dvd drive used two lasers to read either dvd and normal cd rom music disks </s>
<s> how long should a dvd or other optical drive last </s>
<s> my drive still plays all my music cds and can read cd roms but it will not read any of my movies any more </s>
<s> all they do is spin the drive up and then it says there is quot no disk in drive quot drive is about 14 months old </s>
<s> is this how long these things are meant to last these days </s>
<s> some machines will get months others years </s>
<s> the deciding factor i m seeing is how hot it is inside the computer case </s>
<s> while many owners learn about cpu temperatures they often neglect cooling for other parts </s>
<s> a year may be typical for a box where the drive is a bit warm </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> a few yrs </s>
<s> ago many a cd drive would last longer and the reason is the speed factor </s>
<s> as drives become more speed x they have little room for error and quot settledown quot time is nil and quickly errors out </s>
<s> however a basic cd drive is darn cheap nowadays and reflects that but quality still matters and usually will last longer excludes any other factor </s>
<s> dvd drives by default are more demanding and quite easily get tossed early after normal wear tear </s>
<s> my rule of thunb upon hearing a drive going bad is it at least 1yr </s>
<s> and used often then you got your money s worth if brought with the system </s>
<s> plus now you have the quot combo drives quot which just allows more possibilites of having a problem so there you go </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> you guys won t believe this but just today i put a dvd into the drive and it worked </s>
<s> i fell of my seat almost literally </s>
<s> i think i have solved the problem of why it did not work when i first mentioned this on monday </s>
<s> the drive has drive belts inside that spin the disk </s>
<s> i am not sure what the belts are made of but they seem to be a bit greasy to the touch and sometimes the drive won t spin properly when the disk is inside it dvd disks spin at a higher speed then normal cd or cd rom and i suspect that all this fuss might be due to the crap quality of the drive belts and this quot greasy quot substance that builds up on them </s>
