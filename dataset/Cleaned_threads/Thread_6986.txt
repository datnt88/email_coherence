<s> im having issues with my video card </s>
<s> awhile back it just started flickering and freezing up on me </s>
<s> so i assumed it was the card itself </s>
<s> i switched to the onboard video and have no problems </s>
<s> yet when i uninstall the driver for my plug and play card i can then put that card back in and as long as i dont update the card and use the default monitor it does not do any flickering or freezing </s>
<s> so im not exactly sure its the card because as long as i dont update it and use default driver for it it works fine just without any 3d </s>
<s> by the way its a nvidia geforce4 mx420 any suggestions would be appreciated </s>
<s> i d do two things </s>
<s> 1 remove the case cover to sniff out heat issues </s>
<s> 2 install the latest nvidea drivers from nvidia and not microsoft </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> have you disabled onboard vid after installing the card </s>
