<s> hello i have a hp pavillion 734n with phoenix bios </s>
<s> i tried to install a second hard drive with another xp on it </s>
<s> it booted up a couple of times then the next cold start all i get is a beeping </s>
<s> i have no monitor or floppy </s>
<s> all i got is the beeping </s>
<s> i removed the second hard drive but the beeping still continues </s>
<s> i tried to put in the restore cd s but they wouldn t boot up either </s>
<s> any help or thoughts would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks in advance bobby quot the beep quot </s>
<s> perhaps you can get a little closer to the source of your problem by looking here </s>
<s> most likely you dislodged something putting in the drive reseat video card and memory and see if that does it </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
