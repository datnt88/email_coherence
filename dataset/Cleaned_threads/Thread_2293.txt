<s> they can t be found in windows explorer or disk manager </s>
<s> when i plug in my flash drive to one it lights up and my computer makes the quot ba dump quot nice like it knows it got plugged in </s>
<s> the light on my flash drive turns on at first but turns off right away like the computer isn t reading the drive </s>
<s> i tried plugging in my mp3 player and i got the same response </s>
<s> it charged my player but it didn t read it </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> anything i missed feel free to ask </s>
<s> do you mean usb ports the female connector on the computer or usb flash drives </s>
<s> the two are very different things if it has power it should be working given that the internal headers can only connect one way and provide power and therefore a working signal so i d vote for software problem or system board oddity as in low quality connectors or something similar </s>
<s> the female connector </s>
<s> my flash drives work fine i ve tested on other computers </s>
<s> if its software is there anyway to fix it </s>
<s> i d go for reinstalling the usb device s drivers should be on the mainboard cd see if that helps out any are you getting quot insufficient power from usb hub quot errors at all </s>
<s> no but i do get messages that tey aren t high speed ports which isn t true </s>
<s> possibly they aren t getting enough power </s>
<s> where do you get the drivers </s>
<s> i m unclear on what the mainboard cd is </s>
<s> do you mean the cd for the operating system </s>
<s> it probably is the driver </s>
<s> try to searching for the manufacture of your motherboard on google </s>
<s> once you found it they should have all your drivers there download the usb controller driver </s>
<s> this is the mother board these are the drivers available for downloads </s>
<s> unless im going blind there s no drivers for the usb hubs to download </s>
<s> anywhere else to look </s>
