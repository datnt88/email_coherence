<s> i m new to the whole buying thing i used to have a buddy build them but he moved </s>
<s> i m planning on buying a desktop because i m useless at the whole building thing and i really want a pretty good gaming rig but don t want to spend a rediculous amount of money on it no more than 3000 5000 3000 is better so i still have electricity to run it </s>
<s> suggestions for companies configurations and or specs are greatly appreciated </s>
<s> at least 3 0 ghz procesor and a good amount of hd space are ideal </s>
<s> that 3ghz number is what we may have written about the old pentium 4 cpus </s>
<s> today you can pop in a nice 2 0ghz core 2 duo and that cpu will fly past the old p4 </s>
<s> i strongly suggest some reading over at tomshardware com and then consider cloning something there if you like it </s>

<s> hey buddy </s>
<s> let me start off by saying quot don t buy it </s>
<s> build it </s>
<s> quot are u still reading </s>
<s> here s why 1 you ll get the exact configuration you want for your needs 2 it s probably gonna be cheaper than pre built pcs 3 it ll be easier to upgrade in the future since you know exactly what you put in there and what it is compatible with 4 there is a ton of information and resources available on the web to instruct you on how to do it </s>
<s> you don t need to be a computer engineer or a technician </s>
<s> you just have to follow a logical sequence of steps </s>
<s> 5 it is easy and fun </s>

<s> here s a good page that explains the basic steps once you read this you ll change your mind and then look for more detailed info note that i m new to system building too </s>
<s> 3 months ago the very thought of building a pc sent shivers down my spine </s>
<s> but i have done a lot of research over the past few months about comp parts and technologies </s>
<s> now i am armed with so much information that i d feel stupid buying a pre built pc </s>
<s> assuming that you will consider my advice and think about building your pc here s some relevant info note i m planning to build a high end machine for gaming just like you are so i think that you might find my few cents on this helpful </s>

<s> these have become pretty cheap graphics evga 8800 gtx 768 mb pci e x16 graphics card </s>
<s> a good power supply unit probably gt 700w power output a good case that has room for all this and whatever else you need </s>
<s> these are the most important components </s>
<s> the rest are relatively trivial optical drives dvd burners card readers etc finally i want to include the specs i ve decided on for my computer which will be an all in one work gaming home theater system you can use this as an example or a guide </s>

<s> hey man </s>
<s> first of all if you know all your parts well and know the basic steps i don t see the hardware part of the installation taking more than 2 hours </s>
<s> the software part really depends on how many cards and other devices you have in there </s>
<s> first there is the os that s about maybe 30 minutes </s>
<s> then there s the drivers for each of your devices they will most probably come with driver cds lastly you might have to change a few bios settings like ram timing voltage etc depending on your hardware </s>
<s> but none of this is rocket science </s>
<s> regarding tech support well no one s gonna come to your house to fix anything for free unless you have a techie friend or pay geeksquad but each manufacturer has its own tech support and online forums </s>
<s> in most cases when something fails to work they ll send you a replacement if it s still under warranty </s>
<s> unless you physically damage something yourself you re covered </s>
<s> this is the only partial downside to building it yourself </s>
<s> newegg is very good when it comes to rma returned merchandise auth so don t stress out too much about this part </s>
<s> now coming to the case in order to figure out if it ll hold everything you need you just need to have a checklist of all your components and go about checking each component against the case and marking them off one by one </s>
<s> here are some things you should know internal cd dvd blu ray burners a k a </s>
<s> optical drives require external 5 25 quot drive bays internal floppy drives require external 3 5 quot drive bays most internal media card readers also require 3 5 quot bays but maybe 5 25 quot internal hard drives require internal 3 5 quot bays or racks </s>
<s> the 7 expansion slots refer to either pci or pci express slots on the motherboard which will hold your graphics card sound card network card tv tuner or similar cards </s>
<s> just add up the number of slots for these also </s>
<s> my specs require 2 pci and 1 pci express slots 1 pci sound card 1 pci tv tuner and 1 pci express graphics card so for each of these components just add up the total number of drive bays racks they need </s>
<s> for example i have in my specs 2 seagate sata hard drives and 2 optical drives dvd burners </s>
<s> this means i need 2 internal 3 5 quot bays and 2 external 5 25 quot bays </s>
<s> if i put a floppy drive in i will also need an external 3 5 quot bay </s>
<s> make sense </s>
<s> yes the case you selected is a good case and should fit everything i listed </s>
<s> the only thing that i m not 100 sure about is the evga 8800 gtx card because it is 10 5 inches in length </s>
<s> read reviews about the case and find out if anyone was able or not able to put the 8800 gtx card in </s>
<s> i think this case has enough fans already but if you feel it s getting hot in there you can always put more fans in later </s>
<s> atx refers to the form factor size of the motherboard </s>
<s> if your motherboard is atx which it most probably will be you re fine </s>
<s> i hope all this makes sense </s>
<s> feel free to ask more questions if you happen to have any </s>
<s> ciao </s>
<s> you could go for a different architecture and try a ppc or sparc chip on a mother board </s>
<s> everything that is offered to you here is going to be ia32 x86 chip or amd64 x86_64 chip </s>
<s> intel was cloned by amd and later intel cloned amd s 64 bit system </s>
<s> there is very little the manufacturer has to do with the processor type </s>
<s> what operating system are you going to use </s>
<s> this will tell you the amount of ram you need </s>
<s> minix3 and plan9 can be run on 32 megabytes of ram sometimes even 16 the more processes that are running the more memory that you will need </s>
<s> a cluttered desktop and multiple programs running which are not actively nor passively being used is wasting valuable memory </s>
<s> how much control do you have over the way the system runs </s>
<s> your hardware has to be compatible </s>
<s> are you planning on home use gaming soho server pbx file server or web server </s>
<s> it is important that only the drivers you need are loaded into the kernel to prevent bloating </s>
<s> if you cannot find the driver one can be written or modified </s>
<s> how much disk space and what is the layout </s>
<s> raid may be a safe idea if you have a home office or a file server </s>
<s> do you have a lot of traffic coming in and out such as clients </s>
<s> are you going to run through ethernet firewire or usb for this </s>
<s> will you have a graphical or non graphical environment </s>
<s> all of these are important questions that you should ask </s>
<s> you don t buy a quot dell quot or quot gateway quot or quot mac quot computer </s>
<s> the architectures are the same </s>
<s> apple has switched over to the ia32 and amd64 architectures </s>
<s> you buy and i repeat this an x86 or amd 64 and what if it is duo core </s>
<s> here </s>
<s> duo core means two processors </s>
<s> if each processor is 32bit then your system is really 32 bit </s>
<s> if each processor is 64bit then your system is 64bit </s>
<s> some of the older sparc based workstations had two chips in it </s>
<s> never ask anyone that has only used one architecture to suggest a computer to you </s>
<s> and never ask anyone who has only used one operating system </s>
<s> a brand name is not important if you know what you are doing </s>
<s> you do realize that apple is using the new efi system </s>
<s> read no windows pc maker has done that yet </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i use linux and freebsd which is a unix variant </s>
<s> i also use minix and plan9 both are unix variants also </s>
<s> again no manufacturer makes windows they install it </s>
<s> i only know of ibm sun and hp as being both manufacturers and devlopers of software systems and even then the machines have to have the system installed </s>
<s> the article points to linux using this feature since 2000 the feature is not new </s>
