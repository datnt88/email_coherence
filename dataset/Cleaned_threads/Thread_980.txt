<s> i ve had to reinstall windows 98 on an older machine and now find that my hp 6200c scanner won t work although it was perfect before </s>
<s> each time i try to start the precision pro software there s a message that the scanner cannot be found or that it cannot be initalized </s>
<s> however everything seems fine when i check the properties in the control panel </s>
<s> on the hp site there is information about installing 3 specific files to the registry which i ve done </s>
<s> since the problem persists i tried their second solution which is to use regedit version 4 0 or above </s>
<s> since my machine has an earlier version following their advice i copied regedit 5 0 from another computer </s>
<s> unfortunately it won t run indicates that a certain dll is missing </s>
<s> since i don t want to fool around with the registry blindly i m stumped </s>
<s> hp used to have very helpful forums but i see they are no longer there </s>
<s> does anyone here have a suggestion </s>
<s> i d be very grateful for any help </s>

<s> is that windows 98 was not installed fully </s>
<s> the motherboard drivers and what else are usually unknown to most people and never installed by microsoft </s>
<s> as it stands your post is incomplete and the reason you reinstalled the os is missing and more </s>
<s> best of luck figuring this out with such a limited posting </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob what more would you need to know </s>
<s> what else might i need to install </s>
<s> do you really want to know why i reinstalled windows 98 </s>
<s> it s a long story suddenly all my office programs stopped working </s>
<s> other programs too </s>
<s> nothing would open properly </s>
<s> after several days futzing around with things checking websites tweaking sending messages etc </s>
<s> i decided to repair the registry </s>
<s> since that didn t help i restored the registry </s>
<s> now things got really really bad </s>
<s> so i gave up and called dell </s>
<s> they led me through the reinstall </s>
<s> in any case because everything old is gone or on my backup drive i wonder why it s important to describe why i reinstalled windows </s>
<s> i downloaded the scanjet drivers and software from the hp site and assumed that was enough </s>
<s> what might i be missing </s>
<s> if i didn t provide enough information in my post i d really appreciate your advice on what other details i should include </s>
<s> thanks rita </s>
<s> quot note if you re asking for technical help please be sure to include all your system info including operating system model number and any other specifics related to the problem </s>
<s> quot it is still possible that windows 98 is not installed proper </s>
<s> i know it sounds gruesome but 98 or se </s>
<s> will not fetch or install drivers to make your usb ports work better than 1 2 of the time </s>
<s> it s all up to the owner to sort that out </s>
<s> in closing since you only tell it s a dell then you get to go there and find what drivers they offer </s>
