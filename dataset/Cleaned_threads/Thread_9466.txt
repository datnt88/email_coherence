<s> i m setting up a home network with a netgear rp614 router </s>
<s> i have a dell laptop running xp pro </s>
<s> i use the laptop at work where the it dept </s>
<s> has assigned static ip s to all clients </s>
<s> my ip config is as follows ip address 10 218 154 11 subnet 255 255 255 0 default gateway 10 218 154 253 primary dns 24 92 228 12 secondary 24 92 228 173 so in order to be able to use my laptop at home i envisioned setting up my router s dhcp to something like 10 218 154 100 to 10 218 154 254 but then i m not sure about the dns </s>
<s> i would need the dns to be the same as the default gateway </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> so is there a way around this </s>
<s> or another way to do this perhaps </s>
<s> you can try to add that to the list </s>
<s> it s possible to set up multiple hardware profiles with xp that would allow you to run with different settings in different locations but i can t give step by step instruction </s>
<s> some laptops come with software that will do similar </s>
<s> i know lenovo uses something called quot access connections quot which assists travelers to set up networking profiles that can be switched easily </s>
<s> you might check to see if your ip department can set that up for you </s>
<s> ok thanks for the reply steve </s>
<s> i will look into that </s>
