<s> i m an architect and about to buy a new pc as a performance upgrade to suffice architecture related software and i m in the middle of these two devices the dell xps one 27 and lenovo ideacentre a720 the highest specs model in each the two brands </s>
<s> one of the perplexing specs for me was the screen i actually can t reach a presentable unit from both to view it myself so i m unaware of the difference of screens whether the lenovo s is very good for me as an architect especially its touch ability which is good for upcoming operating systems and specific using in architecture drafting or it s not enough and the high res </s>
<s> one is the perfect especially in a 27 quot screen </s>
<s> i also care to have a device that have the specs that are up to date and even catch up with the afterwards i don t like to have a computer and just after couple of weeks or months i find that a feature has been completed developed and flipped over to be something else like the high res screen for example </s>
<s> last year s best machine is usually fine for such work </s>
<s> maybe we can compare what you use now to these </s>
<s> is it a nice step up </s>
<s> at 27 inches did you compare the dpi of the available screens </s>

<s> i m very sorry i don t understand which you mean by last year s best machine </s>
<s> and if you are questioning about my owned pc specs it s insufficient for my field work it s a 2 13 ghz core 2 duo processor with 3 gbs of ram and a 512 mbs nvidia display adapter with a normal 5400 rpm sata hard drive and a 15 4 quot screen with native resolution of 1280 x 800 and yes too if you mean by dpi the display native resolution of the screens then the xps one 27 has a resolution of 2560x1440 whilst lenovo ideacentre a720 has 1920x1080 </s>
<s> sorry when i ask about dpi it s not about the number of dots on the screen </s>
<s> here s a primer on dpi </s>
<s> while it s nice to have a higher dpi some folk explode when they can t see a single pixel change on the display when it s very small </s>
<s> so while apple s retina displays are very nice i find cad folk to have issues with very high dpi screens when drawing lines and such </s>
<s> last year s high end machine could be some i7 8gb ram etc </s>
<s> so you are talking about a 2 generation leap so it will be fine </s>
