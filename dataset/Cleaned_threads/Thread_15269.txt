<s> i m having a problem burning cds for my windows vista computer </s>
<s> namely the files do not show up in vista </s>
<s> here s a breakdown i insert a blank cd r into the dvd cd writable drive on my dell desktop computer </s>
<s> i have xp on my desktop </s>
<s> i format the blank cd r and using windows explorer i drag files on to the cd </s>
<s> computer spends several minutes burning the cd </s>
<s> before ejecting the cd i right click on it in explorer and select quot make compatible quot it spends a minute or so doing this and then ejects the cd </s>
<s> i take the cd to my notebook computer which has vista on it </s>
<s> i insert it and a windows box pops up which shows the cd but says that there are no files on it </s>
<s> i ve taken the cd back to my desktop computer and opened it on both of my cd drives with no problem </s>
<s> the files are visible and they open just fine with no errors </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i decline to write why but share that if you didn t bother with the format drag make compatible and used most cd recording software such as cdburnerxp it would work fine </s>
<s> your method is known to fail </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so what would you recommend then </s>
<s> i supplied a solution and suggestion in my first reply </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> while you ve explained that my process is quot known to fail quot you did not provide an alternative solution </s>
<s> what step s of my process are contributing to the issues i m experience </s>
<s> so i ask again what do you or anyone else reading this thread recommend </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i noted the software and method in my reply </s>
<s> i don t offer step by step replies </s>
<s> those are for our newbies forum </s>
<s> sorry but if you didn t catch my fix in my first reply it would be unlikely you would find it in further replies </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> whatever </s>
<s> save the snide remarks for someone who cares </s>
<s> i ll seek assistance elsewhere </s>
<s> quot cd recording software such as cdburnerxp it would work fine quot sorry you feel slighted </s>
<s> but in my first reply is the software free even that could get this job done </s>
<s> again i feel if you don t read the replies what good will it do to repeat the answer </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for finally offering some clarification </s>
<s> that wasn t so hard was it </s>
<s> and no this was not an issue of me not reading your reply </s>
<s> if you look at the way you phrased your initial response grammatical errors aside perhaps you could understand why anyone would have difficulty following </s>
<s> i ll try the solution you ve suggested and report back w results </s>
