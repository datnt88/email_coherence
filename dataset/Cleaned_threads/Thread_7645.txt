<s> hi i m having constant lag spikes </s>
<s> i use dpc latency checker on both my desktop using pci wifi card and my laptop i have lag spikes </s>
<s> this is a screenshot of the spikes </s>
<s> although it says its my hardware problems i doubt its true as it happens on both devices </s>
<s> as a gamer this is truly irritating </s>
<s> do you have any idea how to fix this problem </s>
<s> maybe it s the router </s>
<s> maybe it s interference with a nearby router your neighbours operating on the same or an adjacent channel </s>
<s> maybe it s a hacker using your unprotected wireless router </s>
<s> maybe it s some background program that took a millisecond of the cpu or windows doing its housekeeping </s>
<s> for gaming it s adviced to use a wired connection </s>
<s> with a desktop that s usually easy to do since it stays on the same position so it s a one time operation to have a cable there </s>
<s> the same of course if you use your laptop usually at the same place and not so often at other locations when at home </s>
<s> it s worth an experiment at least because it eliminates all wireless issues hackers interference the wireless logic of the router </s>
<s> changing the channel you use of course is a very easy test </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> wifi is in the wide open so a neighbor another pc or a microwave oven can interfere </s>
<s> gamers learn quickly that wifi is not the connection of choice </s>
<s> eventually they move back to the wired connection and even turn off the wifi in the router </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> absolutely that isn t uncommon and as you said if you are gaming wireless is not the way to go too many variables can bounce around like a yo yo </s>
