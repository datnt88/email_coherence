<s> recently my computer has been crashing for no apparent reason </s>
<s> i originally thought that the processor was overheating so i vacuumed out the cooling fan on the cpu </s>
<s> i also vacuumed the power supply box </s>
<s> i ve reformatted the hard drive and reloaded windows xp sp2 </s>
<s> i also replaced the network card after the crashes started </s>
<s> it worked fine for about 4 days and then started crashing again </s>
<s> i have 1ghz of memory and a 1 86ghz processor </s>
<s> a local computer store ran some utility programs on it </s>
<s> they didnt find any problems </s>
<s> im stumped at this point </s>
<s> it usually happens after a lot of applications have been used </s>
<s> i would appreciate any suggestions that you may have </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> is this one of those old socket a systems </s>
<s> as they age you might find some bad caps see google com and the fix is to replace the boards with the bad caps </s>
<s> i can assure you the reason for the crash is not revealed in your post </s>
<s> the clues are not there </s>
<s> keep telling more and try to tell about your pc since you may not have 1 ghz of memory </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> i meant gigabyte of memory </s>
<s> i hadn t thought about a bad cap on the motherboard </s>
<s> i need to research it further </s>
<s> thanks </s>
