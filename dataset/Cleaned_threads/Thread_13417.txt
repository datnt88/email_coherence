<s> hi what would be a good spec for downloading music and using the internet a lot but not playing games </s>
<s> anything that is internet capable is the short answer </s>
<s> there are not that many web sites available for downloading legal copies of music tracks i can think of two spotify and itunes to begin with and we can t discuss any illegal options </s>
<s> but that makes no difference to what you use </s>
<s> tablet notebook laptop desktop mac windows linux ipad even iphone and other smart phones will do it </s>
<s> with such broad requirements your options are huge </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> i would like something reliable and that lasts preferrably longer than 3 years </s>
<s> my first pc from evesham lasted 5 6 years but the one i bought from novatech only lasted 3 yrs when i paid about 163 500 for it </s>
<s> i want something more reliable than that and prefer to spend a little more to get something that works well </s>
<s> i would like the internet to run reasonbly fast aswell i don t like waiting </s>
<s> i guess my budget is around 163 400 </s>
<s> the novatech one actually lasted 4 years </s>
<s> id like something that will last 4 years without becoming slow in the last year </s>
<s> also where is the edit button </s>
<s> it always runs at the same speed as new </s>
<s> compared to new machines it would seem slow </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok thnx </s>
<s> is there any websites you would recommend for buying computers already built </s>
<s> if you look at the top 100 at you notice a lack of any desktop pc making the list </s>
<s> folk are not buying many today </s>
<s> why not a laptop </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> yes there are plenty of desktops out there </s>
<s> i can t pick one for you from the some thousand models but almost any should be fine given no gaming etc </s>
<s> are these good </s>
<s> which is best </s>
<s> i don t need a laptop i have one from work and they overheat and are more expensive </s>
<s> i want something reliable and fast as im impatient and short of time i dont wanna wait 5 mins for a website to load </s>
<s> is zoostorm better than hp </s>
<s> is amd as good as intel </s>
<s> will all these have slots for putting in another internal harddrive to get my data off it </s>
<s> i can t predict which will be trouble free for years but here i d get the intel cpu units first on my list </s>
<s> why is simply because at the office and home we use visual studio a lot and it may upset amd fans that we had better performance on those </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> they are coming out of the silly ward to give you thumbs down </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> quot military intel quot </s>
<s> are graphics cards used for anything other than games </s>
<s> i mean if i go for the one with the lower end graphics card is it going to affect anything like movies internet ect </s>
<s> appreciate the help </s>
<s> oh also each post window seems to get smaller and smaller if a thread gets enough replys do the last posts in the thread become unreadable </s>
<s> but for now the current non dedicated ram gpu systems often called onboard graphics play hd fine </s>
<s> and so far i see no change in internet speed </s>
<s> as to forum oddities yes they are there </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> iv decided to get a laptop instead but not sure which one yet </s>
<s> i note the laptop pickers but look again at maybe the first or second laptop isn t a bad idea or starting point </s>
