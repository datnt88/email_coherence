<s> our pc hp a1330n pavilion stops making noise monitor goes dark sleep but on off button stays lit </s>
<s> nothing we do will bring it back and we can not turn off from switch button it must be unplugged from power supply and re plugged in </s>
<s> we have our hp plugged into an apc power back up monitor both systems are around 3yrs old </s>
<s> a few months ago i remember a message coming up saying the battery in the apc unit was old and should be replace which was never done </s>
<s> any thoughts or solutions to this problem will be appreciated </s>
<s> hyghwayman </s>
<s> and you tried another power source aside from plugging it in to apc </s>
<s> hi hyghwayman i work for hp and saw your message and want to help if i can </s>
<s> tip one thing you can do to shutdown your pc without unplugging it is to press and hold down the power button for 5 seconds </s>
<s> i m trying to better understand your problem </s>
<s> did this just start happening </s>
<s> did it occur after installing any hardware or software even a windows update </s>
<s> you might want to try updating your bios this hp support document looks like it may help it could also be that your pc is overheating </s>
<s> perhaps it needs to be cleaned </s>
<s> i hope this helps </s>
<s> let us know how it goes </s>
<s> although i am an hp employee i am speaking for myself and not for hp </s>
<s> my desktop did the same thing </s>
<s> turned out to be the power supply </s>
<s> 35 and a minute or so to fix </s>
