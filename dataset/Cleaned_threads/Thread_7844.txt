<s> how can i connect my wd hard disc to access this over my home wifi network </s>
<s> the wifi is airport extreme </s>
<s> i m left to guess you are asking folk to duplicate the apple support on this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s not completely clear to me what you mean </s>
<s> assuming you have a bare hard drive not installed in anything you can buy an enclosure for it for about 20 and connect to your computer via a usb cable </s>
<s> but then i don t know why wifi would be a factor </s>
<s> if you re talking about connecting a pc to a network via wifi you can buy a usb adapter that does that nicely for as little as 10 </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> the hard disc is connected via usb to airport extreme but can not see it on my pc </s>
<s> despite trying not successful so far </s>
<s> when the disc is connected to laptop via usb cable then it is ok but if possible i would like this disc to be available to my laptop using my home wifi </s>
<s> you mentioned airport extreme in conjunction with wifi so it sounded like this was a wireless router </s>
<s> i don t know how you could expect to connect a hard drive to that i don t believe that s possible </s>
<s> is this airport extreme some kind of server </s>
<s> please elaborate </s>
<s> quot windows users a simple to use airport disk utility provides a variety of setup options including setting the disk to become available whenever you connect to the network quot </s>
