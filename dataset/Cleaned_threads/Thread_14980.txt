<s> a few months ago my father passed away and soon thereafter my brother had two new computers installed in our father s home both new units were dells purchased from dell s small business division </s>
<s> one computer is a low end dell dimension desktop the other computer is a dell inspiron 1300 notebook which i have enjoyed using very much </s>
<s> my brother also had my old dial up service with bell south switched over to their company s entry level dsl service </s>
<s> a lynksys router was also installed in the bedroom with the dell desktop which allows me to use the notebook wirelessly throughout the house </s>
<s> i have yet to use the dell desktop and am reluctant to do so since i don t want to load that computer down with my personal data </s>
<s> for quite sometime now i ve wanted to purchase a desktop pc from velocity micro but have come to the conclusion that their systems are too expensive for my personal budget </s>
<s> dell takes a real bashing in many forums including forums here on cnet and i m reluctant to purchase a desktop pc from dell for myself for that very reason poor customer service and tech support </s>
<s> the dell s in the house belong to my brother and if something happens to them they ll be his problem not mine </s>
<s> if i did consider purchasing a new desktop pc from dell should i consider purchasing one of their low end xps models and purchase it through their small business division rather than their home office division </s>
<s> are dell xps machines built with better parts than lower end dell dimension desktop pc models </s>
<s> i read somewhere can t remember where that i would receive usa based tech support if i purchased a new pc from dell s small business division but i would receive overseas tech support if i purchased a new desktop pc from dell s home office division </s>
<s> i was considering something like a dell xps 400 or similar unit from dell s small business division </s>
<s> if i should not consider purchasing a new desktop pc from dell i ve already ruled out velocity micro due to their cost which other brands of desktop pc s should i consider to purchase for someone who would use a new desktop pc simply for word processing personal finance web surfing and email </s>
<s> something with an 80 to 120gb hd 512mb ram dvd rom and a cdrw either a dedicated video card or equipped with integrated video and audio 56k modem and the ability to access high speed internet </s>
<s> a built in floppy drive outdated now but would still be nice connections up front for a digital camera if i decide to purchase one in the future would also be a nice </s>
<s> are desktop pc s by acer any good </s>
<s> since having the experience of using a notebook computer for the first time i ll have to say that i m hooked </s>
<s> to be able to sit in the living room and surf the net or send emails from there is rather nice </s>
<s> i d like to one day buy myself a notebook of my own like dell s e1505 or equivalent from dell s small business division since i ve read many good reviews as well as user feedback comments about it but until then i ll continue to use my brother s new dell inspiron 1300 in the meantime i really do need to buy myself a new desktop pc to replace my old win 95 desktop pc </s>
<s> should i consider buying from dell or from somebody else </s>
<s> big steve 06 25 06 </s>
<s> there are also good hp deals </s>
<s> i ve had good experience with emachines and hp </s>
<s> but gateway owns emachines so its probably good too </s>
<s> you could always build your own computer </s>
<s> other brands to consider include monarch overdrive hypersonic voodoo falcon northwest and alienware but all of these are expensive </s>
<s> some cheaper manufacturers with some positive and many negative reviews include cyberpower ibuypower and elite </s>
<s> there are also many smallers brands which i would not advocate buying from </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> roger so you would recommend those brands listed in your post over dell </s>
<s> big steve 06 25 06 </s>
<s> just got done posting in there and then saw yours </s>
<s> but just let me add this all brands have good and bad and most will argue until the sun burns out about which is better </s>
<s> if emachines has fixed their little power supply issue they had a few years to a couple of years ago then they are very good running and for a good price </s>
<s> but even so don t take my word read others as well and do what you feel is the best solution for you </s>
<s> also go to the sites and read user reiveiws on computers or non bias testers that actually put these computers through the ringer </s>
