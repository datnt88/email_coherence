<s> computer dell has been working fine then yesterday i went to watch a video and it played fine but no voice </s>
<s> so i checked to see if the volume might have gotten on mute but it was on it s regular setting </s>
<s> the icon is no longer in the tray as it usually is </s>
<s> then check sounds devices and everything is grayed out staying no audio device can be found </s>
<s> i checked everything else and update all the drivers but still no sound </s>
<s> how could it suddenly disappear </s>
<s> any help as always is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> so i m going with generic advice </s>
<s> 1 use system restore to the day before yesterday </s>
<s> 2 never accept drivers from microsoft unless you are ready to deal with the failures </s>
<s> 3 look in the bios settings for the enable disable of on board sound </s>
<s> a few reply they didn t change it which is nice to know but still something we must check </s>
<s> sorry for the generic answers but no model number to work with </s>
<s> and don t panic if the audio card is gone and failed </s>
<s> there are 2 dollar usb sound devices to take over for a cheap fix </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> now that is crazy </s>
<s> i haven t had to do restore for a very long time </s>
<s> went to system restore and to click on a restore date </s>
<s> there are no dates showing </s>
<s> the quot calendar quot is blank </s>
<s> as for the drivers i only checked to see if they were all up to date and they were </s>
<s> what would cause this issue with system restore </s>
<s> going to check the bios settings now </s>
<s> nice when it works but it fails for far too many reasons for me to list here </s>
<s> no model number no os listed so we are still in generic answers </s>
<s> oh here s the 2 buck audio fix i use too often gt that s 1 46 today to my mail box </s>
<s> i carry one with me if i m out to troubleshoot fix an audio issue like the one above </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> dell inspiron and windows xp </s>
<s> sounds like a easy fix if all else fails will order one today </s>
<s> i see you see why i carry one in my bag of tricks </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> once again you ve help solve a issue without a great deal of cost </s>
<s> thanks raven </s>
<s> but it s not a done deal yet </s>
<s> it is something i ve used a few times and sometimes i don t even have to install a driver for that thing </s>
<s> try it without the driver and hope </s>
<s> gt about system restore </s>
<s> if it s empty try the old windows thing </s>
<s> disable sr and then re enable sr bob </s>
<s> i tried what you suggested and that still didn t fix the issue </s>
<s> so i ran disk cleanup and sr now show the calendar but now it won t allow me to chose a date </s>
<s> my only option is restore today </s>
<s> i went into device manager and there is a yellow question mark beside multimedia audio controller </s>
<s> i did right click on it disabled and enabled and check properties </s>
<s> it appears their is no audio controller or driver i m not sure which of those is the issue and how to fix it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> just remove the sound controller </s>
<s> windows should try to reinstall it </s>
<s> another way to approach this is to see if you have a disk that came with the computer with a chipset driver </s>
<s> a chipset driver is software that tells windows what hardware you have on your computer s motherboard so it will know what it is and how to use it </s>
<s> usually this comes with a motherboard or a computer when you purchase it </s>
<s> if you take your model number of your computer you should be able to go to dell s website and download it or an updated version </s>
<s> look for the support section at dell s website </s>
<s> sometimes drivers become corrupt </s>
<s> this can happen if the power supply is going bad or the hard drive is failing and you get file damage </s>
<s> if the computer is really old things may be waring out </s>
<s> hard drives fail and this may be a sign of a failing hard drive </s>
<s> of course your audio devide could be bad also </s>
<s> only if there are restore points after the repairs you did </s>
<s> there are many issues with system restore and the lack of any backup or restore of this feature is one of them </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i right clicked on multimedia audio controller and properities </s>
<s> it states there is no driver </s>
<s> i searched around and the driver they are suggesting is realtek 97 and it keeps crashing my pc midway through the install causing the blue screen of death </s>
<s> after i two attempts at installing it i gave it </s>
<s> i also went in services windows audio and clicked on restart and nothing </s>
<s> still no audio </s>
<s> i shut down and rebooted and still no sound </s>
<s> i just keeps stating there is no driver for multimedia audio controller </s>
<s> i downloaded the suggested one from here but for some reason it won t allow me to run it </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> and dozens of drivers for each one </s>
<s> so it is almost a sure thing you can t get the right one </s>
<s> gt gt gt gt gt i can t find the model number of this dell </s>
<s> then means i have to go with generic advice along with the usual head to dell com put in the service tag from the machine for the drivers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry i thought i had posted that info </s>
<s> i also was wrong on what dell it is </s>
<s> it s actually dimesion 4550 not a inspiron that is my laptop </s>
<s> not sure if it s any help as i didn t post it but the audio device is unimodem half duplex audio device </s>
<s> i ll give dell a try and post whatever results i get </s>
<s> reply to the top post to carry on </s>
