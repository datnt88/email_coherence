<s> hi this is my second post regarding the same problem </s>
<s> win 98 celeron 170 256 ram hp 610 c printer ink refill used </s>
<s> c d e drive </s>
<s> window reinstalled after c is formatted just a few days ago </s>
<s> d e were untouched </s>
<s> my printer works fine on other pc s and print all kind of files </s>
<s> on my pc it print only text files </s>
<s> no problem in text files </s>
<s> but don t print word doc web pages </s>
<s> even don t print text page as of gt from printer services </s>
<s> when it start printing them gt it starts and than inside the printing thing hit on sides too bit harder and than i get unable to communicate with printer port lpt1 message </s>
<s> than i get alternate flashing lights in printer </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> thanks aron </s>
<s> you may also find it annoying that a perfectly good parallel printer cable may need replacing with some ieee cable or the bios set to epp or standard before this will work </s>
<s> in short my question is whether you installed all those lovely drivers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you need to do a complete de install and remove all references to that printer </s>
<s> then physically disconnect ptr </s>
<s> and then reboot and allow it to finish </s>
<s> once done to a shutdown </s>
<s> upon next reboot or power up follow whatever instructions they re for the install you may need to connect ptr </s>
<s> now or later just follow the instructions </s>
<s> don t take anything for granted if you haven t already get another lpt cable or swap port s if multiple ones </s>
<s> if none of this fixes the problem reload windows over itself it won t change any setting but may reload os pgms </s>
<s> required </s>
<s> make sure to reload the system or mtrbd </s>
<s> drivers from restore cd or driver cd after the os reload </s>
<s> you haven t already visit the hp support website for clues hints tips on the topic </s>
<s> they do supply some info its worth the visit plus check for any newer drivers </s>
<s> fyi refilled ink carts can cause problems that are weird to understand </s>
<s> take into account a refilled ink cart can be done so many times before it has to be pitched usually i consider 5 6 refills tops then toss out </s>
