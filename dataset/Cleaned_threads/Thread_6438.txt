<s> hi i m looking to build a new pc for entertainment media purposes especially gaming </s>
<s> i ve pretty much specced my pc but i m currently looking into speakers i don t like to use headphones </s>
<s> anyone have any suggestions as to which i should purchase </s>
<s> i have had great experiences with both but i have not had good experiences with bose </s>
<s> just my 2 cents </s>
<s> totally agree with james logitech makes some really good stuff for computers creative as well </s>
<s> i use a logitech system and am well pleased plus they don t cost you an arm and a leg </s>
<s> their other peripherals are also excellent keyboards and mice joysticks etc </s>
<s> all of my peripherals on all systems are logitech </s>
<s> try out the new ambx stuff from phillips speakers included </s>
<s> should add something new to your gaming rig </s>
<s> logitech and creative do some good stuff but not quite like this </s>
