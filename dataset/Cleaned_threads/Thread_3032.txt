<s> i have a router and two pcs on it </s>
<s> one ethernet connected to the router has a printer and i want to share it with the other pc </s>
<s> i set up the printer as shared then i went to the other pc wireless connection to the router and tried to define a remote printer </s>
<s> the printer add wizard cannot find the printer i tried browsing and it found nothing i tried telling it the printer was pcname printername and it couldn t find it either what am i missing </s>
<s> both machines are running winxp home john </s>
<s> when browsing for it try typing the following into explorer ip address of pc with printer share printer share name ie 192 168 1 50 hplsjet if it finds it click on it and connect </s>
<s> browse the network for the pc that hosts the printer </s>
<s> click on it and see if the printer shows </s>
<s> it should if the sharing was set up properly </s>
<s> do a right click and select quot connect quot </s>
<s> i remember years ago older nt systems had an quot install quot option from this point but not sure if this works the same </s>
<s> the ideal way is to use a print server but this costs a bit and not all printers and print servers work happily together </s>
<s> i once had a similar problem </s>
<s> the issue was not with the physical set up but with the firewall software e g norton security black ice etc </s>
<s> i had installed on the machines </s>
<s> if you re running one of these programs you should go into the scren that allows you to allow or add quot friendly quot ip addresses </s>
<s> just type in the ip address of your printer e g 192 168 1 100 and hopefully you ll set up program will now be able to quot see quot the networked printer </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> the_ehrl makes a very good point </s>
<s> i don t know how many network problems i ve pulled hair out trying to solve only to track it back to a simple firewall block </s>
<s> enough at least that now the firewall is the frist place i look when a network problem rears it s ugly head </s>
