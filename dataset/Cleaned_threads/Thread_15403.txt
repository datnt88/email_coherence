<s> i don t know which os you have but your query isn t going to be done if at all </s>

<s> don t fall for any s w that claims this i really can t recommend anything such as you want </s>
<s> you could however make or create recovery discs if you have vista or win7 the process is present to do this </s>
<s> if you have xp this is more complicated and generally i wouldn t say it really does it from ms sources </s>
<s> any windoze os can be safely back up or generate an image in order to make a back up which would be a restore recovery of current setup </s>
<s> google for back up process and s w that provides this </s>
<s> however you can buy or replace your os if you have oem or diy type system </s>
<s> an oem is any system build by the likes of dell gateway etc contact them as possible source or restore recovery discs for some cost </s>
<s> there are s w services which provide replacement discs for oem type pcs </s>
<s> you can of course buy original or full retail type os from online trusted vendors or use ebay craigslist or local shops </s>
