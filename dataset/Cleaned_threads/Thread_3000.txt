<s> i bought a new cheap x link internal 56k modem </s>
<s> i put it in the pci slot i adjusted the volume to the max then dialed </s>
<s> but whalla no sound </s>
<s> i figured out that the new modem has no speaker compare to my old one </s>
<s> i just want to know if there are any way to hear the sound of dialing by using my own pc speaker since the modem don t have speaker so i think using the pc speaker is possible </s>
<s> if it s possible kindly tell me how to do it </s>
<s> i know this is possible because there are some computers that i know that when it dials the sound comes through the pc speaker itself </s>
<s> it s also possible to cut costs there is no speaker </s>
<s> since there are some zillion modems out there unless i could see the modem or a web site with details about the modem there is no hope to connect some sound from the modem to your sound card with some cable </s>

<s> i think you answered you re own question quot a new cheap x link internal 56k modem quot </s>
<s> if it has no speaker then the drivers or the vendors s w has to route any sound output to the system </s>
<s> the at cmds </s>
<s> apply to the physical modem and usually not to the system </s>
<s> you need to find some s w from some 3rd party i don t know of any if any as an solution </s>
<s> but since this is new return to the vendor and get a different one w speaker </s>
<s> if you haven t already check the x link support website for hints tips in that regard </s>
<s> to be honest i never heard of x link brand but then many a vendor comes along quot rebranding quot a popular chipset and sell as thier own </s>
<s> that maybe a hint in following the chipset and see if a cure if available </s>
