<s> my system has killed two power supply units in about a year and a half </s>
<s> this last one was a 800w </s>
<s> i am only running a dual core amd </s>
<s> i am running a higher end video card but nothing 800w wouldnt be able to handle </s>
<s> i think the other one was a 500w </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> are you using a good ups or surge suppessor </s>
<s> yeah i have it in a surge protector </s>
<s> it s next to impossible for a pc that s functioning normally to quot kill quot a power supply every few months </s>
<s> an electrical problem in the pc would cause it to perform erractically if at all </s>
<s> however bad ac power can cause a power supply to fail and a cheap surge suppressor won t clean up bad power </s>
<s> having 2 bad psus isn t the end of the world but can suggest the quot outside world quot can be having an effect </s>
<s> meaning that bad power ac as ramac mentioned could be at fault </s>
<s> a simple surge protector is not meant to last forever </s>
<s> in fact if the surge protector got hit its good just for quot 1 time quot for its rating </s>
<s> it may still allow ac to flow but the protection is gone </s>
<s> better surge protectors offer a led showing being active and not just ac present </s>
<s> further considering your hi wattage 800w psu that got pasted a decent ups is probably needed as well </s>
<s> if possible a good quot ac line conditioner quot too as even more protection </s>
<s> while psu rating are a good starting point to check the specs a true decent psu provides also its rms value or true level basic of proper stable wattage output usually lower than the rating </s>
<s> many times the rating offered is quot peak quot and a psu shouldn t be operating at peak for long periods again being stressed </s>
<s> taking nothing for granted good cooling is very much desired </s>
<s> have ample cooling to the system case so its doesn t set up the psu to fail </s>
<s> lacking cooling and improper venting will cause a psu to stress out and fail quicker </s>
<s> last psu specs should offer the quot rail voltages amps quot as any voltage once comprised will bring down the psu </s>
<s> thus dual rails offer to spread the voltage demands to other components so no lone component s is having to do all the work </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
