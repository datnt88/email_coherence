<s> can anyone provide some information on wireless cable modems </s>
<s> do they eliminate the need for a wireless router between the modem and the computer </s>
<s> any recommendations on a model </s>
<s> i ve seen different reports on motorola s sbg900 and sbg1000 </s>
<s> i need to hook up my existing modem via usb rather than ethernet </s>
<s> is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router </s>
<s> thanks steve rehmann </s>
<s> is a usb connected modem then you may want to change to the combo if it offers an ethernet interface rather then trying to add a stand only router </s>
<s> the built in router if a quot g quot type will run at close to 54mbps </s>
<s> add a wireless quot b quot device and the speeds drop to 11mbps </s>
<s> not having to run cat5 cable is the main advantage in going 802 11x </s>
<s> quot is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router quot i would think not </s>
<s> michael thanks for the response </s>
<s> let me see if i follow </s>
<s> i am stuck with the usb connection to my desktop </s>
<s> i had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working </s>
<s> my isp mediacom and i troubleshot </s>
<s> we ended up trying different ethernet cards different cables different modems and different pci slots to no avail </s>
<s> when we switched to the usb it connected right away </s>
<s> i am not disapointed with the speed or performance </s>
<s> i would guess there is a setting or failure of some type at the computer as i can get the signal to the modem but not to the computer on the ethernet side </s>
<s> are you saying that a wireless cable modem quot combo quot would be a route to go if it has an ethernet side for a laptop </s>
<s> i am looking at a motorola sbg900 wireless modem </s>
<s> it says it has a 802 11g wireless access point </s>
<s> my thoughts were that i could keep the desktop cabled to the modem as it has a usb connection on the rear </s>
<s> i thought that would eliminate the need for a wireless usb adaptor between the desktop and modem </s>
<s> i would then add the notebook as a wireless connection to the ethernet side of the modem </s>
<s> i d end up with a physical cable connection from the modem to the desktop usb and a wireless connection from the laptop to the modem ethernet </s>
<s> am i on the right track </s>
<s> steve rehmann </s>
<s> would work with your laptop if your laptop has a wireless adapter instead of a physical cable ethernet connection </s>
<s> the troublesome statement is quot i had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working </s>
<s> my isp mediacom and i troubleshot </s>
<s> we ended up trying different ethernet cards different cables different modems and different pci slots to no avail </s>
<s> when we switched to the usb it connected right away quot this indicates a problem within either the computers networking hardware software or the modem </s>
<s> the prevalent cause of lost connections is some type of viral spyware malware infection which if not cleaned off will eventually come back to haunt you </s>
<s> michael i regularly run ad aware and spybot and often have very few items to remove </s>
<s> will also use registry mechanic to clean registry </s>
<s> i am running xp sp2 512 ram amd athlon xp 1 47g </s>
<s> harware includes a motorola sb4200 modem logitech wireless mouse and keyboard xtasy 9200se 128mb video card audixy sx usb sound card creative tv card and a pinnicle video capture card </s>
<s> i have 5 usb ports in the rear and all are full </s>
<s> 2 up front are used infrequently </s>
<s> 2 firewire ports are on the same pci card that has the 3 usb ports </s>
<s> ehternet card is a d link dfe 530tx so what we are running into is even though there is something wrong with the ethernet connection on the desktop i would be able to keep the wired usb connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> quot i would be able to keep the wired usb connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem </s>
<s> quot you should be good to go except for the statement that the wireless laptop will connect via ethernet </s>
<s> the ethernet standard 802 3 is primarily used with cat5 cabling while a wireless connection 802 11 is just that </s>
<s> ps try following the advice laid out here for a more precise scan </s>
<s> thanks mike </s>
<s> i thing i m getting the hang of it </s>
<s> you ve been very helpful </s>
