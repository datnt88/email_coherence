<s> i moved one of two computers to another room not wired for computer internet </s>
<s> i purchased and installed a netgear wireless router </s>
<s> i connected my dsl modem via connector cable to the netgear wireless router </s>
<s> one hardwire connection was made to a regularly used computer nearest the router </s>
<s> my remote computer has a mating netgear pc wireless card attached and everything works with one exception </s>
<s> that exception is that the hardwired computer nearest the wireless router for some reason needs to be on and online in order for the remote computer to actually have an internet connection </s>
<s> my question is quot if i connect the dsl modem to a hardwired router with one connection for my computer and then one connection to the wireless router would the remote computer have internet access without having a host computer power on and online quot my intention was to have the remote computer have the capability of achieving a real wireless connection to the internet without any other computer running </s>
<s> any suggestions would be appreciated </s>
<s> sorry but what you said was very confusing to me </s>
<s> here is what should happen </s>
<s> you need 1 your two computers each with some kind of network card your first with a wired and the second with the wireless 2 one dsl modem 3 one wireless router with an internal switch </s>
<s> i believe you have both 2 and 3 although it would help if you included more info as to the model numbers sounds to me like you might have the remote computer somehow getting its internet connection through a quot host quot your wired computer </s>
<s> this is not what you need </s>
<s> when setting up the network make sure you have it gaining access to the internet through a quot residential gateway quot your router </s>
<s> run the wizards and configuration cds included with your router and cards </s>
<s> this should help </s>
<s> if you include more info about os models etc </s>
<s> we can help you a little more </s>
