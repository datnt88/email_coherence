<s> i broke my usb belkin n adapter metal cap went off after i stomp on it accidental it fell off of my desk and it may broke the chip i heard i have the warranties since i brought this early 08 or 09 forgot and broke it few day ago </s>
<s> will belken willing to replace it or am i sol and have to buy a new one </s>
<s> i don t know if they willing to replace it or not since i cant find the warranties information on their site or how much it will cost </s>
<s> if anyone know or have inside info with belkin please post the information </s>
<s> i email tech support for information and getting it next week for more information since they dont work on weekend </s>
<s> now a day i think it s cheaper to just buy another one </s>
<s> but i hope you get a free replacement from them </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> products that become defective during a specific period of time but unless accidents are specified as being covered i suspect you re out of luck </s>
<s> my guess is that physical damage is considered as abuse or misuse and won t fall under warranty coverage </s>
