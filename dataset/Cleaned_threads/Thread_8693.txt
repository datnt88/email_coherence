<s> for some reason my wireless receiver decided to stop working this morning </s>
<s> it s not a battery problem otherwise the receiver would still light up </s>
<s> i still get power to the receiver since i can still charge my mouse and i sincerely doubt my usb ports died during the night </s>
<s> i can t get by the bios since it doesn t detect a keyboard </s>
<s> any advice </s>
<s> it s a shame when expensive stuff doesn t work </s>
<s> my wireless pair required me to push some recessed buttons for them to pair up </s>
<s> i don t know if the logitech has a similar feature </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> dear zeke i have this also </s>
<s> mine have not stopped working quot on their own quot aside from batteries in both the keyboard and the mouse </s>
<s> suggest you change the batteries in both pieces first </s>
<s> there might be enough quot juice quot left to light up an indicator light but not enough to run the equipment itself </s>
<s> bob is right that there is a reset quot connect quot button on the receiver which sits on your desk not forgetting the one on the underside of the keyboard </s>
<s> remember also that there is supposed be about 8 quot or whatever of clear space around the receiver so that it can pick up the signal </s>
<s> have you downloaded a logitech upgrade for these </s>
<s> i have problems with these and tend to restore back to the earlier software version </s>
<s> also i think logitech uses some shared files with other apps dll s i think but it s a while ago that i came across this </s>
<s> is it possible you have deleted software files or removed programs which might have taken away this sharing capability </s>
<s> might be necessary to reinstall from logitech disc if so and then re upgrade if these work for you </s>
<s> regards mo </s>
<s> you could connect this and if it works you have isolated the problem to the keyboard or mouse as the case may be </s>
<s> regards mo </s>
<s> i have installed a lot of these had a high rate of failure one client had the keyboard and mouse both die twice in a year and were replaced under warranty the third time they were out of warranty and they just went back to wired devices </s>
<s> in other cases they claimed the batteries were pretty new but it didn t work changing the batteries again resolved it </s>
<s> as the other message mentions hitting connect buttons on keyboard and mouse can usually fix this but not in many cases i have seen </s>
