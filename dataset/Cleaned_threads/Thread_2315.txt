<s> i am trying to decide on a desktop </s>
<s> before even picking out the model i was wondering what your rankings of the companies are </s>
<s> by choosing a company i can go from there and buy a specific type </s>
<s> please anyone make a top list of the best companies out there </s>
<s> in your personal opinion of course thanks j </s>
<s> ibm oops no more then dell hp etc </s>
<s> the big problem is that while most makers have fine hardware you might be installing windows and have issues with windows or other software issue </s>
<s> this is where it all breaks down and you find little support </s>
<s> if you look at apple you find a lot less in the virus trojan etc so that issue is not a big deal </s>
<s> support is better since you deal with just one company for the os and hardware </s>
<s> and you pay for what you get bob </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> may i ask why </s>
<s> my six have performed flawlessly </s>
<s> and they ve all been refurbed from ibm </s>
<s> thankfully they had a great start in life with great products </s>
<s> let s hope it continues on </s>
<s> but they still fail in meeting owner s support needs windows </s>
<s> bob </s>
