<s> i am looking for an 8 bay external box for my pc </s>
<s> i run vista 64 bit on my desktop and vista 32 bit on my laptop </s>
<s> i would like for it to work on either pc </s>
<s> i would prefer a box that will accept 8 drives up to 2tb each minimum of 1 5tb each </s>
<s> reasonable pricing would be a benefit </s>
<s> wireless connection is not required </s>
<s> please leave me some suggestions </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> please read it carefully and read the link about the mystery of the missing partitions </s>
<s> i am seeing this happen more often as people move more and more to vista </s>
<s> they copy stuff to some usb or other connected drive and plug it into their other vista machine and then the room temp feels like it plunged 50 degrees as they can t find their precious files </s>
<s> a lot of this issue is mitigated if you put these on a nas and never connect directly with usb firewire or sata </s>
<s> at least you ve been warned about the issue and will keep your backups current </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> i m open to any suggestions </s>
<s> i ll look into a nas drive as well </s>
<s> i ve looked in the past and read some really bad reviews </s>
<s> after reading what you sent me i ll look back into it </s>
