<s> i bought a wireless card a few weeks ago linksys wireless g pci card wmp54gs and it worked perfectly right out of the box </s>
<s> i have two networks that i connect to </s>
<s> one is wired and the other wireless </s>
<s> i would just disable the one i wasn t using and enable the other </s>
<s> for some reason though this morning when i tried to enable the wireless network connection the computer froze windows xp pro sp2 </s>
<s> i restarted and the same thing happened </s>
<s> i tried reseating the card and installing the latest drivers </s>
<s> windows detects the new hardware but then i get an error that says the device was unable to start code 10 </s>
<s> the linksys tech support reps weren t very helpful </s>
<s> the only suggestion they had was that there was an irq conflict and they couldn t help me with it </s>
<s> everything else on the computer is working fine </s>
<s> i haven t made any hardware or major software changes </s>
<s> what can i do about this </s>
<s> another small thing i noticed was that when i reinstalled the drivers it labels the card as quot 2 quot this leads me to believe that it still thinks there is another card installed from my first installation </s>
<s> how do i get rid of this </s>
<s> thanks kevin </s>
<s> irq conflicts are technically impossible in pci systems </s>
<s> your post didn t get much indication of the host machine so any input i can give is going to be generic </s>
<s> gt use system restore to when it worked </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i would start by removing the linksys card from the device manager in start gt control panel gt administrative tools gt computer management gt device manager gt network adapters </s>
<s> remove both instances of the card in this area </s>
<s> reboot your computer next and let the operating system detect and set up the card </s>
<s> my bet is that this will resolve your conflict </s>
<s> right click my computer gt properties gt click devices gt click device manager </s>
<s> open the network cards icon green you ll see a red x on both your wireless cards click on each one and delete them one at a time except your lan card just delete the wireless cards </s>
<s> now restart the computer and windows should detect and auto install the drivers if it can t find the drivers then click the cancel button and reinstall the linksys driver setup </s>
<s> once installed if you need to reboot then reboot </s>
<s> now click start gt settings </s>
<s> control panel </s>
<s> network connections </s>
<s> right click the wireless card </s>
<s> click properties </s>
<s> click the advanced tab </s>
<s> click the checkbox next to windows firewall to uncheck the box </s>
<s> this will disable the windows firewall and should allow your wireless to communicate </s>
