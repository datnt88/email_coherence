<s> i had no problems with the wd drive until this morning </s>
<s> it is connected to the computer via a usb2 cable </s>
<s> i turned on the computer </s>
<s> as the booting was taking place the wd drive powered up but then produced three clicking sounds then a pause then another set of three clicking sounds </s>
<s> then the power stayed on but it was not attached as a drive i e </s>
<s> it does not appear as a drive and i have no access to the data stored on it </s>
<s> has anyone run into this problem and what was the solution then </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> over in our storage forum the most succesful recovery is when the owner opens the usb casing and moves the drive into another case </s>
<s> however if you ve been very good about backups you can make it a warranty issue and let them have it </s>
<s> example case for ide drives at example case for sata drives at sorry no </s>
<s> i can t guess if it s the case but it s the cheap part you want to replace if you want a shot at getting to the files again </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> not that worried about the drive itself </s>
<s> i can replace that </s>
<s> i need to recover the data if in fact the symptoms are those of a crashed or crashing drive </s>
<s> unfortunately i am out of warantee as of last april </s>
<s> i am hoping that someone else had this misfortune before and can shed some light </s>
<s> i am trying to open the case and identify the source of the click </s>
<s> the click is a very bad sign </s>
<s> you must try the new case if you must save your files or put the drive into some desktop </s>
<s> the longer it is in a defective enclosure the hopes dim </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i took the drive out of the wd box and put in another enclosure with the same bad results </s>
<s> i will try tomorrow to put the drive inside the desktop second bay and hope </s>
<s> after you try that read a few and gt yes i ve done both methods as a last resort before we call up bob </s>
