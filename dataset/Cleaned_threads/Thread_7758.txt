<s> as i am sure you know part of the regular maintenance of a computer is to clean out the dust in it every so often </s>
<s> i leave my desktop computer on the floor to have more room on my desk so it accumulates lots of dust </s>
<s> i was going to use my small portable vacuum cleaner to clean my computer but was told by a friend not to use it because it may cause static or quot shoot quot something into the computer </s>
<s> when i use the small compressed air cans it often seems like they don t have sufficient power to thoroughly clean my computer </s>
<s> 1 what is the best way to clean out the dust and debris in a computer </s>
<s> 2 can i use a portable vacuum to do the job </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> richard </s>
<s> i don t think i would ever put a vacuum into the computer maybe parts like in the front where some dust might collect i wouldn t be running it over all the parts in the computer </s>
<s> i don t know what air you are buying but all the time i have used air it is way powerful enough to lean anything i need out of the computer </s>
<s> after the can of air has been used for a while the presure does go down </s>
<s> a can of air costs like 2 00 at wal mart </s>
<s> that is what i have always used </s>
<s> a vac and a small brush for years works fine </s>
<s> don t get quot ham handed quot with the vac </s>
<s> i can clean most of the innards without touching anything with the vac just get it close </s>
<s> heatsinks fans stubborn stuff use the small brush and then bring the vac close </s>
<s> there may be no right or wrong way to do this </s>
<s> heck one forum member uses 409 and a garden hose </s>
<s> i use my campbell hausfeld 80 gallon compressor set at 80 pounds </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> i take the case into the garage and blow it out </s>
<s> using a vacuum can cause a problem </s>
<s> air moving through the plastic hose generates static electricity </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> using plastic brushes will conduct static electricity </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> static electricity and ics don t mix </s>
<s> before you have a stroke remember this </s>
<s> anything in the pc that can be damaged by compressed air doesn t belong there </s>
<s> wayne there are 10 types of people who understand binary those that do and those that don t </s>
<s> click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about analog and digital data internet connections spyware removal and download free software </s>
<s> i suggest anyone using compressed canned air in any form beware of not blowing too hard spinning any fans </s>
<s> the quot geewiz quot factor of blowing a fan into untold rpms isn t good and can easily damage them </s>
<s> further any jumpers need be noted in case they are blown out off </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
