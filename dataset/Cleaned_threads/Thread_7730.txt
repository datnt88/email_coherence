<s> i want to get a not too expensive scanner for scanning in b w negatives i m taking for school and probably color negatives in the future but also for general scanning in documents etc </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i know i once saw a scanner that was a regular scanner but then had a frame that you put negatives in and put that on the scanner bed and it would automatically crop and resize all the negatives is this a common feature or only available in higher price scanners </s>
<s> i m using windows xp sp2 </s>
<s> i had to find it for you </s>
<s> look here and you ll be able to figure out after research what you need to do this </s>
<s> best i could do </s>
