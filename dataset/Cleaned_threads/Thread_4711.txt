<s> how much confidence do you have in your surge protector to protect your electronics </s>
<s> i m very confident </s>
<s> what kind do you have </s>
<s> somewhat confident </s>
<s> why the so so answer </s>
<s> no confidence whatsoever </s>
<s> why not </s>
<s> i only use the surge protector to give me more outlets </s>
<s> not confident at after reading this topic </s>
<s> please explain </s>
<s> i don t use surge protectors </s>
<s> why not </s>
<s> 25 years ago i worked in a small computer store while back in school as a non traditional student </s>
<s> we sold some what then seemed rather expensive surge protectors </s>
<s> the proof to me that they were worth the money was when one customers home was hit by lightening </s>
<s> the only thing damaged in their computer was the modem the surege managed to come in through the phone line </s>
<s> they lost all the tvs their microwave their fridge and freezer plus a few radios to the hit but like i said the modem was the only part of their computer that received any damage </s>
<s> one of the radios that died was in the other half the same duplex wall plug the surge protector was plugged into </s>
<s> everyone s been saying power surge but surge protectors actually protect against voltage spikes </s>
<s> a thousand volts without much amperage won t burn up much but the voltage itself can punch through the insulation of the power supply transformer windings or get through to the electronics </s>
<s> i usually use a middle of the road in terms of cost surge protector but as the survey asked i m one of those who uses a surge protector for the extra outlets note that there is a difference between a power strip and a real surge protector </s>
<s> for protection all sensitive equipment here has a ups </s>
<s> i might take more precautions if i lived in an area that had a lot of lightning strikes like florida </s>
<s> but like lee i live in an area southern california that only has lightning once or twice per year </s>
<s> so let s see i have three upses and a bunch of surge protectors for the outlets </s>
<s> but you know what </s>
<s> if there is some kind of storm we shut off power to the computers and or pull the power cord out and maybe even shut off the upses altogether </s>
<s> the downside ups systems cost a lot of money and you frequently every three years or so have to replace the batteries </s>
<s> also you will use a lot more electricity with a ups even when not using your computer </s>
<s> so what it boils down to is the universal engineering symbol quot quot </s>
<s> what is more costly running ups systems or replacing your computer </s>
<s> if you throw in the quot odds quot of having a direct power lightning hit the decision can be something you can estimate </s>
<s> assuming you have a backup how much would it cost to replace your whole computer system if it gets hit </s>
<s> how much would it cost to buy maintain and quot feed quot with electricity a ups </s>
<s> now what about surge protectors </s>
<s> first of all there is a big difference between a surge protector and a power strip power strips just add outlets and maybe an quot extension cord quot but really don t offer any protection </s>
<s> next consider how cheap quot the surge protector is </s>
<s> what is it rated at </s>
<s> most really can t handle a direct lightning strike but they can handle it if someone turns off then on your circuit breaker or there is some other abnormality on the power line </s>
<s> some companies offer a guarantee on your equipment but make sure you know what is actually covered </s>
<s> they may exclude lightning or anything over a certain size spike </s>
<s> also remember that your telephone line dsl line cable line can also be subject to a lightning strike </s>
<s> some protectors may have telephone line and network line protection </s>
<s> my suggestion is to not use any of this equipment during a storm </s>
<s> most of us can wait until later </s>
<s> also if you are in a place prone to lightning strikes move uhhh i mean get a ups </s>
<s> most all the equipment you buy today has been tested for surge protection but is integral to that system </s>
<s> surge protectors and a good grounding system that includes ground fault interupters on the distribution fuse breaker panel </s>
<s> a ups will provide good protection but the source of ground is the most important as surges will breakdown internally if a proper ground is not found </s>
<s> lightning protection will stop surges before they can get to surge protectors but need to be installed on every line that comes into the home </s>
<s> all these devices are designed to be a one shot deal once struck or surged they will destroy themsleves to provide the protection </s>
<s> my entire network and all of the equipment is behind a master ups system that i set up </s>
<s> somewhat confident </s>
<s> because a direct hit could still damage the system </s>
<s> i have a friend who works for a business program company and a few years back when the whole country was having lots of grid problems found that the spikes were taking power backup systems but those with just surge protectors were surviving </s>
<s> bottom line i believe the power backup protected by the surge protector should make the operator from knowing a surge ever happened </s>
<s> well looks good on paper </s>
<s> the most significant and beneficial thing that a surge protected can provide is the connected equipment replacement guarantee </s>
<s> i have had personal experience with this and can attest to modems and hard drives replaced at no cost and with very little hassle </s>
<s> you can receive damage from lightning in many different ways </s>
<s> the likelihood of an actual lightning strike is very narrow </s>
<s> more likely lightning will strike a power pole with a transformer on it </s>
<s> the powerline itself has some safeguards against lightning strikes </s>
<s> the mains will probably blow in such a case </s>
<s> of course if lightning strikes the house anything could happen </s>
<s> if you have an actual lightning rod that is grounded that might help divert the lightning </s>
<s> ben franklin invented the lightning rod </s>
<s> however besides the power you can get damage through cable lines and phone lines also </s>
<s> it is the networking equipment that is most likely to be damaged </s>
<s> i have seen this in my own house </s>
<s> i hope this helps someone </s>
<s> even if you disconnect the power did you disconnect the networking or is the networking power surge protected </s>
