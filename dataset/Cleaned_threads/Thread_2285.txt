<s> i just switched from 98se to xp pro and i m having trouble setting up my visioneer 7600 parallel port scanner </s>
<s> i m using paperport 8 and the software seems to work but the driver doesn t seem to work correctly </s>
<s> first i have a p4 xp pro 256mb ram and two hard drives </s>
<s> i tried the compatibility wizard and the program just crashed </s>
<s> without the compatibility mode the program works with older scans completely but when i try to scan or preview an image the program does some funny things </s>
<s> it will start the scan and never quit making multiple copies of the image and i can t close the scan window </s>
<s> is anyone running this setup </s>
<s> do i have to upgrade buy new my scanner </s>
<s> thanks in advance denny </s>
<s> visioneer does not support any of their parallel port scanners with xp period </s>
<s> i have had a few clients that were burned by this visioneer just decided it wasn t worth it </s>
<s> you need to buy a new scanner if you want to run xp </s>
<s> fortunately usb scanners are under 100 </s>
<s> parallel port devices are losing support all over </s>
<s> for much less that 100usb you find complete units like excuse the vendor link which includes updated software to use with your updated os </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> i have a few hp scanners and they seem ok </s>
<s> thanks for your advice </s>
<s> i went to sam s club and bought a onetouch 9220 visioneer and it is working wonderfully </s>
<s> i stuck with visioneer because i like the paperport 8 software </s>
<s> the scanner is 4800 x 2400 and it only cost 80 </s>
<s> it was worth the cost to get rid of the headache with the compatibility problems </s>
<s> i m almost up to par with the xp configuration and so far although a lot of work i like it better </s>
<s> thanks again denny </s>
