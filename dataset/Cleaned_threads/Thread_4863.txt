<s> while connecting an hp psc 1510 usb printer cable to the back of a pc during software installation i noticed a little quot arcing quot very small sparks between the usb port and the cable </s>
<s> can this be considered normal </s>
<s> thanks for any help rjjp </s>
<s> not good </s>
<s> there is a static buildup that needs to be drained </s>
<s> and that static will destroy chips </s>
<s> was the printer plugged into a power outlet first </s>
<s> if not always plug external powered equipment into the power outlet before connecting it to the pc </s>
<s> the ground on the power plug will drain any static charge </s>
<s> wayne give a person a fish and you feed them for a day teach that person to use the internet and they won t bother you for weeks </s>
<s> click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about telephones internet connections spyware removal and data and download free software </s>
<s> thanks for your suggestions wayne but the printer was already on when i plugged in the usb cable to the back of the pc and the power cable is earthed theoretically there should be no static so im still somewhat baffled </s>
<s> you might touch the plug to the case before plugging it into the usb port </s>
