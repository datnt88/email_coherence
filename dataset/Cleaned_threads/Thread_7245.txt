<s> hard drive only works by itself in my computer </s>
<s> if i attach another ide hdd my computer does not recognise either of them </s>
<s> this problem only happens with this hard drive </s>
<s> any solutions please </s>
<s> jumper settings on both drives you want to attach </s>
<s> the best way with newer drives is to use an 80 conductor cable and set jumpers to cs cable select </s>
<s> the 80 conductor cable has a specific way it needs to be connected to the mb </s>
<s> the important thing to note is that the blue connector goes to the motherboard </s>
<s> that you get all the cables and jumpers right </s>
<s> here s what you need to know </s>
<s> once in awhile you will find a drive that will not tolerate any second ide device </s>
<s> this may confuse the new to ide technician </s>
<s> after the initial shock and after encountering this a few more times it dawns on the tech that not all ide devices can coexist </s>
<s> yes they should but the awful truth is that a few don t </s>
<s> at least we have other solutions </s>
<s> i ll leave jumper and cable discussions out of my replies since that s been done many times and there are plenty of web pages about that </s>

<s> hi i am the same person whom you answered in the win xp forum about the sata drivers </s>
<s> both hd s are ide when i plug in my maxtor hard drive with my cd both are recognised when i plug in my western digital hard drive with my cd drive neither are recognised however this hard drive is recognised by itself when the cd drive is not connected </s>
<s> so i feel that this one hard drive western digital which is only being recognised by itself has a problem </s>
<s> any solutions please </s>
<s> i tried using jumpers </s>
<s> i only have one ide connector </s>
<s> i need to get this working so i can install windows on it </s>
<s> please assist </s>
<s> this wd faulty hd worked as a slave in my other pc before </s>
<s> today i formatted it and was going to install windows and found that when i plugged in this hd both ide connections were not being recognised </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> i noted the usual and that jumpers and cables are widely documented </s>
<s> can you be more specific </s>
<s> this wd faulty hd worked as a slave in my other pc before </s>
<s> today i formatted it and was going to install windows and found that when i plugged in this hd both ide connections were not being recognised i don t understand why it should not work now </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> parts do fail from time to time </s>
<s> folk get the jumpers wrong </s>
<s> some can t accept cable jumper or hardware faults </s>
<s> remember that i elected to not write about cables or jumpers as that s been done </s>
<s> here s one thought </s>
<s> test each drive on its own </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> as this pc works with other hard drives using the same cables i would expect it to work </s>
<s> i am quite sure that my jumpers settings are correct </s>
<s> do you need an more details </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> drives work on their own </s>
<s> no need to talk about cable and jumpers </s>
<s> i am sure they are correct </s>
<s> what would be the other cause please </s>
<s> so would y ou say that the hard drive is probably faulty </s>
<s> if the drives work one at a time but not together and you claim the cables and jumpers are fine then it s the usual problem i ve seen over the years </s>
<s> why not put these two each on their own ide channel </s>
<s> don t have another channel </s>
<s> i have other sata connectors but not another ide one </s>
<s> faulty drive works in a hard drive external enclosure </s>
<s> some techs can t wrap their head around that </s>
<s> and again the jumpers and cable types do matter </s>
<s> well discussed but no where did i find where you told exactly what you used </s>
<s> could be that issue i noted or could be the jumper and cable issues </s>
<s> but your posts omit details and i didn t duplicate web content on jumpers and cables </s>
<s> makes you wonder if it s one or the other usual issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yeah you are right </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> this hdd was in my external enclosure and i attempted to install xp </s>
<s> computer shutdown with some error </s>
<s> i then booted into the hdd and it continued to install </s>
<s> last question </s>
<s> will this still be a successful install </s>
<s> sorry no need to answer question thanks a lot </s>
<s> is when the machine is sata and can t emulate ide </s>
<s> then when we emulate ide the ide ports can become disabled </s>
<s> the vicious cycle begins </s>
<s> my lesson on this is simple </s>
<s> use an os that supports sata </s>
<s> yes there are procedures that use a floppy drive but what to do when the floppy drive is broke missing and the owner won t fix that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t know the model s size or age of your maxtor and wd drives but can tell you that i ve never seen a specific jumper standard shared by all drive manufacturers or even between product lines from the same manufacturer </s>
<s> since you mentioned using a hd with a cd rom i can tell you that this can often through a real monkey wrench into the works </s>
<s> be careful of quot master quot settings </s>
<s> some will allow that setting if only one drive is installed and some consider that the master jumper position means that a slave exists and you cannot use it with a single hd </s>
<s> what you need is the instructions from the manufacturer for each drive model to figure out their scheme </s>
<s> unfortunately the only experiences i ve ever had with maxtor drives have been bad so i avoid them </s>
<s> i also avoid trying to mix drives from other manufacturers or even vintages </s>
<s> if one is older ide and one is called an eide ultra ata etc i wouldn t mix them on the same cable </s>
<s> maybe if you know the hd model s that might help dig up better information about what jumper settings are valid </s>
<s> hi bob just one question </s>
<s> if i have a faulty ribbon cable in a computer is it ok to swap it with another ribbon cable which fits in the computer and makes the computer work or would the new one spoil my computer </s>
<s> thanks ac </s>
<s> pretty much a generic item </s>
<s> if you researched this you found 2 common models with 3 connectors and two ribbon cable types </s>
<s> if you use the older ribbon cable type the worst that could happen is the drive data is corrupted </s>
<s> the newer ribbon cable type can be used without issue except you have to set the jumpers and the drives must quot like quot each other </s>
<s> i covered the old tech stumper earlier about drives that never work on the same ide channel </s>
<s> this one has caused months of time lost for some techs </s>
<s> some can t wrap their head about that </s>
