<s> i have a dell optiplex gx150 1ghz with 128mb double sided sdram 133mhz installed </s>
<s> i was wanting to install more ram so i saw a single sided 128mb sdram 133mhz stick on ebay </s>
<s> i bought it and installed it </s>
<s> the computer recognized it and upped my memory total to 256mb but crashed during startup sometimes displaying a number in hex that i assume was a memory address other times just stuck with a blinking cursor in the top left hand corner of the screen </s>
<s> it crashed whether it was the only memory module in the computer in the first and then the second slot and whether it was in the first position and the other module was in the second position or vice versa </s>
<s> my question is did i get non functioning ram or would my system not support single sided sdram </s>
<s> install just the new stick </s>
<s> if it crashes then the new stick is not compatible with your system </s>

<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> when i install just the new stick it crashes but i was wondering if the reason was that i got a non functioning stick or if for some reason my pc wasn t able to handle single sided memory </s>
<s> if the new stick on its own doesn t function it s incompatible with your system and not an issue of sides or other such things </s>
<s> cut your losses now time and other and try to obtain a new stick </s>
