<s> i use 3 external storage drives 1 western digital wd passport 250gb 2 hp simple save 500 gb 3 apple ipod nano 4gb i have 2 computer which i will name 1 old pc 2 new pc both running on windows 7 ultimate i use these 3 on separate occasions and they ve worked fine for months on the old pc </s>
<s> then i purchased another one and was also able to use the same drives for a couple of weeks </s>
<s> then one day out of nowhere the pcs failed to recognize the wd hard drive </s>
<s> when i plug it in the light on the wd would turn on and the pc balloon quot usb not recognized quot would pop up </s>
<s> the next day both the hp and the nano also became unrecognizable </s>
<s> i don t recall installing any new software etc </s>
<s> nor dropping the hard drives or getting them wet or whatever </s>
<s> i tried plugging them in on several other computers and the same problem usb device not recognized </s>
<s> a few days after i observed that my new pc also became faulty </s>
<s> it would have blue screens every now and then or sometimes when i start up windows explorer would hang </s>
<s> now i ve tried scanning for viruses using different software getdataback program also won t recognize them and have tried using tune up utilities and uniblue powersuite but to no avail </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the computer still had problems and the drives are still unrecognizable </s>
<s> i had a friend who s good with computers check my pc and he said that the new pc probably had hardware problems since it had static when he opened the casing </s>
<s> but he had no idea regarding the status of my hard drives and couldn t really say if it was caused by the new pc problems </s>
<s> i ll be sending the pc back to where i bought it to have it fixed but for now i d just like to know if is this directly related to the my hard drives becoming unrecognizable </s>
<s> if not what s wrong with them </s>
<s> how can i fix them and save not only the hard drives which cost a lot of money but my files as well </s>
<s> note western digital quot usb not recognized quot balloon pops up when plugged in </s>
<s> light turns on </s>
<s> no clicking sound i ve read in other threads that theirs have clicking sounds but mine doesn t so i guess that s a good thing </s>
<s> device manager under usb controllers unknown device updating the driver won t work since the computers says it s up to date </s>
<s> tried uninstalling then installing no use </s>
<s> device status under unknown device properties quot windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems </s>
<s> code 43 quot disk management not detected </s>
<s> hp simple save no pop up balloon </s>
<s> as if it wasn t plugged in </s>
<s> light turns on </s>
<s> no clicking sound </s>
<s> device manager not detected </s>
<s> disk management not detected </s>
<s> ipod nano no pop up balloon </s>
<s> as if it wasn t plugged in </s>
<s> not recognized by itunes </s>
<s> will work as an mp3 player but won t charge or can t be recognized when plugged into the computer </s>
<s> this is very odd and frustrating </s>
<s> i hope someone can shed some light on my dilemma </s>
<s> i wouldn t want to buy hard drives or replace my nano since that would cost me a lot </s>
<s> and my files are also important </s>
<s> first thing to do get the disk out of the enclosure into a new one </s>
<s> see if that works on a third pc </s>
<s> if so the disk and the data are saved for some usd 20 that s cheap </s>
<s> now make a backup of that data on dvd or another hard disk </s>
<s> that s safe </s>
<s> repeat three times for three disks </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks for the quick response </s>
<s> that might work but take for instance the ipod nano </s>
<s> i can t buy another case for that any other thoughts </s>
<s> if it s damaged in such a way that it doesn t even function in any other pc or mac not even after a reset you need repair or most likely replacement </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> what do you mean by reset </s>
<s> how can i do that </s>
<s> 1 try it on a third pc </s>
<s> 2 still broken </s>
<s> buy a new one or have the old one repaired </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i m using a wd passport 320gb and a seagate 160gb and know how frustrating it gets </s>
<s> i encountered this problem a while back and seriously there was no problem with the hard drives </s>
<s> the problem was actually in the form of a faulty usb hub </s>
<s> the clicking sound as you mentioned is nothing but low voltage </s>
<s> due to it there is not enough voltage to make the disk run and the disk tends to restart </s>
<s> as for non detection of ext hdd s it is a minor glitch that is taken care of by rebooting provided that your pc hasn t stayed on for long </s>
<s> even your problem still persists firstly remove all related device drivers this should be pretty simple if you are using win 7 </s>
<s> reboot it again and check </s>
<s> if you still get the errors open the cabinet and and check whether the usb cables connecting on the motherboard </s>
<s> these are the only things i could come up with since i had the same type of problem and got it fixed while doing hardware changes the cable for usb was left lose </s>
<s> i hope it works out for you </s>
<s> right now i m facing a similar kind of problem but it is with the ext hdd and my lcd tv it detects pendrives but not ext hdd i wonder why tell me when you have a breakthrough pruthvibhushan yahoo co in </s>
<s> i agree with pruthvibhushan </s>
<s> that clicking is low voltage </s>
<s> i m taking it that your quot old pc quot is running 1 0 usb which doesn t have the power for newer externals </s>
<s> add to that your power supply hasn t the umph to push out the juice so to speak </s>
<s> why it stopped working all of a sudden could be anything </s>
<s> you re running updates to programs which blow past your old drivers usb s to you having too much of a load on the house outlet aps ups </s>
<s> why your quot new pc quot is having problems with these drives may be an issue with the drive i agree </s>
<s> on your quot new pc quot is it a completely new pc or an older tower case </s>
<s> why i ask is if you plug your front connections into a new board mother from an old tower case those leads are still old not new </s>
<s> i have that issue with the one tower i use </s>
<s> all of my externals are plugged into the rear alone </s>
<s> additionally you shouldn t run externals drives off a hub </s>
<s> they require a separate power supply as well as usb </s>
<s> that is they don t like to share </s>
<s> which is good in the event that data crosses paths </s>
<s> don t laugh it happens less now than long ago </s>
<s> i d look into the computers on hand first </s>
<s> perhaps your drives are mislabeled between computers </s>
<s> when i swap externals it is registered to that computer with the same letter if i m going to be doing a bunch of serious file saving swapping </s>
<s> but this is more for different os versions when i m running anything less than ntfs on the external </s>
<s> please let us know the outcome </s>
