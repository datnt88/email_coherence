<s> i have a dell dimension 4300 with 2 hard drives an 80 gig and a 40 gig </s>
<s> all of a sudden i get the subject error message </s>
<s> system lites up and i see the dell screen then it beeps twice and posts the error message and f1 to continue f2 to go to setup </s>
<s> tried both but keep coming back to same error </s>
<s> i ve reversed the drives master slave and still get it </s>
<s> i can t believe that both drives died at the same time </s>
<s> when power is on with case open i can feel vibration in the drives as though they are spinning </s>
<s> cooling fans are running </s>
<s> checked power leads to drives with vom and detect voltage present </s>
<s> where do i start cpu motherboard bios </s>
<s> any help appreciated </s>
<s> in the bios to see if the drives are properly seen </s>
<s> then a new 80 pin cable </s>
<s> then try the second ide controller </s>
<s> i suggest you reseat the hd cables several times and check results </s>
<s> try another hd cable new </s>
<s> try with only one hd installed the other disconnected entirely but not removed </s>
<s> make sure jumper reflect what that brand should be for solo hd </s>
<s> if you had this system for sometime maybe the bios cmos battery is weak replace </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> but the cable itself has 80 conductors </s>
<s> 40 extra ground wires </s>
<s> thanks this did it one at a time i installed the drives and discovered that the 15 month old 60gig hard drive is dead </s>
<s> i repaired the installation of win xp on the 40gig drive and system is back up and running </s>
<s> thanks to all for your help </s>
