<s> i have an additional 200gb hdd and only 31 4gb is showing up </s>
<s> it was showing the full 200gb but all of a sudden it is not </s>
<s> i know there is a problem with xp os s without sp1 but i have sp1 and all updates that have been released so it can t be that </s>
<s> my set up athlon xp 2100 512mb ram hdd 1 80gb hdd 2 200gb xp sp1 </s>
<s> i have a theory brewing that a new piece of malware could remove the 48 bit registry entry noted at and cause users too much grief </s>
<s> i m sharing that this is only a theory in that i ve only presented it for testing to quot someone quot and the pest parasite and malware issue seems to be getting worse </s>
<s> it s so bad that a common piece of advice i hand out daily is to not use ie when you can use anything else </s>
<s> why stand in the line of fire </s>
<s> check that registry entry and let us know </s>
<s> if you are doing anything dangerous with your pc such as p2p using ie oe then you may want to move to 137gb drives </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ve run the 48bitlba test and it passed </s>
<s> i have also run ad aware and spybot s d and cleared all malware etc that was found </s>
<s> still not solved the problem </s>
<s> it may have done it s deed </s>
<s> i offered the 48bit test as a test and not a quot solution quot sadly the solution is to use the disk partitioning tool disk management to delete create format the new space again and then restore from your last backup </s>
<s> i don t have a spare machine to see what effect flipping the 48bit registry on and off will do but hope the malware fighters that i noted this to will look into it </s>

<s> are you sure your motherboard supports hd s larger than 31 4gb and if you have been changing jumpers on your hd make sure you havent set the jumper over the 32gb limiting pins its easily done </s>
<s> if your motherboard doesnt support large hdd s then you will need to flash update it check that out at the mb s homesite </s>
<s> its definitely not that as i used to be able to use all of the 200gb capacity and have had it pretty full at one point so my motherboard definitely recognises 200gb hdd s </s>
<s> if you try and format the drive with fat32 then xp has a limit of 32gb </s>
<s> you must use ntfs to get the full 200gb with xp </s>
<s> since you are only getting 32gb it sounds like you are trying to use fat32 </s>
<s> i ve got a feeling you may be right </s>
<s> i think i may have formatted as fat32 </s>
<s> is there a way of partitioning the rest of the hdd as ntfs and have one part fat32 and one part ntfs to save reformating the whole drive or is this not possible </s>
