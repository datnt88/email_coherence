<s> experiencing repeated paper jams </s>
<s> i have thoroughly inspected for any obstructions and have plenty of paper in the feed tray </s>
<s> the paper feeds 1 1 2 inches before jamming and i have to remove the paper by removing the back cover and pulling the paper out backwards </s>
<s> any thoughts are appreciated </s>
<s> while you can try rubber renewal products see amazon com the repair usually and always costs more than a new printer </s>
<s> are you saying the machine itself has a life expectancy of two years </s>
<s> if so why doesn t brother disclose this and further does this apply to any make and model of an quot all in one quot machine </s>
<s> what specifically are you referring to when you say rubber renewal products at amazon com </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you haven t lived through the years of thousand dollar dot matrix printers and the move to lower costs and shorter life spans </s>
<s> your reply is one that i d expect from today s newer owners </s>
<s> this assessment and statement is what i apply to all quot consumer quot printers </s>
<s> the business class machines fare better but you don t see those at the retail venues </s>
<s> here s a rubber renewal for you gt read the comments about this product </s>
