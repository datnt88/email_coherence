<s> all of a sudden my usb drives are running super slow </s>
<s> i made no changes or additions to what is plugged in the drives </s>
<s> whenever i plug in the drive i get quot this drive could perform faster quot which never happened before when i go to load a new large file onto my usb drive portable hd ect </s>
<s> i get 1 mb sec at most </s>
<s> any port i try it in i get the same speed </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> solutions </s>
<s> the owner had updated drivers with windows update or that driver update button </s>
<s> as there is no make or model we can t discuss ideas on where the right drivers might be </s>
<s> this leaves the advice to use system restore to the time before quot sudden quot bob </s>
<s> hp m9350fsuch as this however i do have win7 ultimate on it but the drives were fine after i installed 7 about a year ago </s>
<s> my advice is to use system restore to when it worked </s>
<s> as to the cause the cause continues to be that windows update and accepting drivers most of the time </s>
<s> if that s some hp check hp for motherboard drivers to install and hope </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> scan your system for worm that may have caused degradation in the performance of the usb drive </s>
