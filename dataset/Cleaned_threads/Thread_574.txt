<s> computer specs gateway mx6445 1 79 ghz amd turion 64 mobile tech broadcom 802 11g network adapter driver ver 3 100 64 1 windows xp media center edition sp2 the issue my laptop is constantly disconnected reconnecting </s>
<s> it does so within a matter of seconds but just long enough to log off of online games messengers etc </s>
<s> it happens intermittently but never goes more than an hour without issues </s>
<s> i ve also noticed after a day of monitoring my connection duration that when the signal does die out it doesn t always register as a full disconnect if that makes sense </s>
<s> my messengers will disconnect and webpages won t load but the computer s not registering that it full disconnected from the wireless so it s more like it loses the signal i guess </s>
<s> this wasn t always a problem either i d say it popped up within the last 6 months or so </s>
<s> prior to that i rarely had any problems that weren t related to the router or network itself </s>
<s> i know the issue is not my router or network i have the same problem when i connect to other networks including industrial ones like at the airport </s>
<s> there is also the fact that my husband is running the same exact computer settings etc and his stays connected fine power save feature i have triple checked that this is disabled under the advanced settings for the adapter </s>
<s> distance from the router like i said this happens with multiple networks however when i m at home i m about 2 feet away from the router </s>
<s> my computer doesn t have problems finding the networks and staying connected at decent speeds the problem seems to be staying connected </s>
<s> that s all the information i can think to share if anything additional is needed please let me know </s>
<s> i d really like to find a solution to this problem as it s driving me up a wall </s>
<s> thanks in advance for all your help </s>
<s> given we can create this issue on insecure or wep secured networks why can t it be this network </s>
<s> i read your post twice and can t find the security setup </s>
<s> in short our forum sticky tells a setup we find to help with the issues </s>
<s> a stock settings </s>
<s> b ssid broadcasting </s>
<s> c wpa or wpa2 if you can support it </s>
<s> to be honest i m not sure what the security set up is </s>
<s> i know it s password protected but the network was set up so long ago that i don t remember how it was done </s>
<s> however not being a wireless expert i came to the conclusion that the problem isn t the wireless network based on a my husband has the same computer and is connecting to the same wireless network secured </s>
<s> he sits the same distance away and has absolutely no problems staying connected </s>
<s> my computer is the only one that seems to lose the signal </s>
<s> b i have tried connecting to other unsecured networks that are within range and the same thing happens </s>
<s> my husband s computer will remain connected while mine drops the signal or disconnects and then reconnects or whatever it s doing </s>
<s> like i said in my original post it s enough to disconnect my messengers and not let internet pages load but the duration timer doesn t always reset as it should if the connection fully disconnects </s>
<s> b i was recently traveling and experienced the same dropped signal on the airport s network unsecured as well as at my friend s house secured </s>
<s> their laptops were not having any issues staying connected only mine would drop in and out </s>
<s> my friends laptops were also the same brand though different models though i m fairly certain they d have the same network adapter as i do </s>
<s> d this problem did not exist 6 months or so ago </s>
<s> my computer would stay connected to the wireless network with no problems </s>
<s> the above leads me to believe that somewhere along the line something happened with my machine that is causing this problem </s>
<s> i just can t logically see how the network could possibly be the problem when i am experience the same problem on different networks with different security settings </s>
<s> of course i could be wrong since obviously don t have an every day familiarity with wireless networking settings and nuances but i figured i knew enough to come to the conclusion that the problem is with my computer and how it s connecting to the network rather than the network itself </s>
<s> we have the issue of being able to interfere with a persons wifi if they are on an insecure link such as none or wep </s>
<s> forgive me as i can t write the full detail for each member </s>
<s> this is why we move directly to the forum s suggested setup </s>
<s> after we ve done that there is an issue with some network cards internal to laptops that peter out in a year or so </s>
<s> for that we have another long discussion post in this forum </s>
<s> in short i install a pc card to replace the internal card </s>
<s> some will fight that move but i know the signs and carry the spare card to show it as a fix </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> in the case of the interfering wifi software </s>
<s> it doesn t matter that other machines work </s>
<s> sorry but to explain this takes more than i ll write for each member for which i apologize </s>
<s> we use the forum sticky for that </s>
