<s> i bought norton antivirus 2004 when i installed it on my emachines 667 with 192 mgs of ram it started removing viruses automaticly which i thought was a good thing untill i found out that a lot of the apps on my computer wouldn t work anymore </s>
<s> i ended up having to reformat to get my computer to work again </s>
<s> so i thought i d install the antivirus software first thing since thioreticlly there wouldn t be any viruses on my computer </s>
<s> it still started removing quot viruses quot and things wouldn t work again and i had to reformat again </s>
<s> how can this software do me any good if it disables my most used software in the process of doing what it does </s>
<s> one of the viruses that it removed when i installed it right after reformating was called quot stator quot </s>
<s> how could there be a virus on my factory installed software </s>
<s> after reformating that was all that was on my quot c quot drive </s>
<s> i do have a quot d quot slave hard drive but the apps that it was disabling were on the quot c quot drive </s>
<s> the slave drive has mostly music files on it </s>
<s> i can t use my antivirus software untill i find out how to install it and still have a functional computer </s>
<s> has anyone had a similir experience </s>
<s> does anyone know the solution to this problem </s>
<s> i would appreciate any feedback anyone can give me </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> given the over 70 thumbs down at i continually am surprised that people try their luck with the 2004 version </s>
<s> please don t expect me to fix symantec s mess </s>
<s> in fact i see no indication you called symantec </s>
<s> what i would do </s>
<s> if i have an application that fails i uninstall and reinstall it </s>
<s> for me this is easy </s>
<s> others may need help </s>
<s> as to the 2004 version my advice is quot get a refund quot and get any other av other than mcafee </s>
<s> again you are not alone with this issue but it s clear that 2004 is not a good year for symantec </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> like norton was removing spyware </s>
<s> some programs that contain spyware will not operate if the spyware is removed </s>
<s> these programs are the quot freebies quot that you install from the net </s>
<s> that s why they are free </s>
<s> your choice get the full featured program and pay for it </s>
