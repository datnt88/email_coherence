<s> what s the best method to clean out my old hard drives of data and viruses for reuse </s>
<s> i have some older internal hard drives that i d like to convert into external drives so i can use them for backups on my new machine </s>
<s> now some of these drives have viruses and malware on them and i d like to completely wipe them free of them so they will not come back to bite me </s>
<s> should i use an antivirus like avast to quarantine the viruses and malware first and then use cc cleaner to do a single pass setting and reformat the drive </s>
<s> would that be efficient enough </s>
<s> or is there a better method to reformat these drives to ensure they are clean and ready for reuse </s>
<s> bottom line what would you do </s>
<s> thanks in advance for the advice </s>
<s> submitted by graham p </s>
<s> if you have no intention of trying to retrieve data from the older drives why not simply reformat the check the disc integrity </s>
<s> i have never found a virus or malware on a freshly formated drive </s>
<s> if they are already infected i take them to a separate machine that has an antivirus installed one that i use just for this purpose plug them in as external devices and immediately format them at least twice </s>
<s> not the quick format option but the full format </s>
<s> if there is sensitive data on the drive then i use a wiping method that does at least 7 passes or the data can be retrieved using various tools </s>
<s> so to sum up you can plug them into a different computer that has the antivirus installed right click on the drive and then hit format or tools format depending on the os </s>
<s> if there is sensitive data on the drive that you don t want retrieved ever use the ccleaner wipe feature with 7 passes minimum or use eraser </s>
<s> format the drive using the full method </s>
<s> then open a command prompt and run quot cipher w x quot without the quotes where x is the drive letter of the drive in question </s>
<s> this works for windows os es from windows 2000 onward </s>
<s> for vista windows 7 and i assume windows 8 you will probably have to run cmd as an administrator </s>
<s> this method uses tools format and cipher available within the os no need to download anything </s>
<s> use dban burn the iso to a dvd put the hard drives in a computer with no other hard drives connected boot dban up choose a wiping algorithm dod short would be fine and then let it wipe </s>
<s> it ll have all the data wiped and safe for you to format quick format in windows and be clear of viruses </s>
<s> reformatting is the best thing you can do </s>
<s> however while not necessary you can use disk wiper tools like eraser or ccleaner </s>
<s> these tools will rewrite every sector of data with new data </s>
<s> any virus hiding will be overwritten but like i said reformatting should be enough </s>
<s> but on the plus side doing a full disk rewrite will make it very difficult for any one to recover any data that is on the hard drive </s>
<s> even if you reformat the drive data can still be recover </s>
<s> and you can you encrypted backup to make you data safe in case someone steal your hard drives </s>
<s> also don t do a full rewrite on ssd solid state drives it will not work property and you will use up more of the read write cycles </s>
<s> use the disk manufacturers software or acronis to set up the drives as new ones </s>
<s> then do a full reformat </s>
<s> i ve used dban on dozens of drives both ide and sata over the last couple of years </s>
<s> i have never had a problem </s>
<s> i keep an old pc set up at work to boot from the cd then i can just plug a drive in power up and type autonuke at the prompt to wipe the drive </s>
<s> viruses and spyware generally reside as programs files and the data are usually fine </s>
<s> therefore as long as no programs can run from that drive you will be able to work on in internally </s>
<s> quick format on your own computer will work as long as the infected drive is a secondary drive and you will be the one using it again </s>
<s> this will just delete files which will only change the first bit of the name and make to rest of the sectors available to be written over </s>
<s> this quick and dirty method will be fine as long as you just start using the disk it will be fine overwriting all files over time </s>
<s> the upside is convenience </s>
<s> the other side i don t say downside because it may not be is that the files could be recovered as long those particular locations have not been overwritten </s>
<s> the next level is a full format which is really not different form quick format except it also reads sector by soector and locates bad sectors separating them out </s>
<s> wiping as offered with ccleaner or other programs mentioned </s>
<s> that will will overwrite the sector making recovery almost impossible </s>
<s> the more times it is over written the more secure the disk </s>
<s> hi graham good to know that you intend to re cycle your old hd s </s>
<s> smart move and you save money </s>
<s> i d agree with the other community members that reformatting the drives is all that you need do </s>
<s> just make sure to use the full format option and not the quick format </s>
<s> after formatting you can still run a virus malware removal program </s>
<s> although i d be surprised if the program detects anything </s>
<s> but you never know and you can never be too safe when dealing in the cyber world of computers </s>
<s> so do what makes you feel the safest </s>
<s> there s one other option and that s to take the drives to a professional and let them sanitize the drive s </s>
<s> of course you ll pay a price for that type of service </s>
<s> graham you said these are old quot internal quot hd s </s>
<s> that means either a you ve already removed them or b they are still inside another computer yet to be removed if b then hopefully the computer is still operable so that you can perform the reformat operation if not you ll have to remove the drive </s>
<s> after removing the drive you still have to make it recognizable as a hd to another computer that is capable of running the reformat option not to mention recognizable to be used as a storage device </s>
<s> not to worry you can purchase a usb enclosure that will make the drive recognizable to any computer and format able to any os </s>
<s> just purchase the right size enclosure for the drive </s>
<s> as a rule most laptop hd s are 2 5 inch and case hd s are 3 5 inch </s>
<s> 2 5 inch drives in a case are rare but not unheard of </s>
<s> the next step in buying the proper enclosure is to determine if the hd you are wanting to convert to external storage is ide or sata </s>
<s> if it is the former be sure to purchase an enclosure that is ide to usb as there is a necessary circuitry conversion to make the ide hd recognizable to the modern computer which are commonly built with sata controllers </s>
<s> firewire connection is available on some enclosures </s>
<s> once you have the hd snugly in its new enclose plug it in to any usb equipped computer and run the full format option </s>
<s> windows will format the drive to ntfs standards </s>
<s> apple products will format the drive to hfs </s>
<s> if you would like to use the same drive between a windows and a mac os then format the drive to fat32 </s>
<s> fyi some enclosures come with a power supply and others may have two usb connections to draw sufficient power </s>
<s> but in most scenarios a single usb connection is all that is required for the 5400 rpm hd </s>
<s> hd enclosures can be purchased from just about any well known computer retailer either on line or brick n mortar including amazon and ebay </s>
<s> those made from aluminum or a metal alloy are the best as they dissipate heat more effectively </s>
<s> prices range from 7 00 to 50 00 although i d avoid the bargain basement price </s>
<s> you get what you pay for </s>
<s> i hope this information is helpful </s>
<s> good luck with your project </s>
<s> t ogether e veryone a chieves m ore </s>
<s> with ether one you can boot into a linux environment and then safely format or dod scrub the disks </s>
<s> hi graham good advice so far </s>
<s> what i would do is download the live cd version of partition wizard iso and burnit to a cd then boot from the cd </s>
<s> use partition modify hide partition to hide all the disk s you don t want to reformat </s>
<s> this isn t strictly necessary but it will prevent any possibility of infection from the disks you are reclaiming </s>
<s> then for each disk you want to reclaim use partition wizard partition delete and select the quot secure erase quot option </s>
<s> for all partitions on the disk </s>
<s> this will delete the partition s and overwrite with binary zeros </s>
<s> your disk is now clean and empty </s>
<s> use partition wozard to allocate whatever partition s you want to define on the disk you might even want to rebuild the mbr master boot record to make sure that is clean too </s>
<s> when you ve done this for all disks unhide the partitions you originally hid and reboot the machine into windows </s>
<s> format full format all of the new partitions you created above and you are done </s>
<s> this will take some time but you can guarantee there is no malware on any of the diisks </s>
<s> good lick </s>
<s> use your windows os install disk to delete all existing partitions create as many paritions as you want one partition using all the available space would be fine and format </s>
<s> don t complete the os installation since you only need storage </s>
<s> with the price of externals today i cant imagine your saving any money by doing what you are doing especially since you have to ask in a forum about existing viruses you say you have already and assuming they do have a virus and just not defective in general </s>
<s> you can buy thumbdrives bigger than an old hard drive or get cloud </s>
<s> if you think a cloud is made out of water vapor then i would suggest using a ps3 for your computing needs </s>
<s> if you ve got the drive bays you can eliminate the external case and usb esata cables handling etc </s>
<s> my sense drives are a whole lot more reliable when used as internals than as externals </s>
<s> just read the cnet forums they re full of tearful please about problems with external hdds </s>
<s> good luck vapcmd </s>
<s> as far as data is concerned including the toughest virus and malware by using ddban </s>
<s> you have multiple methods of erasing right up to military secrecy strength of erasure which will allow for any level of paranoia like mine </s>
<s> virus like conficker downadup were able to reactivate after quick format although full format got the job done but there is nothing like not having that nagging doubt </s>
<s> i would reformat and repartition </s>
<s> best way to make sure it is as clean as it can be </s>
<s> the best thing to do to clean old hard drives is to remove it from computer connect to different computer via usb or as internal slave and format it twice any data will be cleaned off it </s>
<s> unless you are worried the cia or mi5 will recover something top secret a full format will do the job </s>
<s> you don t need anything else </s>
<s> glenlo at first glance judging from the title of your response it appeared that it may have had merit </s>
<s> wrong </s>
<s> everyone in this community has the right to ask a legitimate question without being subjected to ridicule or vicious insensitive comments for having asked </s>
<s> sarcastic pseudo intellectuals like you who can t seem to see pass their own nose are the individuals who need reprimanding and correction </s>
<s> it appears to me that your head may be composed of quot water vapor quot more on that later and obviously stuck in a quot cloud quot of ignorance stupidity and a lack of consideration for others </s>
<s> now as far as the composition of a cloud here are couple of links that may enlighten you because judging from your sarcastic comment you may actually believe that the composition of a cloud is entirely of quot water vapor quot </s>
<s> there are virus that can exist after a format these reside in the mbr or the quot drive fat quot that helps eliminate bad drive areas quot part of the manufacturing process </s>
<s> these are real sneaky or profound threats so don t discount their presence while formatting can work for typical re use i find using a quot disk wiper quot better suited </s>
<s> the wiper doesn t format per se but does clean any old data and setting or os fat tables once done you use the os setup which will format as usual and prepare the hd </s>
<s> i had great success with dban and killdisk both free versions run once and then later reformat hd for use </s>
<s> also take a grain of advise don t use too old of hds they still crash even in ext </s>
<s> usb cases </s>
<s> a good 16gb flash drive is better for typical use rather than dragging an 40gb around even if more space but you can use it all once practiced </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> you format those drive and if you want to make shure that evrything is erase you can use file shredder it s a freeware that you can find there this freeware will be helpfull over every drive you have </s>
<s> instead of using the thrash can you can safely erase what you really don t need </s>
<s> after using file shredder your drive will be clean as a brand new one </s>
<s> i have always used micro2000 s eraser disk </s>
<s> extract from their website reads quot protect the security and privacy of your confidential data </s>
<s> sterilize old hard drives with eraserdisk a utility for decommissioning drives correctly followed by low level formatting the disk </s>
<s> these actions exceed the us government s security requirements of d0d 5520 22 m the most prevalent standard for cleaning a hard drive </s>
<s> wipe the hard drive clean with up to seven disk erase passes that over write with varied data including a low level format for complete sterilization and use the test utility to make sure you ve really wiped that drive clean quot it costs around 40 but is well worth it </s>
<s> i have also used the disk to low level format new drives </s>
<s> mike m </s>
<s> this is the windows nt based win 2000 thru 7 disk management software </s>
<s> start it up delete the old disk partition format and then reboot </s>
<s> if its absolutely necessary to prevent contact with your current system go the drive manufacturer s web site get their maintenance software and have it format with a preference for a quot low level quot format if applicable </s>
<s> a low level format is what the factory does before it ships and new hard out of the factory testing and erasing everything and keeping track of know errors that occur during manufacture </s>
<s> if you do this you will catch and new bad sectors that may have developed over the years if the hard drive locks these out windows will never try to use them again </s>
<s> most manufacturers have an iso volume that you can burn to cd dvd and boot your machine with it after attaching the new drives </s>
<s> this requires great detail and choose the wrong drive and it s quot bye bye irreplaceable pictures of auntie agnes quot and nice job using technology to its physical limits i ve had 12 yo drives that ran perfectly fine but just made me nervous so i finally retired the old things </s>
<s> they eventually make nice clocks lol </s>
<s> i have formatted and re used many hdds both my own and drives obtained from others a complette format and installation of an operating system has prooved successfull as long as the drive is working ok however even after formatting the files are still recoverable </s>
<s> these files should not cause any problems </s>
<s> if you want to see these files install a recovery program </s>
<s> search cnet for pandora recovery software this is a free program and will find 1000s of files on a formatted drive </s>
<s> the only way to clean a drive is to quot destroy quot it </s>
<s> hi you can download this program for free i cant remember the name of the site it could have been on cnet </s>
<s> this program called revo uninstaller it has a program called quot unrecoverable delete quot just click on tools in revo and scroll down to the bottom of the page it will be on the left side </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i ve read all the comments and not one of them mentioned whether the drive was worth saving </s>
<s> today s new drives are so superior to those even just a few years ago were the norm </s>
<s> a new hard drive is not that expensive </s>
<s> unless you just have to do it first check to make sure you have some life in that old hard drive </s>
<s> reformatting is enough in some cases </s>
<s> however there are viruses that survive formatting most recently the fbi virus and in the past msblast </s>
<s> so to save time and cover all my bases </s>
<s> i delete the partition create a new partition and then format </s>
<s> i have never had a virus survive that so far </s>
<s> i realize this isn t technically an answer to your question but why mess around when you can spend 50 75 bucks on a decent sized drive that s new and reliable </s>
<s> i use killdisk to clean my drives </s>
<s> freeware that does a good job </s>
<s> just put in on a cd floppy thumb drive and boot to it and run the program </s>
<s> this is assuming you re not interested in any of the data on the drive </s>
<s> i use it at work to clean the drives of old replaced pcs before we dispose of them </s>
<s> typically we donate them or offer them for free to whoever wants them </s>
<s> it saves us the cost of recycling </s>
<s> people can get a usable pc that s still good for most everyday use </s>
<s> usually 4 5 years old </s>
<s> purchase wipe drive it completely wipes your hard drive </s>
<s> formatting and repartitioning does not delete data </s>
<s> quote you said quot everyone in this community has the right to ask a legitimate question without being subjected to ridicule or vicious insensitive comments for having asked </s>
<s> sarcastic pseudo intellectuals like you who can t seem to see pass their own nose are the individuals who need reprimanding and correction </s>
<s> quot and then you said quot it appears to me that your head may be composed of quot water vapor quot more on that later and obviously stuck in a quot cloud quot of ignorance stupidity and a lack of consideration for others quot it s ironic that you say the same thing that you claim to dislike so much </s>
<s> shame on you </s>
<s> if the hard drives are decent size for storage then i would just try any one of the methods mentioned by the many different inputs from others </s>
<s> reformatting by using the os is a great way to do it </s>
<s> but if the drives are small and old school ide drives then maybe it s time to spend a little bit of cash and invest in a new sata drive for storage </s>
<s> get a big one at least 1tb that has 32mb cache or greater </s>
<s> and yes trying to reuse instead of tossing away is always a good thing </s>
<s> i was reading through the answers and noticed something missing at least from what i ve used with my own practices </s>
<s> in the days past i used to first use fdisk to delete the mbr s from any disc i was going to reuse whereupon i would create a new mbr and do a full format followed by check disc scandisk now </s>
<s> with full and fix arguments </s>
<s> as others have noted a full format should do the trick but in the fat32 days and previous there were copies of boot records that a few tricky viruses would contaminate </s>
<s> partition magic was a program i used to also use to more easily mess with boot records and such using a gui </s>
<s> it also gave some pretty obscure options to use for formatting which i would think would scramble things nicely </s>
<s> i believe you could disconnect any quot good quot drives you have in your computer connect the drive s you want to wipe and boot from the cd with partition magic on it or another utility of the same nature wipe the discs and away you go to install it into an enclosure of your choice </s>
<s> nice job of one of the other reviewers to make sure you are using a pata or sata that applies to the disc s in question however getting an enclosure that will work for you might be worth doing a little research and looking for ratings on such </s>
<s> i have several enclosures from way back when and remember that a couple of them worked well and a couple didn t </s>
<s> they also make a handy little cable that comes with a power supply </s>
<s> you can plug it into a usb port and connect it to 3 5 quot and 2 5 quot pata drives as well as sata drives </s>
<s> i use that thing much more often than i use the enclosures </s>
<s> i also like some of the quot drive caddy quot sorts of options that are available if you have many drives you want to use for data or what not </s>
<s> you can just basically have it on your desk top and plug a drive into it use it for what you need and remove it without having to have several external cases for each drive if you have several hope any of this is useful to you </s>
<s> fr </s>
<s> if you are concerned that malware could be on the drives boot from a copywipe cd and wipe the drive i recommend unplugging your main drive and only connecting the drive you want to wipe </s>
<s> using this method your operating system will not be active so there should be no way to infect the boot drive </s>
<s> copywipe will wipe every sector on the disk </s>
<s> if you have old drives it is probably better to wipe and recycle them than use them </s>
<s> old drives are slower and may not be reliable </s>
<s> copywipe can do multiple writes with random data so that your data cannot be retrieved </s>
<s> dear all my apologies for adding to the question but i did not know hoe to proceed </s>
<s> i too am keen to know the same with one added question please let me know how i can use my older hdds as external storage devices </s>
<s> do i have to buy a special external connector with power supply </s>
<s> how does it work </s>
<s> i am really keen to know the technicalities </s>
<s> i have a sata 160 gb and an ide 40 gb hdd which i would love to put to use to store data externally </s>
<s> please do help with this question </s>
<s> with thanks </s>
<s> i work as a dst and hold multiple tech certs and there are some good ideas in this thread </s>
<s> a few things to keep in mind there are viruses and malware which can reside in the boot sectors </s>
<s> kaspersky has a free tool for getting rid of these which a standard format cannot remove </s>
<s> after running this check the integrity of the drive bygoing into a command line and run chkdsk r f reboot as needed </s>
<s> after chkdsk completes reboot the system </s>
<s> you are now ready to wipe the drive ccleaner can do this but not recommended as wiping a drive while it s in use may not fully wipe everything especially the mbr records </s>
<s> it s best to use a bootable flash drive with a wipe program </s>
<s> i prefer wipedrive </s>
<s> the pro version does a dod level wipe </s>
<s> however the free version is fine for standard users especially if you are planning to reuse them again </s>
<s> you need to write the disk to 0 s in order to ensure that all the old data is gone </s>
<s> in particular with hard drives that contained windows at some point in time this is particularly important </s>
<s> windows likes to add files that can t be overwritten even with a re formatting of the drive </s>
<s> it s best to download a utility from the hard drive manufacturer western digital has a good one that will write the disk to 0 s </s>
<s> once you do that there is no way that any data that was previously on there could possibly survive </s>
<s> before formatting first delete all the partitions which is very strong and then start building new partions or just one </s>
<s> after formatting the new partions or partition you have a safe drive </s>
<s> don t bother about your polluted data </s>
<s> in the future make sure that you don t get any virusses or what ever </s>
<s> and if you are still afraid just use malware bytes </s>
<s> it is a free program that deletes all your malware </s>
<s> i would suggest darik s boot and nuke this utility will completely erase the drive </s>
<s> it is also available on the ultimate boot cd which has many great utilities </s>
<s> there is an easier way you can buy an adapterset which connects a bare drive via usb with the pc </s>
<s> the adapter is equipped with a power supply so you can use all kinds of drives </s>
<s> it is also cheaper than a case </s>
<s> gerhard </s>
<s> blessings i tried what you suggested reformatting the sata drive </s>
<s> after wiping i went to restart and now it is asking for a password </s>
<s> i didn t password protect this drive so i don t know what is going on </s>
<s> 1 how can i get past the request for password screen </s>
<s> 2 do i need another reformat </s>
<s> 3 is there something else i can do to solve this problem </s>
<s> thanks deborah </s>
<s> i ll assume that you have retrieved any data you still wanted from these drives </s>
<s> given that there was malware on those drives you want to ensure that any retrieved files are clean use a virus protected system to check the copies </s>
<s> then if you remove the partition s and repartition the drive all that s needed is a thorough full format </s>
<s> except you may still have a boot sector virus on the drive </s>
<s> and if you do you probably have the same virus on all drives on all systems that you have connected your old drives to </s>
<s> so you do want to treat those old drives as suspect until you have checked them with a virus scanner </s>
<s> once they are reformatted the virus scanner will run much faster and the only possible place where it could still find a virus would be the boot sector area </s>
<s> yes kill disk </s>
<s> google it and click on the cnet download for active killdisk </s>
<s> it writes zeros across the drive and leaves it perfectly clean </s>
<s> much better than reformatting which doesn t clean the drive </s>
<s> there is only one way to make sure the drive is clean and that is to zero fill it </s>
<s> as we know everything on computers comes down to 1 s and zeros </s>
<s> you can buy a disk at staples that will convert everything to zeros </s>
<s> i bought it from a company called iolo for 20 its called drivescrubber </s>
<s> here s a cool thing in addition </s>
<s> since hard drives are metal and work on magnetism there is always a chance that a tiny snippet of magnetism is left over lets call it residual </s>
<s> the same disk can write encryption over everything on the drive before putting zeros on it </s>
<s> in fact the department of defense standards is to write encryption 7 times over everything before zero filling </s>
<s> this disk can do that but one pass plus zeros is good enough </s>
<s> antivirus programs can only get rid of viruses they know to exist and there are always people out there making new ones that might not be known and pout into av software definition lists </s>
<s> for that reason you really cant rely on av software </s>
<s> also a lot of people will tell you that removing the partition on a disk will clean it but actually it just makes it ready to add stuff on top of whats still there </s>
<s> zero filling is the only real way to wipe a hard drive </s>
<s> i suggest you read glenlo s post again </s>
<s> it wasn t a question imo but a very sarcastic commentary on graham s post </s>
<s> i stand by my original reply to glenlo </s>
<s> it appears as of this writing that other astute members agree 12 </s>
<s> however i realize there will always be those who disagree 3 as do you </s>
<s> open discourse is what this forum is about and sometimes requires one to read between the lines in order to fully grasp the true meaning of what is actually being communicated </s>
<s> if i interpreted glenlo s remarks incorrectly then my apologies </s>
<s> i hope you continue to participate in this forum and i look forward to reading your comments suggestions to graham s and future questions posted in this forum </s>
<s> together everyone achieves more </s>
<s> if these drives are going to be used for storage and what s currently on there doesn t matter then i highly recommend you just wipe em out </s>
<s> formatting is fine usually but there s always bits of info strewn about and they still might cause security concerns </s>
<s> the best option is to just wipe em out using either freeware software like dban or paid software such as wipe drive </s>
<s> i use wipe drive actually </s>
<s> i recommend spending the dough it s worth it </s>
<s> it will wipe every sector of the hard drive ever piece of data every virus all of it gone </s>
<s> replaces it with random empty 0 s and 1 s </s>
<s> when you put the drives back to use they ll need to be formatted as the system will see them as brand new hard drives </s>
<s> like you had just pulled them out of the box </s>
<s> it s time consuming i won t lie but it s worth it </s>
<s> i agree buy a new hard drive </s>
<s> why backup from a 500 to a 120 the best way to wipe clean is lay it on the driveway and drive over it a number of times </s>
<s> if you are sure you did not protect the drive you can press enter to get past it </s>
<s> otherwise you ll want to download hirems boot recovery onto a flash drive </s>
<s> if you are using a non admin account on win7 then to reactivate a volume drive you need to login as admin or enter the admin password to register the device on the system if the drive is installed internally </s>
<s> there should not be a password for a non encrypted drive </s>
<s> if you did format the drive and then used file system encryption then you have a problem </s>
<s> to break the encryption request a linux live cd or usb stick will do the trick </s>
<s> it is also very handy for blanking drives </s>
<s> if the drive is installed within the computer it will be listed in the partitioning program as sda if it is the primary drive and if it is the second drive it will show up as sdb </s>
<s> either way you will be able to see where you have your existing windows os installed usually this will show up as drive sda but not always </s>
<s> just make certain you do not wipe your existing windows or just unplug the drive that you have it on and be certain you do not format anything other than the drive you want to nuke and or reformat </s>
<s> the partitioning program will unmount the drive which in turn stops the ntfs file encryption request then you simply reformat to ntfs without drive encryption </s>
<s> the encryption request is at the beginning of the drive so you need to blank to unformatted first remove partition </s>
<s> make sure that the drive is then seen as nothing but free space </s>
<s> do not forget that if you use another file system other than ntfs or vfat your drive will not be seen as a file system under windows </s>
<s> if you did encrypt the drive then you must be using vista win7 or xp pro as drive encryption is not available with the quot home quot versions </s>
<s> as to how to wipe a drive with linux it is a breeze with command line </s>
<s> if you open a terminal window with a live cd or usb stick your installed primary drive will show up as sda </s>
<s> the command to wipe the drive by overwriting is without the quotes quot dd if dev sda of dev urandom quot if your live cd or usb stick mounted the drive automatically then you will need to simply unmount the drive and blank the drive without a mounted file system </s>
<s> in linux the same as most unix and bsd systems and windows for that matter drives are accessible as system devices even if you cannot read the file system on the drive because you have unmounted the file system </s>
<s> essentially all dd does with this command is write random numbers to all sectors of the drive including the boot sector so it will be completely blank of data </s>
<s> it can take a long time if your drive is a big one but this is essentially what commercial drive wiping software does </s>
<s> this causes huge amounts of confusion with users who do not understand the difference between the device and the file system on the device </s>
<s> think of it simply as a device and you will see what i am getting at the file system is on the device and needs to be indexed on the running operating system as a file system that can be read </s>
<s> however if you unmount in linux the command umount then the device can still be written to even though it cannot be read by the higher level of the os that reads file systems </s>
<s> dd is a core program that writes to devices and does not care about file systems </s>
<s> windows does exactly the same thing but obscures how it actually does things and makes users find freeware to do things that only the quot pro quot versions do </s>
<s> without quotes the command to blank a drive is quot dd if dev urandom of dev sda quot if the drive you want to blank is sdb then substitute sdb for sda </s>
<s> in the original post i reversed the syntax by mistake </s>
<s> if means the file or device you are writing from quot if quot just stands for input file of means the device or file that you are writing the input to dead simple and really reliable like most great stuff </s>
<s> i always use dd before i sell an old computer with a drive and no os installed </s>
<s> silly as it sounds an old scsi drive that i once purchased at a used computer store actually had all of a dentists patient files on it unencrypted </s>
<s> fortunately i am not the type that snoops but the so called windows it guy that sold off the computer parts should have known better </s>
<s> consider this we lack perfection systems fail ups s run out of juice generators run out of fuel the cloud is no more secure than any properly designed self storage </s>
<s> they are ide drives not sata my new machine is sata and i didn t want to deal with it i guess i ve had good luck with the electronics of my machines on the other hand most of my problems have been anti mal ware that didn t work as advertised </s>
<s> one of the above drives was infested with mal ware and my anti virus soft ware didn t warn me </s>
