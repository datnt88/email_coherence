<s> i believe those cylindrical things just south of the cpu mount is the heatsink for the northbridge on the motherboard </s>
<s> not that side i mean the opposite side the closest things to the cpu </s>

<s> i gave u the wrong link heres the real one </s>

<s> hahaha </s>
<s> i was wondering why the case link was there </s>
