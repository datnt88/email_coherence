<s> im gonna tell it like it is here when it comes to my problem </s>
<s> i live in philadelphia and i have access to over a dozen or so wireless connections from my living room </s>
<s> im not stealing in the respect that im breaking the law since the ones im using are meant to be for free they re named free2use 1 and such </s>
<s> ive been using these connections in my living room for months now downloading and watching movies with my girlfriend instantly on netflix without problems </s>
<s> lately though connections sever more and more regularly and connections that have always been strong and regular are now weaker </s>
<s> for instance the roofing business 4 doors down was once 4 bars and now is barely 1 nowadays </s>
<s> i know the owner and have talked to him about it </s>
<s> his connection is fine they have not moved any equipment so it must be my computer </s>
<s> i downloaded the updated networking driver for windows xp and it did nothing to change my situation </s>
<s> i am using windows xp home edition with an intel r pro wireless 3945abg net network adapter to connect to the internet </s>
