<s> i m a senior getting ready for college next year </s>
<s> a little early i know </s>
<s> but this is the last christmas before college </s>
<s> anyway i have asked for a netbook dell mini 10v </s>
<s> however i am torn between whether i should get the netbook or the money for it </s>
<s> i plan on getting a macbook before college and hopefully apple will have a back to school deal </s>
<s> i just dont know if it would be worth it </s>
<s> my gut is it would but i dont have both yet so i cant be sure </s>
<s> anyone have both a netbook and normal sized comp in a college environment </s>
<s> what are you thoughts </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i have your average laptop and use the netbook for presentations and quick trips out of the office </s>
<s> i find it nice to have a machine that i don t have a big investment in </s>
<s> but frankly if i had a 13 inch macbook i think i d not need the netbook </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if i were you i would hold off on the netbook and put that money towards a laptop </s>
<s> using some simple reasoning i m guessing by next school year you will have around 1 400 to spend which could get you a laptop that will not only be easy to take to class but also powerful enough to do everything you need well </s>
<s> if you feel like shopping around now to get an idea of what you are looking for give this link a try if you shop around when it comes time to buy you can always find a deal on a pc cheers </s>
