<s> i use my epson stylus photo 785epx printer a lot and it seems that i have to do the head cleaning routine every two or three days usually the black ink check pattern has gaps </s>
<s> ayway i found the following site that has a lot of information about epson head cleaning and a link to download a program ssc service utility that allows cleaning selected print heads instead of all of them i haven t tried the single head cleaning yet but the ssc service utility looks interesting and does all kinds of stuff with the printer </s>
<s> by the way i refill my cartridges and have excellent results although i am sure refilling isn t for everyone and don t tell me the refill ink clogs the heads </s>
<s> i don t clean the heads any more than i had to with new epson ink cartridges </s>
<s> interesting post fitz as a printer engineer mostly my company insists that if the user is using refills 3rd party consumables we should walk away </s>
<s> i had hp refills a few years ago for my deskjet 690c and they were terrible ink bled smudged took a long time to dry etc </s>
<s> recently i needed to print some stuff but was skint so i went to a local cartridge world type place </s>
<s> the result really impressed me and i would recommend the shop </s>
<s> however where laser toner cartridges are concerned the story is not so good </s>
<s> i have seen leaks of toner poor quality due to the drum having marks on it or repeated lines caused by problems within the cartridges </s>
<s> they don t seem to last very long either so maybe toners are in a different league from ink cartridges </s>
<s> one of the things the ssc service utility does is make my printer produce a horrible grinding noise when i used the utility to quot move head to exchange position quot </s>
<s> so pass on this utility </s>
