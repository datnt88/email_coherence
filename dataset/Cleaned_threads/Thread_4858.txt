<s> hey alright so i ve been having this probelm for awhile but now its really not working </s>
<s> the first time it happen was when i restarted my computer one time it just shutdown and didn t turn back on then it wouldn t turn on </s>
<s> what the computer does is the power light turns on i can hear my fan getting a lot of air </s>
<s> the probelm is my computer has a huge fan so it doens t always run at full speed </s>
<s> just when it starts up for about 2 3 seconds then if it gets hot </s>
<s> when i turn on my computer and i get the probelm my van just keeps sucking in air </s>
<s> its like my computer is working fine and it turns on but its only working right for abut 1 second </s>
<s> after that second it like freezes or something it just sits there </s>
<s> my lights turn on my dvd rom trys reading my cd s but my montior just stays black </s>
<s> the computer some times after awhile turns on normal but only after i turn it on and off many times each time it always a differnt of times and this time it wont just turn on </s>
<s> if any one has any ideas please thanks mythraz </s>
<s> 1 you may go for check connecting a different monitor </s>
<s> if it works then after start deleat all driver files of earlier monitor </s>
<s> then reconnect earlier monitor and put correct driver and set correct setting of monitor i e </s>
<s> 24 or 32 bit and 800x600 or very apropriate which monitor can sustain see the monitor manual </s>
<s> 2 if 1 above does not work then please post the number of addon cards present in your pc and also video detail i e </s>
<s> onboard or agp or pci </s>
<s> will try then after </s>
<s> most monitors do not require a driver your problem might be the monitor itself or a connection for the monitor but not a driver </s>
<s> in most cases as yours replacing the psu with a good one of equal wattage or better is the 1st step in a repair process </s>
<s> however it maybe possible the mtrbd </s>
<s> or another compoent has failed </s>
<s> the fans etc </s>
<s> turning on only suggests that at 12v is working there are other voltages and likely one rail v outputs has failed or been stripped of the amps it needs to turn things on </s>
<s> the clue is repeated attempts may get the system going </s>
<s> the mtrbd </s>
<s> may have a failed capacitor cap that blown or leaked etc a user can reduce the power demand by reducing the system thus a possible clue if it boots up </s>
<s> that s no cure it just points int he right direct replace psu </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
