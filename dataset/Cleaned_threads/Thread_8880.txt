<s> i m not really a computer person but my grandmother recently asked me to help her pick out a new computer </s>
<s> i really want to make sure she gets something that will suit her needs and not give her any trouble </s>
<s> here s what is important for it to have reliability </s>
<s> good customer support </s>
<s> ability to read digital camera media cards </s>
<s> sufficient speed to watch videos online </s>
<s> sufficient memory for her pictures she doesn t take a ton of them though so i imagine 320gb would be enough </s>
<s> cd dvd burner </s>
<s> windows 7 small size tower would be nice </s>
<s> what s not important multimedia capabilities she doesn t even have an hd tv in the house </s>
<s> gaming capabilities </s>
<s> blu ray </s>
<s> upgrade ability </s>
<s> the most important thing is that it will be reliable </s>
<s> she knows nothing about computers and i live a ways away so she always has to pay someone to look at her computer when something goes wrong </s>
<s> she would also like to keep the price under 500 but at or under 400 would be better tower only </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
<s> if i were in the marker for a new desktop and ws not going to build one myself i would probabally buy an asus brand from a reliability standpoint </s>
<s> whatever you do stay away from anyting hp or compaq </s>
<s> their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible </s>
<s> the specs may compare but is the quality of the parts that matter </s>
<s> there are quite a few options </s>
<s> maybe get a slim tower with monitor deal at one of the big box retailers </s>
<s> you might consider finding a desktop someone doesn t need and loading a linux distro it should suit her needs and may be less complicated than windows </s>
<s> i don t think brands matter too much for desktops </s>
<s> for laptops i would be more leary of reliability because parts aren t easy to replace </s>
<s> the only 2 parts that may differ by who made your motherboard is the motherboard and power supply </s>
<s> almost all the companies will have a generic psu so no difference </s>
<s> all companies will probably use a custom motherboard too </s>
<s> as for the quality of the motherboard being less than that you can get if you build yourself yes its true </s>
<s> but i think they re on par with the other value motherboards you can buy albeit with a custom bios and less features </s>
<s> i think you ll find most motherboards use the same materials and the markup on boards are for enthusiasts who are willing to pay a premium for gimmicks and the latest tech </s>
<s> the profit margins for higher end stuff are a lot larger than for the value mainstream market but that does not mean if it costs more it ll be more reliable </s>
<s> i read these forums regularly and don t see an extraordinary number of complaints or failures on hp machines regardless of platform </s>
<s> most of what i read here is people writing about upgrading the video card or ram in their hps </s>
<s> so what is your basis for saying their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> how many hps have you had </s>
<s> aren t a fair number of the hp motherboards made by asus </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> today your consumer machines are five year designs </s>
<s> once you get over that you understand you need to think of this as rent and act accordingly as well as maintain backups of what you can t lose </s>
<s> to go beyond 5 years we ll have to implement a maintenance system that the maker cycles parts out as they approach the usual mtbf hours </s>
<s> sadly this means the cost tends to go up about 10x of what you could spend with a normal replace a machine when it breaks cycle </s>
