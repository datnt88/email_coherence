<s> hey everyone </s>
<s> here s the deal </s>
<s> i have a 500gb wd passport essential </s>
<s> i had formatted it to ntfs right when i got it </s>
<s> it works fine with my vista laptop </s>
<s> but i now wish i could use it with more </s>
<s> i d like to be able to connect it to my ps3 and 360 to get media off of it and i use windows and mac both very much on a daily basis so i think i d like to convert to fat32 but before i do i d like to ask if this is a good idea </s>
<s> i ve heard things that fat32 doesn t accept files more than 4 gigs </s>
<s> also if i do go through with this how would i convert it </s>
<s> when i go to the format section of explorer the only options are ntfs and exfat </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> only way is to copy files off reformat then restore files </s>
<s> might want to rethink fat32 </s>
<s> with all the gadgets you re planning to connect to someday you ll crash the disk and lose all </s>
<s> get a flash to move your files around </s>
<s> i know i d have to reformat so that s not a problem </s>
<s> also i already have a flash drive but i would prefer the convience of just keeping everything on the one hard drive </s>
<s> is fat32 that bad </s>
<s> i mean it s the default format of the drive </s>
