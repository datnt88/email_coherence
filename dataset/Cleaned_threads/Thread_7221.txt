<s> hi i m wondering if the ati radeon hd7750 would be okay to use in an hp pavillion 6610f system with a 250w psu </s>
<s> i know a 400w supply is recommended for it but i ve read a few others opinions that say 250w would be fine because of the card s low power draw </s>
<s> i just want to make sure if it ll work or not before i consider buying a new psu </s>
<s> my system specs amd athlon ii x4 635 2 90ghz 4gb ddr3 750gb sataii 7200rpm dvd rw ati radeon hd 4200 graphics windows 7 64 bit 250w lite on ps 5251 08 12v 14a </s>
<s> power supply here s the one i installed it works just fine with light gaming digger </s>
<s> if the manufacturer recommends a 400w psu then get a 400w or better psu </s>
<s> don t find out the hard way you needed it </s>
<s> what you will find also users that have success with it installed as is </s>
<s> but they rarely tell you it failed at some given period </s>
<s> do as the maker recommends to be problem free on that issue </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks y all i decided to go with a corsair 500w and an hd7770 should be decent upgrade for now </s>
