<s> my dvi port on my gateway fdp2185 monitor built april 06 has gone bad </s>
<s> now i have to use the vga port and there is blurriness around text images look fantastic </s>
<s> native resolution 1680 x 1050 i have a nvdia 8600 gt dual dvi card with the latest driver </s>
<s> i m using the dvi vga adapter that came with this card </s>
<s> in xp sp3 i have changed the smooth edges from cleartype to standard and back again </s>
<s> cleartype looks better than standard but it is still blurry </s>
<s> is there a way to get clear text </s>
<s> this is my work computer and 90 of its use is completely text </s>
<s> i was told replacing the dvi port needs microsoldering and it is probably more cost effective to buy a new monitor </s>
<s> some 180 buck 22 quot refurb but it s hdmi and not dvi </s>
<s> here s a picture </s>
<s> that s connected with vga and to me is very sharp </s>
<s> maybe you just need to fix what broke or replace it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m fighting the urge to replace it with a dell 2408wfp </s>
<s> microsoft s cashback on ebay is not helping the urge either </s>
<s> 1 try another vga cable </s>
<s> 2 swap ends of the vga cable </s>
<s> 3 try other refresh rates start with 60 </s>
<s> i did change the vga cable and it made the text some clearer </s>
<s> i have to use the nvidia adapter because my 8600 only has dvi ports </s>
<s> i m going to get a dvi to vga cable to see if that completely clears it fingers crossed </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i don t have the option of changing the refresh from 60 </s>
