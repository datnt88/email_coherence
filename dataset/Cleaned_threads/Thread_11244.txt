<s> i got xp pro cd via an auction but no product key </s>
<s> if buying an coa license will that overcome the key requirement </s>
<s> i m getting conflicting info and wondering if to be legit the coa license is in fact just another key or just adding xp pro to another computer using the orginal key </s>
<s> tia willy </s>
<s> i will willingly let a person have a copy of my xp cd because it s useless without a proper activation code </s>
<s> i will not share my code and i registered mine to prevent theft of that code </s>
<s> so your answer will be found when you activate your xp </s>
<s> you won t have any choice in the matter as xp will cease to function in 28 days after the install </s>
<s> given all this headache i wonder if you will save any money when the dust settles and the aspirin bottle is empty </s>
<s> you can report a pirate if you get ripped off to piracy microsoft com bob </s>
<s> i got the xp pro from the goodwill i thought they re trying to pull a fast one </s>
<s> it appears to be an oem xp release </s>
<s> i can buy another xp pro oem release or the coa license which is quot suppose quot to be allowable to add xp to another system but as i said before i didn t get an answer to my question as i see it </s>
<s> basically i would save if coa but hassles i deal with all the time its just be my hassle </s>
<s> it appears i leaning to another oem purchase and use the auctioned cd as toolbox backup for files or whatnots </s>
<s> quot sigh quot thanks robert willy </s>
<s> i will not enter into any debate about any topical subject about activation </s>
<s> my only input to you is to proceed with care on oem versions since others have felt burnt over patches they can t get from microsoft or if the oem version locks onto the machine its installed on and won t budge to the next machine </s>
<s> since its an oem version microsoft is not your supplier and will not help you move the license to another machine </s>
<s> again contain any ire and spit over this since i m only trying to share that a few have been burnt </s>
<s> be sure your oem supplier will supply support in patches that you can t download </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you were illegally sold software you should go back to the seller and get your money back they effective stole it from you by selling you a worthless cd </s>
<s> this was brought at an auction quot as is quot so the buyer beware always applies </s>
<s> the sticker is probably stuck on some parted system somewhere </s>
<s> these are the chances one takes at such affairs but brother you can come out on top more often than not </s>
<s> i rarely ever get loaded systems but s w is sometimes part of a lot or load as it were you never know what you get </s>
<s> in this case i went for the xp as the hd i assumed wrongly would have the key nope </s>
