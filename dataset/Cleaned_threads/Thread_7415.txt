<s> i m anything but a networking guru but have always liked 3com products in that arena </s>
<s> they price above linksys netgear et </s>
<s> all but below cisco </s>
<s> i still have a box full of old 3com 3c905 nics harvested from older pcs that i still use when running into problems with other such devices </s>
<s> they just always work right from the get go </s>
<s> some of the ones i have actually say quot made in usa quot if you can believe that </s>
<s> some are made in ireland </s>
<s> my home network uses 3com office connect products which all stack neatly together </s>
<s> these include a router and wireless ap that never lock up though your mileage may vary </s>
<s> interestingly i have an hp office connect print server designed similarly to my 3com office connect products and stacks with these as well </s>
<s> i suspect 3com made the print server and maybe have partnered with hp in the past for networking products </s>
<s> 3com seems to have lost some popularity as home networking has exploded and lower priced networking products have taken over </s>
<s> hp makes decent printers but i know nothing about their procurve networking line just hope they won t steal 3com s name and turn out junk </s>
<s> buy it to enter the consumer space but to compete with cisco in enterprise </s>
<s> should be an interesting contest to watch </s>
<s> if you can help it money </s>
<s> don t buy consumer grade it products from any maker </s>
<s> buy their commercial small business enterprise stuff and you should be ok not fancy or pretty but functional and durable </s>
<s> i ve no formal training but have worked in electronics communications and medical devices as a hobby or for pay since i was old enough to rip apart an old tube type radio </s>
<s> in spare time now i provide support in a small school </s>
<s> while i love doing that i don t love spending too much time there </s>
<s> my wife is the tech coordinator there and we ve insisted that the school let us pick out hardware and vendors </s>
<s> this means custom built pcs with hardware of our choosing </s>
<s> i could build these myself but not as inexpensively and don t want to be responsible for warranty repair </s>
<s> for the school network i personally was involved in pulling all the cable wiring the cabinet and selecting switches and such </s>
<s> all are 3com including a poe switch for the 3com access points placed in the school </s>
<s> i ve never had a failure of a 3com device there and operation has been smooth and trouble free </s>
<s> that s how i like my volunteer job to go </s>
<s> we ve had our share of good hearted people wanting to donate their old pcs printers and such </s>
<s> most have been a headache and just something we need to find a nice way to thank them for the donation and discreetly dispose of their junk </s>
<s> i agree with you </s>
<s> start off with good quality stuff </s>
<s> your wallet may be lighter but you won t need to spend half your life in these forums trying to get your gear to work </s>
