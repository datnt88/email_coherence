<s> i have 2 harddrive questions 1 i have an external hard drive and although i am suppose to have a usb 2 0 connection no matter where i pull the cable it keeps telling me that the hard drive is not going to function as well and needs to be put in a usb 2 0 port </s>
<s> 2 i currently have a 80gb hard drive installed on my computer and when like to get and larger one installed </s>
<s> can they install a bigger hard drive say 250gb and transfer over all my stuff from the 80gb hard drive without causing any problems </s>
<s> 1 are you sure that your computer is usb 2 0 </s>
<s> make sure that you have tried this whith every port on your pc </s>
<s> your hard drive will work in usb 1 1 mode but transfer speeds will be dramatically lower </s>
<s> i m not joking </s>
<s> you will notice a huge difference with usb 2 0 it is possible that your computer is usb 2 0 compliant but for some reason is in usb 1 1 mode </s>
<s> if you are sure that your computer should be usb 2 0 but for some reason is not then email me at ranguvar13 gmail ocm i may be able to help more </s>
<s> 2 why not run both hard drives together </s>
<s> you can do that </s>
<s> you can keep your os on the 80gb one a nd use the larger one for most of your data that won t fit on the old one </s>
<s> can they install a bigger hard drive say 250gb and transfer over all my stuff from the 80gb hard drive without causing any problems </s>
<s> do you mean transfer everything as in windows or whatever you use apps games utilities etc </s>
<s> or do you mean just drag and drop data over </s>
<s> either way the answer is yes </s>
<s> if you want to copy everything though you will need a drive imaging app like symantec norton ghost </s>
<s> that program will read all the data on your 80 gb hard drive into a single file which can be then with ghost or whatever be uncompressed onto your new hard drive resulting in a perfect copy of everything </s>
<s> i hope i could help </s>
<s> about the usb 2 0 port you nead driver for usb 2 0 to be installd for it to work </s>
<s> about swaping disks the best thing is to by this program to make a copy of your c drive to the usb 2 0 drive and then pasting the imigefile to your new 250gb disk </s>
<s> after that you chang te 80 and the 250 on the cabels and log in to windows </s>
<s> when loggd in you go for the command promt and run cmd if you do it right you get a black window in it you type chkdsk c r and hit enter then answer yes to the question and reboot </s>
<s> after the reboot is doon you done </s>
<s> best regardes thomas persson it doktor </s>
<s> 1 you may have the usb ports set at 1 0 speed in the bios </s>
<s> this is unlikely but the only thing i could think of unless you only have 1 0 ports 2 yes use norton symantec ghost </s>
<s> are you 100 sure that the ports on the computer you have are usb 2 0 ports </s>
<s> what type model of computer is it that you have </s>
<s> is the 80 gig drive the drive on which your operating system is installed </s>
<s> if it is then you will need a some drive image software unless you want to reinstall the os and your applications </s>
<s> there are hardware and software compatibility issues with larger hd s so you need to tell us the make model of your computer </s>
<s> tell us what operating system you are using example windows xp with sp2 </s>
<s> 1 if your computer has only usb 1 1 ports install a pci usb 2 0 card </s>
<s> 2 you can keep your os on the 80gb drive and just install the 250gb hd as a secondary drive </s>
<s> if you want to move everything to the new hd the hd maker seagate western digital hitachi maxtor etc </s>
<s> provides a free utility to transfer the image of everything on the 80gb model to the new hd </s>
<s> note that the utility from a particular maker usually only works if you have one of their hd s installed </s>
<s> as far as the usb thing goes it sounds like your pc does not have usb 2 0 the larger hard drive could be a very easy thing though </s>
<s> just get the new hard drive and put it in the second bay of your computer </s>
<s> make sure that the hard drive is set to slave </s>
<s> then you will not have to go through all the work of mirroring the drive </s>
<s> you will still have the 80 gb drive just as it ws before but now you will also have the 250 gb drive </s>
<s> thats what i would do </s>
<s> since you already have the 80 gb drive why not use it too </s>
<s> more storage is more storage carl marx </s>
<s> my computer shows that i have a usb 2 0 port but its not reconizing it as being a high speed port </s>
<s> the people at gateway told me the i need a usb adapter </s>
<s> it is possible for the usb ports to work but be defective as not to work as a 2 0 port </s>
<s> also i think i will just add another hard drive </s>
<s> i do have a usb 2 0 port but for some reason my external hard drive doesn t reconize it </s>
<s> my brother doesn t have this problem when he uses the hard drive with his computer </s>
<s> whats the best way to check if i do indeed have a usb 2 0 port </s>
