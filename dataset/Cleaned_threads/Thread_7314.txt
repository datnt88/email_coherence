<s> i have seen several places selling 512 mb ram online </s>
<s> one is selling 2 256 mb sticks for a cheaper price </s>
<s> are there any cons to buying x2 256 mb rather than x1 512 mb besides the consideration of a future upgrade </s>
<s> i only buy stuff from newegg com the 2x256 is just 1 cheaper look here and here so i d get the 1 stick of 512 so that i could later upgrade to 1gb </s>
<s> or just buy 1gb right now </s>
<s> get the 1gb as 2 sticks of 512 so that you can have dual channel </s>
<s> dual channel memory architecture your system can only reach max performance with dimms of equal capacity in pairs in the same channel </s>
<s> bottom line you can use one 512 dimm vice two 256 dimms but doing so sacrifices performance </s>
<s> the other thing is get all the ram you intend to use on your system upfront then later you won t face the problem of removing low density ram to add higher density ram or finding ram the works reliably with the old ram </s>
