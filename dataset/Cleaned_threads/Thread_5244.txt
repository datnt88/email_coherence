<s> hi i just built a new comp </s>
<s> from the ground up and for some reason the onboard lan will not connect to my isp perhaps the isp won t recognize it not sure </s>
<s> i have the new comp </s>
<s> sitting right next to the old one </s>
<s> with the cable in the old one windows xp dell dimension there is no problem the dsl connects fine ip address auto detected smooth as you like </s>
<s> the isp assigns this comp </s>
<s> a fixed ip address always the same </s>
<s> but the new computer windows xp gigabyte ga 8n sli royal motherboard with dual onboard lan marvell 8053 chip marvell 88e1111 phy won t connect </s>
<s> the best i can get with autodetect is quot the network did not assign a network address quot repair doesn t work </s>
<s> manually entering the old computer s ip dns settings doesn t work pinging the server doesn t work </s>
<s> so what do i do </s>
<s> is it a problem with the isp refusing to recognize this new device if so how does it know that anyway </s>
<s> do i need to get them to change their settings to allow this new comp </s>
<s> to connect </s>
<s> or is the lan broken </s>
<s> still scratching my head </s>
<s> where s the router or such </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> turn of the modem and wait for 30 minutes or more to release the mac address lease or you can call your isp everytime you change your computer network adaptor </s>
