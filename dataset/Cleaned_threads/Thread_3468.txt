<s> i checked and no current thread seems to address this issue </s>
<s> in less than a year i had a seagate 500 gb 3 5 quot drive fail </s>
<s> it wasn t a hardware fault it was the controller board </s>
<s> the drive was being used externally and naked so ventilation was not an issue </s>
<s> ironically the failure happened while it was holding three other disc images while those discs were being reformated for new systems and recovery software doesn t like ntfs </s>
<s> once it was replaced i salvaged what i could from the other drives and having a network was able to rebuild much information from other machines </s>
<s> video files </s>
<s> who cares i can always rip them again </s>
<s> now a western digital 1 tb drive has done exactly the same thing again losing a laptop image during a rebuild and again it s the controller board </s>
<s> i know that mechanical tolerances are very tight on these drives but it wasn t mechanical failure it was the logic board </s>
<s> having drives that have remained stable for more than 10 years i know they re only supposed to hold out for five it leaves me stunned that neither of these drives lasted one year </s>
<s> i also know that the quality of differing brands comes and goes quantum used to build drives that could be dropped 1m 3 feet while running without sustaining any damage </s>
<s> that s not the case any more </s>
<s> fujitsu had the brilliant idea of introducing glass platters so that a headcrash scratched the glass not the data great idea except that they suffered from platter shatter when cranked up to speed </s>
<s> i have other seagate drives that have way outlived their usefulness and are still running fine and i m sure there are a couple of wdw in the pile as well </s>
<s> can other people advise from their experience which of the current brands models on the market have a proven customer experience reliability factor rather than just the manufacturer specs </s>
<s> this means multiple power on off cycles when being moved around for backup restore purposes and the ability to run quot server style quot for lt 2 years without power down </s>
<s> or am i seriously better off buying 1 dozen 100 gb drives raiding them and copping a huge electricity bill </s>
<s> while manufacturer s warrant drives with 3 or 5 year pro rated replacement your comment about naked and ventilation amused me </s>
<s> i use an hp cto with seagate st31000528as 3 year warranty drive </s>
<s> it has been quot on quot for 2 years now 24 7 </s>
<s> i do ulitize seagate disk wizard to clone the drive every 2 3 monthes to three matching st31000528as drives rotating them </s>
<s> no problem with the drives </s>
<s> my means of cloning involves an esata docking station made by azio </s>
<s> although the drive is exposed i still mounted a 4 quot fan shroud at 6vdc 100ma to cool the drive </s>
<s> that was because i noticed the drive was hotter during continued writes over 20 minutes </s>
<s> the reduced voltage allows me to have the docking station on my computer desk and not have to listen to the fan roar </s>
<s> certain seagate 7200 10 and 7200 11 drives did have a bad rep for failing but if logic boards from two different vendors are crapping out it s probably due to a power supply with poor voltage regulation on the 5v or 12v rails </s>
<s> as for drive reliability i prefer wd drives and have 4 2x640gb and 2x250gb in a home server that s been on 24x7 since early 2008 during the summer the ambient temp hits a very warm 82c and the drives are just fine </s>
<s> prior to that i had a 4x250gb setup since mid 2006 so two of those 250gb drives have hit the 4 year mark </s>
<s> rather than raid 5 a dozen drives together just mirror raid 1 two big drives </s>
<s> in relation to both drives the logic board was on top so that it could radiate any heat rather build up under the drive chamber </s>
<s> as it is mid winter here and the house temperature hasn t broken 20c in three months heat is an extremely unlikely factor </s>
<s> as a result of the first failure gimmicky quot independent quot supplies were replaced with a common xt power supply shared by both drives </s>
<s> the main use of both drives has been archiving dvds for speedier access and a weekly backup to the 1tb drive </s>
<s> as cited previously everything was fine until i relied on that backup to restore the laptop to which it s connected </s>
<s> previously the 500gb drive failed in exactly the same circumstances and i don t believe in co incidence </s>
