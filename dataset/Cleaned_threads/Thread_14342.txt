<s> hello all need your help in getting things right </s>
<s> my machine is using quot intel desktop board d101ggc quot motherboard i am interested in getting a sound card hopefully quot creative pci express sound blaster x fi titanium quot would this fit in to my pc </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> i meant card and not case </s>
<s> do pcie 1x cards work in pcie x16 or 2 0 slots </s>
<s> but this is not a good idea since you use up the pcie slot for something nicer for the video </s>
<s> i would not do this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but then the motherboard details mention that i have quot pci express x1 quot slot available </s>
<s> can t i use that one </s>
<s> intel makes quite a few variants so i went with the picture on your link </s>
<s> gt but you did your homework you have a x1 card and a x1 slot </s>
<s> why would you ask if they belong to each other </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> when it comes to motherboard and naming conventions i get confused </s>
<s> the site read quot expansion capabilities two pci conventional bus connectors one pci express x1 bus add in card connector quot but only after you said about x1 slot and x1 card my confusion ends </s>
<s> thanks bob for the super quick response </s>
<s> trying to get hold of a image of the pci slots to understand better </s>
<s> that mobo has one pci express x1 slot </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> why are you using a microatx mobo when you would probably be better off using an atx unless mobo size is an issue in your case </s>
<s> a regular atx card should provide you with at least 1 more pci slot for your sound card </s>
<s> under the lion s paw aslans </s>
