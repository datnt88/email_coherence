<s> thanks in advance for any help anyone could give me </s>
<s> i am on an older dell desktop that does not have high speed usb 2 0 a lot of the external hard drives i see have 2 0 in the name </s>
<s> for example a random google says quot toshiba s 400gb usb 2 0 external hard drive quot </s>
<s> does this mean it has to have a 2 0 drive to work </s>
<s> secondly i am almost exclusively going to be storing music on this hard drive as a means of moving around my growing music collection </s>
<s> will moving music onto the hard drive and possibly back onto another computer degrade the quality of the track </s>
<s> and lastly if anyone could make recommendation for a good external hard drive that will work for my needs and computer it would be much appreciated </s>
<s> i am running windows xp and service pack 2 not a terribly old computer by some standards it just does not have a 2 0 highspeed usb slot </s>
<s> thank you again for any help </s>
<s> the usb 2 0 refers to interface between the external enclosure and the host pc system not the hdd itself </s>
<s> might consider getting a usb 2 0 hi speed pci card for your dell to take greater advantage of the usb 2 0 speed 480kbps over the older usb speed 40kbps </s>
<s> the difference is significant even if you re not doing it for profit </s>
<s> just keep in mind it s never ever safe to keep the only copy of your family photos music or anything else you cannot afford to lose or easily replace on a single hard disk drive </s>
<s> it can die take a voltage spike or succumb to a virus in an instant </s>
<s> re recommendations if you buy retail a fully assembled external enclosure with a hard drive installed i recommend seagate or western digital </s>
<s> if you build your own buy an enclosure and a hard drive of choice i d pick seagate or western digital drive and a brand name quality enclosure </s>
<s> the difference most seagate and wd drive have 5 year and 3 year warranties respectively </s>
<s> most retail hdds i see have one year warranties </s>
<s> good luck vapcmd </s>
<s> thank you for the reply so from what i gather you are saying a 2 0 drive will work with my computer i will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds i could be if i had a 2 0 usb correct </s>
<s> my only other issue is the question about will storing music on an external hard drive degrade the quality of the music file if i was to move it between computers using the hard drive </s>
<s> from what i have read and gathered it does not but i just wanted to ask to be sure as these things are not my expertise </s>
<s> i planned to just copy my music folder onto an external drive for a bit of extra protection as my collection is becoming large </s>
<s> thank you once again for your insight </s>
<s> it s an exact copy like any copy of any file on any drive </s>
<s> so no loss of quality </s>

<s> quick answer quot yes quot but keep in mind mind quot usb quot is the interface standard between the external hdd enclosure and the pc it has nothing to do with the drive itself </s>
<s> even faster is the esata interface and for future use it s faster than usb 2 0 if possible get an external with usb 2 0 and esata </s>
