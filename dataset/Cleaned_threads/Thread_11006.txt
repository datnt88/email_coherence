<s> can someone tell me what s involved in replacing a currupted bios chip on a motherboard </s>
<s> is there any special tools that are needed </s>
<s> i have a soyo kt333 dragon plus motherboard that i tried to update the bios on and it has appeared to have failed </s>
<s> i can t get my system to boot up </s>
<s> i even tried resetting the bios using the reset jumper on the motherboard but this did not work </s>
<s> i have ordered a new bios chip from soyo </s>
<s> i m just wondering if this is something that i could probably do myself or if i m going to need to take it to a professional to do </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> if so all you need is that chip from the motherboard maker </s>
<s> my bet is it will cost about the same price as the entire board </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had a look at the manual for your board and it is a zif socket </s>
<s> this design is intended to make the bios quot switcheable quot whether you decide to make a go of this yourself is entirely up to you </s>
<s> if you feel you have the expertise to do it then i say try but be careful the pins on a bios chip are delicate </s>
<s> make for absolutely sure you re grounded </s>
<s> esd build up can turn your new chip into a really expensive little ornament </s>
<s> i can only assume as was stated in a previous reply that you opted to replace the chip as a less expensive alternative to replacing the board </s>
<s> if you have a socketed bios chip its pretty straight forward in its replacement </s>
<s> just remove with care and then ordinate new bios in its place </s>
<s> your manual or online gotted manual for your mtrbd </s>
<s> should explain the bios location </s>
<s> if you re unlucky you may have a quot soldered in quot bios chip and should be sent in to be replaced fixed not for the uncustomed </s>
<s> if soyo is senting a replacement it should be a socketed bios </s>
<s> you should check if the old bios supported quot boot strapping quot a very basic boot up routine to help recover via reflash the old bios or similar notation on the topic dig for it </s>
<s> enjoy willy </s>
<s> you say it s a zif socket </s>
<s> it sounds like it shouldn t be any harder than installing a processor </s>
<s> i opted to buy the bios replacement chip because i figured it would be cheaper and less of a hassle than replacing the whole motherboard </s>
<s> the bios chip cost me 20 plus shipping </s>
<s> with it being a zif socket i feel like this is something i can do myself </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> where did you find that it said it was a zif socket </s>
