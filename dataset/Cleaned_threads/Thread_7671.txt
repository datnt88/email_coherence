<s> from amazon just want to make sure this will work ok from my graphics card to my 1080i toshiba flatscreen </s>
<s> i wouldn t expect you to have any problems with that cable </s>
<s> the only hdmi cables i ve ever had any problems with have been the free ones i got from comcast </s>
<s> frys once had 6 hdmi cables on sale for 2 each and i bought 6 of them </s>
<s> not one of them has given me any problems </s>
<s> for 6 you aren t risking much to give it a shot </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> this cable will give me a better picture than my dvi cable is that true </s>
<s> dvi and hdmi signals are identical and digital </s>
<s> i ve never seen any change </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> than i won t waste the 6 </s>
<s> i know hdmi cables carry both sound and video and vga rgb cables carry video only </s>
<s> do dvi cables carry sound as well as video </s>
<s> since the dvi connections i ve seen come out of the graphics card i m inclined to doubt it </s>
<s> i have a vga cable right now and wonder if the hdmi would show a marked improvement digger </s>
<s> and i can t tell the difference </s>
<s> but i bet someone could if they tried hard enough </s>
<s> hdmi is however required for some setups </s>
<s> such as bluray playback </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i can t see a difference unless someone posts some specs for most i don t think there is </s>
<s> even if you use vga i m sure if you look closely see if an audio port is present as well many have that too just need the typical pc audio cable </s>
<s> my setup has it and i connect my laptop vga and audio to the tv </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
