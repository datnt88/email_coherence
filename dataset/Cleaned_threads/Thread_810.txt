<s> ok so i have a dvd box set that i stupidly ordered from a seller located in the uk </s>
<s> problem is that they are a different region as the us </s>
<s> this wouldn t be such a problem but it seems like everything is equipped with these lame region restrictions </s>
<s> the most problematic at this time is my dvd rw drive </s>
<s> apparently you can only change it s region a limited number of times and i have reached the limit </s>
<s> my question for all the geekier people out there than myself is what can i do to beat the region problem </s>
<s> below is link to a screen shot of the driver region status for the dvd rw which is basically saying i m screwed </s>
<s> btw i have a emachines t6410 i know it s lame any help or advice at all would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks paul </s>
<s> the drives are cheap </s>
<s> under 30 bucks for a nice sata dvdrw </s>
<s> cheaper than what they charge to reset the count </s>
<s> do you know of any particular drive or software that would allow me to view dvd s regularly from multiple regions without lowering my allowance of region changes </s>
<s> it has to do with a national agreement </s>
<s> you only find these in australia and other few countries </s>
<s> why is this a big issue at such a low cost part </s>
<s> well to most people 30 here and there is nothing but i m kind of broke </s>
<s> that s why i was looking for a permanent solution to the problem that would allow me to basically forget that there was a such thing as different region codes </s>
<s> it s an agreement made in most countries </s>
<s> as i must obey the local laws i can t comment on breaking said law </s>
