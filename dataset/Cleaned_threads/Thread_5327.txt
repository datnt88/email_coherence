<s> just one question what will you be backing up to </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i edited it here what do you mean backing it up </s>
<s> like os </s>
<s> data or your system if your only just hdd dies </s>
<s> now s a good time to plan for that contingency </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> so i should like buy 2 </s>
<s> hdd is strictly backup for the primary drive </s>
<s> in the event the primary drive dies i replace it and use the data from the backup on the 2nd hdd to restore a full working image to the new primary hdd </s>
<s> then i wipe the original drive and send it for warranty replacement </s>
<s> fast and easy </s>
<s> beats the heck out of finding all the installation discs the serial numbers reloading all the sw setting preferences etc makes me tired just thinking of it </s>
<s> vapcmd ps good choice on the ram </s>
