<s> hi everybody i have a two part question </s>
<s> i am going to college in the fall </s>
<s> i have an hp dv8t laptop and an hp photosmart c4780 all in one printer </s>
<s> as i am going to be in a dorm and since ink etc is so expensive i would like to limit the number of people who will be able to use the printer to me my roommate and a few others </s>
<s> i have been looking for a way to essentially password protect my printer it is wireless and will be connected to the network </s>
<s> the school has an internet network that is extended throughout the college so it is the only way to get intenet </s>
<s> here are my questions 1 can i password protect a printer on the campus wide network </s>
<s> 2 if not i heard you can make your own ad hoc network and password protect the printer on that but does that mean i would have to disconnect from the internet anytime i printed </s>
<s> 3 is there another way that i am missing </s>
<s> thanks any help would be greatly appreciated dan </s>
<s> 1 buy a usb cable to connect the printer to your laptop </s>
<s> 2 don t configure the printer to use the college wireless network see chapter 2 of the user manual how to configure it so just don t do that </s>
<s> then the printer can only be used from your laptop </s>
<s> 3 tell your buddies to use the guest account on your laptop and put the files they want to print on a usb stick </s>
<s> no need to use wireless connection here i think </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> yeah kees i totally agree the other thing make them chip in for ink sounds like they will be going through the stuff </s>
<s> also hope this is one tough printer as the saying goes too many cooks spoiled the soup in this case maybe the printer </s>
