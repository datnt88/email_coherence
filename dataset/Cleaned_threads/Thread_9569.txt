<s> hi got a friend s laptop that s 3 4 years old with win 7 first the keyboard stopped working </s>
<s> then apparently weird things started happening to it i asked suspecting the mb </s>
<s> then it now won t boot </s>
<s> it tries but doesn t succeed </s>
<s> cannot boot in safety mode either </s>
<s> reads the usb ports but cannot boot a bootable thumb drive </s>
<s> cannot boot from dvd either </s>
<s> changed the bios to accommodate those before the hd </s>
<s> pulled the hd and still can t boot from other media </s>
<s> in a remote area of india a jungle hard to get to town to buy stuff test etc </s>
<s> but from what i know of computers sure sounds like the mb to me </s>
<s> your thoughts or ideas </s>
<s> tia john </s>
<s> dollars to donuts that it s heat related </s>
<s> heat has probably weakened some part on it </s>
<s> keyboard may just have dirt or crumbs in it give it a good upside down shaking or vacuum it or none of that exist there use a straw and blow </s>
<s> when it fails to boot does it power off or just freeze while fan on cpu continues to blow </s>
<s> if you replace the laptop get something low power that can take a hot climate </s>
<s> india s a very big place </s>
<s> i live in the foothills of the himalayas </s>
<s> it s not hot here nor is it cold nor is it humid </s>
<s> i come from the caribbean and that was hotter and more humid and i haven t seen a problem like this before </s>
<s> no it doesn t freeze up nor power down </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> just what laptop model is this and how are you powering it or recharging </s>
<s> next be prepared for a teardown since being in a remote location you may have some issue if this isn t a quot robust laptop quot like in it can take it </s>
<s> typical laptops can only take so much and don t be surprised that it maybe insect related maybe </s>
<s> a teardown gives a close inspection of the innards and checks to see if any dust build up is truly removed </s>
<s> stopped or broken fans are common as well as dust build up even if blown out some dust clods may migrate deep into the cooling setup to include any vents </s>
<s> 3 4yrs </s>
<s> is plenty of time for all this to happen and let s not forget the battery if this is the original replace or have at least direct ac hook up and good power too </s>
<s> and yes having a good battery even during ac hook up makes a difference </s>
<s> try a quot live version quot of a bootable linux disc like ubuntu burnt properly it should be bootable </s>
<s> alas the dvd drive must be a good one to boot at all </s>
<s> test the bootable disc elsewhere </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> also there are so many optical drive failures in old laptops like this that i always find myself demoing how a good drive works </s>
<s> however did you try a bootable usb memory stick </s>
<s> i won t detail how since such is all over the internet </s>
<s> why i note this is that i have helped a few get onto some linux on usb and get some use out of their otherwise useless broken hardware </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so i tore it down again just to double check the dust </s>
<s> very little dust for such an old machine no bugs </s>
<s> fan worked fine </s>
<s> i hadn t tested that before because i didn t want to run it without the back cover but when i did she booted just fine </s>
<s> had to go back to a previous rebuild or whatever but she worked </s>
<s> then i shut her down put the back cover on and tried again no problemo </s>
<s> but why </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> and tear down build it again can get a contact to make contact and it works </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i specificity asked for details </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> because some models are prone to problems or early failure </s>
<s> you may have such a laptop and the problems will continue even though now it works </s>
<s> just keep that in mind since you really don t know why it works now </s>
<s> it s all a guessing game until you find the real cause of problem s </s>
<s> regardless a 3 4yr </s>
<s> old laptop should have some issues because after 18mos </s>
<s> the battery alone should be replaced because in some models heat build up due to constant recharging and or less than sustained levels aren t always precise and cause that charging ckt </s>
<s> to breakdown or cause weird results to include battery as well </s>
<s> if the battery had been replaced some time back was it from a good source rebuilds aren t always reliable or trusted </s>
<s> as for operation of laptop now working don t exclude quot corrosion quot or minor contact areas </s>
<s> these can be easily reconnected by simply reseating and breaking to new contact surfaces micro scratches to make good contact however this doesn t exclude bad wire harness or seating </s>
<s> makes ure on harness they re quot locked in quot even though it may appear so </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> good advice </s>
<s> john </s>
