<s> terabytes of nas are great for backing up lots of stand alone pcs on the network but what about backing up the nas </s>
<s> say i m using the mybook with it s vast storage for a central network data warehouse </s>
<s> raid will help with redundancy inside the mybook box so if one drive fails the other will have a copy of the data </s>
<s> but what happens if the whole wd mybook unit burns in a fire </s>
<s> i need another unit just like it somewhere else </s>
<s> but terabytes of data don t transfer quickly on a 100mb network </s>
<s> do you have a suggestion for how to maintain a replica of this huge drive somewhere else </s>
<s> quot terabytes of data don t transfer quickly on a 100mb network quot there is really no need to transfer such quickly </s>
<s> what matters is that whatever you do it should withstand and be able to help you recover from the disaster you plan for </s>
<s> that is if your building goes down in flames is whisked away by hurricane or is submerged by flood whatever you do withstands those disasters </s>
<s> many forget the disaster plan </s>
<s> this means that at some point you have to consider off site storage of what you can t lose </s>

<s> good points but what is the solution to large backups on a relatively slow backbone network </s>
<s> if the hardware only supports transfers of 5mb sec 40mbps you re looking at 18gb hr 432gb day not exactly zipping along and certainly not enough to backup a tb drive every night </s>
<s> am i thinking about this wrong </s>
<s> is there technology that helps </s>
<s> differential backups maybe </s>
<s> but you still need full archives from time to time eh </s>
<s> help </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it will eventually get there </s>
<s> it s not as if you are creating 1tb a day so your sync or backup program should someday catch up </s>
<s> look at syncback for example </s>
<s> it will only transfer the changed files </s>
