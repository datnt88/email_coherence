<s> i just did some research on the intel website regarding my intel pentium 4 processor number 519 which comes with the emachines t5026 </s>
<s> it said that hyper threading was turned off for this processor </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> does anyone know how i can turn the hyper threading on or do i need a new motherboard </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> quot intel pentium 4 processor 519 with 533mhz frontside bus 1mb l2 cache and 3 06ghz processor speed quot in the t5026 </s>
<s> that s not the ht cpu </s>
<s> the ht cpus have the 800mhz bus from what i see at intel com bob </s>
<s> bob is right on about this </s>
<s> 800 is the min fsb for intel to put on ht </s>
<s> check it out here z </s>
<s> this is were i got my information from </s>
<s> if you read in the notes section it says hyper threading is turned off i thought it could be turned on </s>
<s> but it is probably turned off due to the 533mhz fsb </s>
<s> thanks anyway </s>
<s> i have the intel desktop board d915gvwb would this board support a pentium 4 hyper threading cpu or better yet maybe one of intels new 6xx cpu for 64bit compatibility </s>
<s> maybe i should just swap out the motherboard for a aftermarket motherboard with a new cpu </s>
<s> what 3rd party motherboard would fit inside my emachines t5026 case </s>
<s> thanks again for all the help </s>
<s> the cpu you have is not the ht variety </s>
<s> shows this board to have the needed cpu support but this move is going to be expensive as you ll need new ram as well as the cpu </s>
<s> i wouldn t do this with the 64 bit wave approaching </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i can see where you may have thought your pc could have ht by looking at this link indicating ht tech suported the 533mhz system bus 3 06mhz </s>
<s> however scrolling down your 915gv chipset is not listed as one of those with ht </s>
<s> they list these intel desktop chipsets with 533 400 mhz as having ht 910gl 865p 850e 845pe 845ge 845gv 845e 845g i also note your pent 4 processor number 519 is not listed with those that have ht support </s>
<s> my brother has this computer which basically makes it half mine as its in my house </s>
<s> i plan to upgrade the motherboard processor and ram when the dual core pentium d comes out </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> it looks like to me either this cpu number 519 is no longer in production right now or is a special cpu made just for emachines with a lower fsb </s>
<s> it seems as all the socket lga775 are 800fsb when mine is only 533mhz </s>
<s> and the lowest cpu number i can see is 520 looks like i ll need a new cpu motherboard and ram by 2006 </s>
