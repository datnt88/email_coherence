<s> alright i have 2 questions but i thought it better being as how they are sort of related </s>
<s> the first is about dual monitors more specifically would they work on my machine and how </s>
<s> my graphics card is a nvidia geforce 560 ti i can t see anywhere else where i could connect the second monitor though is there any other information you need to know or is that it </s>
<s> second is another connectivity quesiton i want to upgrade my headphones and really like the look of being a gamer and a musician enthusiast the razer tiamat 7 1 i just want to know if they will also work on my computer what sort of connection do i need </s>
<s> how many input jacks </s>
<s> any help on either of these is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i can t see which one you have so i can t check if you can plug in a second monitor </s>
<s> also i can t find what monitors you have </s>
<s> as to the headphone i see it requires a 7 1 soundcard </s>
<s> so until we see if your pc has such a card i have to write it s a no go </s>

<s> the pc is bought from mesh computers online it said when i purchased it that it had intergrated 7 1 surround sound i m not sure if this is suitable or not and is there any images of the types of connection i would need for both screen and headphones </s>
<s> it would be a little difficult to get a decent image of the back of my pc atm thanks for the quick reply by the way </s>
<s> but no </s>
<s> i can t see any added detail in your reply i can use </s>
<s> if mesh says it has 7 1 then it s up to you to check that out </s>
<s> i can t do this for you given the lack of detail </s>
<s> the link i gave did supply other cards if the unit mesh used is not up to the task </s>
