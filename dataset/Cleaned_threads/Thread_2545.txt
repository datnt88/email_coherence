<s> my computer turns on but the monitor will not turn on </s>
<s> the keyboard flashes randomly and the harddrive does not turn on </s>
<s> but if i unplug it from the mb it will turn on with just power from the power supply </s>
<s> the green light is lite on the mother board and the fans are working </s>
<s> i im thinking its the motherboard or its a virus </s>
<s> i tried taking out the video card and puting it directly to the mb still didnt work </s>
<s> my computer is a 1 8 p4 cpu with a intel desktop board 512 ddr and 256 gforge video card and 160 gig harddrive </s>
<s> cause the problems you describe </s>
<s> well i was playing a game when the computer shut off earlier that day </s>
<s> when it shut off the power would turn on and off really quick so i decided to unplug it </s>
<s> the fan from the power supply was making a real loud noise for the past few days proior to it crashing </s>
<s> so i thought it was the power supply so i ship a new tower with a 450 wat power supply and had it tested before it got shiped </s>
<s> i put the computer together correctly checked at least 20 times to make sure </s>
<s> the computer turned on but the monitor didnt and keyboard flashes like before </s>
<s> here s the rub if your psu failed or is weak and starting to fail it may take other componets with it </s>
<s> or in the same vein degrade so much that when the psu is replaced its too late the other componets are weak and probably fall down </s>
<s> in your case the unplugging of the ac cord allows the start ckt </s>
<s> to de energize and makes relays truly turn off thus then power is applied and power on started it energizes and system starts a boot up however those same relays are weak and won t work properly when restarted unless repeated attempts or not </s>
<s> the logic ckt </s>
<s> that applies here has failed </s>
<s> you replaced the primary fault psu but secondary problems arise and in some may cause the new psu to fail as well its a domino effect at times </s>
<s> sorry tada willy </s>
