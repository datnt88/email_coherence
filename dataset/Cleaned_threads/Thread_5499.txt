<s> i m building a new computer and am not sure which motherboard to get </s>
<s> i m going to be getting an amd x2 4200 or 4400 not sure yet on am2 or socket 939 any suggestions on that </s>
<s> i assume the am2 is newer so if the opportunity is there to get one for am2 should i jump on it </s>
<s> anyway i know this would have to be 2 different reccomendations since i m not sure on the socket </s>
<s> i will also be purchasing an ati x1900 graphics card and a hauppauge 500 dualtv tuner </s>
<s> i saw a couple asus motherboards that received very high reviews but i saw it talk about sli which i figure i would not use since i have an ati graphics card and won t be putting 2 in my machine </s>
<s> one of the cards i was looking at was the a8n sli deluxe which received very good reviews </s>
<s> another was the asus a8r32 mvp deluxe but i know someone that has had a lot of problems with it </s>
<s> any reccomendations would be great thanks j </s>
<s> i m not really compelled to jump on the am2 bandwagon it s not a giant leap over 939 it s a babystep to ddr2 </s>
<s> the next big thing for amd will be k8l in 2007 which isn t too far away </s>
<s> as far as a 939 board the dfi lanparty nf4 ultrad overclocks exceptionally well but only if you have a good idea of what you re doing or if you get good advice from someone that knows what they re doing </s>
<s> if you want to overclock but you re not too familiar with how to go about doing it abit has some really good boards that you should look in to i have an at8 </s>
<s> they feature the uguru overclocking utility it s an easy way to get a good oc </s>
<s> one of the great things about abit is the support that you get at their forums from other abit users </s>
<s> re processor if you re waiting for the price drop in a week or two go for it </s>
<s> if you were planning on spending somewhere around 400 do yourself a favor and get an opteron 165 or 170 instead </s>
<s> they work with any board that supports dual core 939s </s>
<s> i m just looking into this stuff what new chip is coming out in a few weeks causing the price drop </s>
<s> end of july we talkin </s>
<s> ok i just got back into looking at things and thought that am2 was going to be the new standard either way i thought it was better than 939 i m not interested in overclocking right away atleast possibly down the road </s>
<s> ill check with abit as well as asus </s>
<s> i really want a highly rated board </s>
<s> what is the difference between an opteron and the other chip i was looking at like the 4200 manchester or windsor </s>
<s> a lot better chip </s>
<s> will i notice a performance difference </s>
<s> i don t know anything about them compared to the ones i was looking at </s>
<s> i see price wise it s just about the same </s>
<s> i appreciate the help thanks j </s>
<s> is the new chip code named conroe i believe </s>
<s> woodcrest is the server version that competes with opteron if you are curious </s>
<s> woodcrest is the new intel xeon processors </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> based on early benchmarks am2 offers 3 4 performance increase over 939 i believe </s>
<s> i was in the same position as you looking at a 4200 or 4400 x2 but ended up going with a 170 based on the user reviews </s>
<s> the main difference </s>
<s> most chips are produced with a certain high level of performance in mind </s>
<s> towards the end of production they re binned they test each one knowing that there will be variances in performance out of the same batch of cpus some will end up being 300 cpus some will end up 1000 cpus </s>
<s> opterons are some of the better performing and most sturdy server class </s>
<s> they re selected with the premise that they ll be on running 100 load 24 7 365 for years and it s possibly because of this that they oc so incredibly well </s>
<s> okay 4200 4400 opty 170 difference between the 4200 and the 4400 is the l2 cache twice the size in the 4400 the optys all have that larger l2 cache but the clock multiplier is lower </s>
<s> both the 4200 4400 have an 11x multi core clock x multi cpu speed in this case 200mhz x 11 2200mhz 2 2ghz the 170 has a 10x multi the 165 a 9x multi with the same stock 200mhz core clock speed but they oc well you can increase that significantly </s>
<s> i normally run my 170 24 7 at 260 x 10 2 6ghz or fx60 speed although i can run it a little higher </s>
<s> some people run em at 280 10 some 300 10 some higher let s put it this way if you don t get it to run 260 10 something s not right </s>
<s> so how long will it be for these chips to fall in price </s>
<s> id figure the drop would be substantial is there a new chip coming out at the end of the month </s>
<s> so i assume you are saying that this trip would run better than the 4200 or 4000 x2 </s>
<s> if i do get it is there a motherboard i should look for that would work well with it </s>
<s> also any reccomendations on memory </s>
<s> i wanted to get 2gb </s>
<s> thanks j </s>
<s> that s the dilemma for you it s not likely that the opterons will drop in price they re not technically consumer chips and the opteron division is healthy no reason for them to cut prices </s>
<s> the x2s will be dropping by up to 50 in the next couple of weeks in anticipation of competition with intel s conroes </s>
<s> they next motherboard that i will buy for a 939 will be the dfi lanparty nf4 ultra </s>
<s> pair that with an opteron 165 or 170 with 2gigs ocz pc4000 ram and you ll likely hit 300 x 9 or 10 2 7 3 0 ghz with the proper settings </s>
<s> so you have to decide go with an x2 in the 200 region or spend another 150 200 on a chip that has the potential for 3 0 ghz </s>
<s> i m new to overclocking </s>
<s> if i do decide to go that route and get the opteron and that board to overclock it is it easy to do </s>
<s> is there somewhere i can go that would guide me through it </s>
<s> it d definitely something i would do assuming i wouldn t be damaging any of my new parts or decreasing their longevity </s>
<s> i would assume i would need to buy new fans in order to overclock it is that right </s>
<s> intel conroe will come out very high in price i would assume so it s probably not something i d be interested in looking for i might just go this route </s>
<s> i appreciate all of your help so far thank you very much j </s>
<s> it s not too tough it just takes patience and having someone very knowledgeable goes a long way </s>
<s> i got some good advice from the guys at the abit forums but what really opened it up was the advice i got after joining the abit wolves fold home team </s>
<s> you don t necessarily need to have an abit board to join we have our own forums with restricted sections for members </s>
<s> there are several very knowledgeable guys that you can ask any number of questions from selecting components to ram settings to voltages </s>
<s> there s always a risk with overclocking but the more you know the more you can manage it </s>
<s> temps and voltage are the things that you really want to keep an eye on if they get out of hand it ll shorten the lifespan of your equipment that s why i usually run at 260 10 because it s the highest i cane run without bumping the voltage from the stock range </s>
<s> it can certainly be run higher with a little more voltage and still be in the low risk range but my cpu is always at 100 load and i never turn my rig off as far as cpu cooling the stock coolers with the opterons are actually pretty good it s a 4 heat pipe design </s>
<s> if you want to cool things down a little more there s the zalman cpns 9500 it s one of the better aircoolers out there </s>
