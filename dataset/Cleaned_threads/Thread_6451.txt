<s> i m looking to buy a new gaming pc in the next couple months and am currently looking at this one here as far as high performance gaming goes is this gonna perform well </s>
<s> the highest spec game i ll be playing is probably gta iv and then just older ones like half life 2 thanks in advance for any help </s>
<s> the geforce 9800gt is a staple of the usual gamer </s>
<s> you can research all the parts but what you are looking at is the garden variety gamer machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok well i m not into anything too fancy so that sounds good to me </s>
<s> so this sort of computer will be able to run my games no problems </s>
<s> not necessarily on highest resolution or anything just nice smooth gameplay </s>
<s> but to say that games windows would not have problems is something i can t bring myself to write </s>
