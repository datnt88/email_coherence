<s> a friend called me up from texas asking for help his floppy disk has changed to read only </s>
<s> i assume he has winxp but that s all i know </s>
<s> read only tab </s>
<s> it s on the corner of the floppy case </s>
<s> open the file s in explorer click properties uncheck the read only button </s>
<s> my friend has this to say i have tried many things but no results </s>
<s> the latest is to select the flopy click quot properties quot and at the bottom of the page i see three boxes as follows read only quot hidden quot and quot archives quot </s>
<s> usualy the read only is check so i clear that and try the other two attributes or none </s>
<s> an quot apply quot box appears and i check that but nothing changes </s>
<s> do you know how i can get rid of the quot read only </s>
<s> do a google or microsoft search on quot take ownership quot </s>
