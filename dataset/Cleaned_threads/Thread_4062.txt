<s> my new graphic card should fit in the agp 4x slot even though its agp8x i heard its compatible but the metal bracket that surrounds the dvi s video plug is too small i think my new one has a low profile bracket and my current one has a full height bracket but i cant switch the brackets because my current graphic card uses one vga connecter while the new one uses a dvi and s video connector i have a converter for that but the bracket is still an issue </s>
<s> i was thinking maybe i should remove the low profile bracket of of the new graphic card and use aluminum foil so the graphic card wont be hanging out and leave a hole for dust to enter into will that work </s>
<s> or is there anything else other than buying a new graphic card that i can do </s>
<s> i think the risk of a piece causing a short is so high that i d make one of plastic </s>
<s> as to dust no pc i know is dust proof so that s an odd thought </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so is using plastic better than using aluminum foil because i thought that plastic would melt but if its plastic i should use than i can find some easy to cut plastic around maybe a binder or something like that </s>
<s> that means we are well past the danger zone of the chips frying </s>
<s> that s hot </s>
<s> wait i haven t tried using plastic i was asking if it would be better to use than aluminum foil and i was just predicting that it will get hot and melt but i don t actually now if it will melt or not </s>
<s> the computer we have shouldn t get that hot anyways so should i use plastic replace the metal bracket that is too small </s>
<s> plastic gives anyone a shot at getting it done </s>
<s> metal any type comes with quot extra skill required quot but foil gives me a bad feeling as it could fall into the machine </s>
<s> yes i ve headed to the shop to make a new custom bracket when needed </s>
<s> it s just sheet metal so tin snips and a drill press then some creative bending was all that was ever needed </s>
<s> plastic could be the easy and safe fix </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i do agree with all you said and since i don t have that much skill in using drills i wouldnt want to mess anything up so i ll just use plastic thanks for answering my questions </s>
