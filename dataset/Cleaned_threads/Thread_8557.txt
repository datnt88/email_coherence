<s> what is a cross over cable </s>
<s> how is it different from a normal cable e g </s>
<s> cat5 or rj45 and when is it used </s>
<s> and what are quot twists quot in the cable and how does these twists quot qualify quot the cable </s>
<s> all these with regard to connection of networking devices e g </s>
<s> nic modem router etc </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> christy </s>
<s> you have to envision the ports used by ethernet </s>
<s> like devices pc to pc have the transmit pair and receive pair on the same pins on the cable </s>
<s> unlike devices pc to router have the transmit and receive on different pins </s>
<s> a crossover cable is used for like devices </s>
<s> pc to modem or router or networked printer use a standard cable </s>
<s> twists involve self induction and mutual induction of the apparent frequency of a digital signal </s>
<s> more twists mean less loss on higher frequencies </s>
<s> a simple example of apparent frequency and digital bit rate can be explained with a t 1 signal of 1 544 mb s </s>
<s> the apparent frequency of an quot all 1 s quot signal is 772 khz </s>
<s> check this link hope it will help </s>
