<s> i believe it is a mobo issue </s>
<s> motherboard is a msi pm8m v chip is a celerond 2 93 ghz have installed 512mb ultra ram pc 3200 have tried numerous cdroms by different makers </s>
<s> first try to install xp pro i m advised in a blue screen of death that the acpi button is not comliant and i should update the bios </s>
<s> 1 i have updated the bios from version 2 0 to 2 2 i used the manufacurer s website and am sure i have used the correct drivers </s>
<s> 2 i also disabled the acpi options in the bios </s>
<s> i ve disabled all the onboard items tried moving midway through the d files the installation slows to a crawl and the installation program claims it cannot find file driver cab </s>
<s> if i try again it will not be able to find another file in the same section </s>
<s> 3 i have tried different cd rom drives to get around this issue </s>
<s> it always crashes about the same place </s>
<s> 4 i ve tried different installation disks and different operating systems types </s>
<s> no luck </s>
<s> even my knoppix linux on cd cd hangs </s>
<s> 5 i ve moved cables the ram reset the bios tried diffrent parts </s>
<s> nothig is working </s>
<s> basically my bag of tricks is empty </s>
<s> the bios posts just fine i just can t get any os to isntall </s>
<s> any ideas out there </s>
<s> could be power supply rating bad ram bad board bad cpu </s>
<s> the hard disk is unlikely since knoppix is a cd boot </s>
<s> time to call the maker up and ask what parts they want to exchange </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for confirming my opinion </s>
<s> i ve called the seller and will be exchanging the mobo </s>
<s> i m just not looking forward to tearing it all apart </s>
<s> such is life </s>
<s> thank you again for your time </s>
<s> it s an overlooked component </s>
<s> some try something they had laying around or think quot 350 watts should be plenty quot bob </s>
<s> i m not sure of the brand i m not at work right now </s>
<s> i doubt it was a name brand </s>
<s> i did try another different stick of ram and got knoppix to load but not xp </s>
<s> thing is the overzealous person in purchasing immediately took the upc s for the cpu and ram to send in for the rebates </s>
<s> she did this while i was away from my desk and had them mailed before i knew what she had done </s>
<s> grrr </s>
<s> so i can t return the ram or the cpu even if i wanted to </s>
<s> i would have asked her to wait until i was completely done </s>
<s> i ll try an alternate power supply first thing in the am </s>
<s> this is so weird i ve never had a mobo post but then not work right thanks again for all the advice you have know idea how much i value your time </s>
<s> the sign of failed boots is typical of the 350 and smaller psus </s>
<s> while those should be enough </s>
