<s> which of these ram configurations will give better performance </s>
<s> assume latency and speed cannot be changed case 1 two 1 gb rams ddr2 800 5 5 5 12 1 8v with each ram sold separately </s>
<s> or case 2 two 1 gb rams ddr2 800 5 5 5 12 1 8v with both rams sold in one package under the name quot dual channel quot my understanding is that as long as the motherboard is connected to two ram slots through two different bus and if the ram sticks have identical configuration then what we get is a quot dual channel quot ram system </s>
<s> so i am not sure if buying quot dual channel quot rams case 2 is better than buying two rams with identical configuration case 1 </s>
<s> can you please clarify </s>
<s> if i was going to buy one or the other </s>
<s> i d go for the pkg unless there is some big price diff </s>
<s> why the pkg gets me darn close to a matched pair same make model batch run etc </s>
<s> the intel motherboard p965 express chipset which i plan to buy comes with the following notice quot notice only ddr2 800 memory supporting jedec approved 1 8v operation with timings of 5 5 5 or 6 6 6 is supported on intel desktop boards based on intel 965 express chipsets quot click on spec tab in the dual channel package rams case 2 i found have 2 2v 4 4 4 12 latency and cost about 70 </s>
<s> since i could not find dual channel ram packs with 1 8v and 5 5 5 12 latency i was thinking of buying two individual identical rams which would meet the motherboard requirements </s>
<s> the two rams cost higher about 97 48 5 apiece i am afraid of using the dual channel rams since they require about 2 2v for their operation atleast that is what i think so whereas the motherboard would power them up only till 1 8v </s>
<s> if you think the dual channel rams would still work fine then i would be more than happy to go for them at 70 </s>
<s> this is why i usually buy my ram from crucial com never a worry </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> and they re very finicky </s>
<s> many quot high performance quot kits don t work in intel boards because they need the extra voltage </s>
<s> as for dual channel operation you could buy 2 dimms seperately but be sure to consider the shipping cost when comparing prices </s>
<s> here s a couple of kits 2x1gb that will work with your intel desktop board patriot 88 shipped g skill 90 shipped but if you re trying to economize and worried about compatibility just get ddr2 667 </s>
<s> crucial 75 shipped kingston 73 shipped </s>
<s> given a choice i always recommend getting the kits as they are usually made of chips from the same batches and should be matched </s>
<s> second recommend getting all the ram for the target pc in 2 dimms 2 1gb vice 4 dimms 4 512mbs </s>
<s> if you get one dimm now and one dimm 6 months from now it s unlikely they ll be exactly the same </s>
<s> whenever you buy ram test the ram with memtest86 as soon as you receive and install the new ram </s>
<s> by the way there s no such thing as dual channel memory there s only ram that works in systems with dual channel memory architecture </s>
