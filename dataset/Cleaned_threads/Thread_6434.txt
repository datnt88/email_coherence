<s> you have to use hp s latest driver offerings and if it s crashing call it in under support </s>
<s> be ready to wipe the machine and reload but stick with it </s>
<s> some get a new motherboard or such until it works </s>
<s> on the game forums others have hacked the nvidia drivers to let you use them on laptops </s>
<s> but i offer only this information and nothing more </s>

<s> thank you bob i have done a lot of things acording with hp suport from reparing and reinstalling the os last thing they suggested was to use an utility called active killdisk i have downloaded but it wont work since is the free version and would only do a zero phase erasing what would you suggest do you think this will work and is there another free utility that would do the same has killdisk </s>
