<s> i am looking to purchase a notebook for college </s>
<s> i m looking into a few offers for a solid work gaming machine </s>
<s> i have read reviews and looked at benchmarking tests that with the right memory ddr400 3200 </s>
<s> the 64 will perform better in games than a pent3 2 </s>
<s> my question </s>
<s> given the fact that games are always kicking up the system requirements will the 2 2ghz speed of the 64 chip itself act as a limiting factor or should i just consider total system performance better than 3 2ghz </s>
<s> you ve misread all the articles </s>
<s> let me toss them all away with this statement </s>
<s> gt laptops are not desktops </s>
<s> laptops are finely engineered units which you will not overclock or fiddle with </s>
<s> as to the 64 bit question i ve witnessed the transition in the quot workstation quot aka sun computers and others from 32 to 64 bit and the changeover was much faster than anyone expected </s>
<s> if you go with the athlon 64 you can run xp 64 now and the xp 32 bit sp2 will use its externsions as well </s>
<s> if you stick with 32 bit my best advice is to not overinvest and to think that you are buying a two year machine </s>

<s> thanks for the info </s>
<s> 64 bit looks even better now </s>
<s> now as for 32bit gaming </s>
<s> no overclocking since i m inquiring about the longevity of the actual processor </s>
<s> some top notch gaming laptops possess the athlon64 processor because it seems to handle 32 bit gaming very well easing the mem to chip bottleneck and utilizing a large on chip mem cache </s>
<s> well my question is simply this </s>
<s> will the limited 2 2ghz compared to 3 2ghz chip speed itself present a wall or is it less relevant considerig overall system performance with the amd </s>
<s> if you want to be truly confused look at the ghz of the centrino and non ht p4s </s>
<s> for rough comparisons the centrino at 1 2 the clock speed is as fast as the p4 at it s speed </s>
<s> see if you can find benchmarks on this </s>
<s> but for games 2 ghz of any cpu and 1 ghz centrino is usually more than ample </s>
<s> the real bottlenecks are the video card and possibly the hard disk </s>
