<s> ok first i am srry if i am posting in the wrong section because this is my first time on the cnet boards </s>
<s> i proble is as follows i have 1 80 gb hdd and 1 40 gb hdd </s>
<s> i want to make 3 total partions each 40gb for a seperate os install </s>
<s> if i use a boot loader can i still boot the the 2ed 40 gb hdd </s>
<s> or do all the partions need to be on the intial 80 gb hdd so i can boot to them </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> it does make a difference </s>
<s> also if you are willing to buy a boot manager or not </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will have 2 win xp pro copies 1 win server 2003 copy and maybe a linux unknown distro at this time down the road </s>
<s> as for buying the boot manager if is ts affordable under 50 60 american </s>
<s> in that case the xp and 2003 boot manager will be ok when you get a current linux distro a new boot manager most likely grub will handle the boot management </s>
<s> if you get some old linux distro then you have to deal with it </s>
