<s> i am posting a new question to the mac hardware forum concerning a new replacement for my original usb1 1 apple card for my mac g4 quicksilver server to a new card for the usb2 standard </s>
<s> my g4 has a single port for the usb </s>
<s> is the usb and the firewire port next to it connected to the same card </s>
<s> opened up to take a look at what is involved to replace the card unit and quickly closed the mac door </s>
<s> i am not an it person </s>
<s> way over my head </s>
<s> what should i do </s>
<s> also what usb2 hub should i purchase </s>
<s> 4 ports are not enough </s>
<s> i am interested in the belkin 7 port maybe </s>
<s> your thoughts </s>
<s> mr macfixit do you do house calls </s>
<s> thanks kevin smith </s>
<s> k it is very easy to equip your machine with usb 2 0 you can even do it yourself even though you are not a it person </s>
<s> first your g4 has 2 usb ports and 2 firewire ieee1394 ports </s>
<s> while you are upgrading the usb you might as well upgrade the firewire too </s>
<s> upgrades for usb and firewire are achieved by installing a pci card into your g4 </s>
<s> upgrading both at the same time involves no extra work on your part </s>
<s> you just buy a firewire usb 2 0 pci combo card </s>
<s> usb and firewire on the same card </s>
<s> you can find one such card here but there are others </s>
<s> gather up your new card still in the box and a phillips head screw driver </s>
<s> 2 should do </s>
<s> it would also be nice if you had a grounding wrist strap but it is not essential if you follow the instructions </s>
<s> to install the card shut down your g4 </s>
<s> if you have enough room to open the door where the machine is good </s>
<s> if you don t have room disconnect everything and move to somewhere more roomier preferably with a nearby grounded power outlet </s>
<s> plug the power back in </s>
<s> do not start the machine up </s>
<s> open the door and lay it down flat </s>
<s> put on the wrist strap and attach the other end to a metal part of the g4 </s>
<s> power supply case is good </s>
<s> do not attach the end directly to any part of the logic board </s>
<s> if you don t have an anti static wrist band make sure that you have everything close by touch the power supply case with one bare hand </s>
<s> unplug the power cord all static in your body has now been dissipated </s>
<s> pci cards are fitted in the white slots on the logic board motherboard </s>
<s> locate the slots </s>
<s> in your case they are probably all empty </s>
<s> notice on the back of the case in line with the white slots there are covers over the openings </s>
<s> the covers are held in place with one philips head screw </s>
<s> note how the covers are situated </s>
<s> pick a slot any slot and remove the cover from the corresponding opening in the case </s>
<s> keep the screw </s>
<s> remove the pci card from the box and the anti static bag </s>
<s> hold the card by the edges and avoid touching the components </s>
<s> look at the card the slot and the opening </s>
<s> the connector on the card goes into the slot the tongue of the card where the external connectors are goes between the logic board and the case </s>
<s> the whole thing sits down in exactly the way that the original opening cover was sat </s>
<s> it will be a fairly tight fit you may have to wiggle it a little but do not force it too much </s>
<s> when everything is lined up it will fit in </s>
<s> put the phillips screw back in </s>
<s> disconnect the wrist strap close the door reconnect everything and fire it up </s>
<s> it probably not require any drivers to make it work </s>
<s> os x panther has usb 2 0 support and firewire has been around for a long time </s>
<s> these and any other necessary instructions will be found in the booklet that comes with the card </s>
<s> ignore any language except english </s>
<s> ignore any instructions for any flavor of windows </s>
<s> read only the mac setion </s>
<s> this is a job for a non tech person who is willing to read and look before attacking the logic board </s>
<s> good luck p </s>
<s> mrmacfixit thank you for the help and understanding for a non it person </s>
<s> the post was easy to understand and to follow </s>
<s> the link was also a plus upgrading to a usb2 </s>
<s> i have printed this post out and also copied your text to a word doc </s>
<s> for filing on to my cnet folder and helpful posts </s>
<s> i keep a folder with helpful posts from you and others on my hard drive </s>
<s> you should be a technical writer </s>
<s> wonderful </s>
<s> your post is really easy to understand </s>
<s> what about becoming a moderator </s>
<s> i will post back to you with my results </s>
<s> your help is great </s>
<s> hopefully i will not blow up my mac or zapp it </s>
<s> wish me luck </s>
<s> i also think that this post will be worthwhile to many others seeking the same solution and how to do it </s>
<s> thanks for the tip on upgrading firewire at the same time </s>
<s> never thought of upgrading firewire while upgrading usb2 </s>
<s> who knew </s>
<s> not me </s>
<s> two great tips from you </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> kevin smith </s>
<s> p thanks for the link you saved me hours looking for the upgrade </s>
<s> probably would not have found it on my own </s>
<s> went directly to the site and ordered it for 49 95 </s>
<s> two day shipping was 11 95 </s>
<s> the only other shipping option was an overnite at 22 </s>
<s> received the secure package from fedex today </s>
<s> the sonnettech site will notify you on any updates available for the purchases that you have just made </s>
<s> nice idea </s>
<s> next step install </s>
<s> thanks again kevin </s>
