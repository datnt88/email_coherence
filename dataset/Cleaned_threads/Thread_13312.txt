<s> hi i m looking to put together a mid range to low high end workstation pc for my own use and i m trying to educate myself on what parts i should think about getting but i am stuck on the video card </s>
<s> geforce cards are way more affordable than the quadro fx cards i d like to stick with nvidia </s>
<s> in a perfect world i d like the performance of the quadro with the price of a geforce but to be honest i ve never used a quadro and wouldn t know how much of a difference it makes </s>
<s> would it make more sense to buy a high end geforce or a mid to entry range quadro </s>
<s> basically i want to build a pc that will be a great station for me to improve my skills with 3d softwares on mainly maya 3dmax </s>
<s> i use photoshop and painter as well but i m certain i won t have problems running those </s>
<s> i figure quadros are for professionals who are making money through 3d design so i wouldn t need a 1 600 quardo card but i m wondering if a lower end quadro would be better for learning on than a high end geforce </s>
<s> any help </s>
<s> geforces don t </s>
<s> probably 95 of the time a geforce will render exactly as a quadro with no issues </s>
<s> but sometimes you might encounter quirks or anamolies </s>
<s> nvidia will not address any quirk produced by geforce drivers in autocad maya etc </s>
<s> but it will address issues with quadro drivers </s>
<s> likewise most 3d app vendors test and certify quadro drivers to ensure they work without issues </s>
<s> the typical quirks can usually be worked around or avoided by changing resolution screen layout or just living with a display anamoly </s>
<s> a card like a 130 geforce gts 250 uses the exact same gpu as a quadro that s 4 times or more expensive </s>
<s> to me the bottom line is this if you make your living from your 3d apps then get a quadro </s>
<s> time is money and you don t want to futzing about with a video card issue when you re on a delivery deadline </s>
<s> missing it could cost you a lot more than the price of a quadro </s>
<s> but if you can live with an occassional quirk here or there and the occassional frustration then get a geforce </s>
