<s> i need a new computer </s>
<s> i have narrowed it to either the hp d4100e or the dell precision 380 both will have two hard drives for automatic data backup </s>
<s> i am customizing either way </s>
<s> mainly i am trying to decide on which product is more reliable </s>
<s> both will cost around 2000 the hp is a little cheaper </s>
<s> the good thing about dell is that they will send someone to my house to set up and transfer my data from my old computer to my new one </s>
<s> this is great </s>
<s> hp won t do this </s>
<s> i can t do it myself and it could cost a lot to hire someone </s>
<s> this accounts for the difference in price between the two computers around 200 for dell to have someone transfer data i had bought a gateway about 8 months ago but it did not work very well when i received it </s>
<s> kept dumping memory after a couple of weeks on the phone with gateway and a visit by their tech guy to my house i sent it back for a full refund </s>
<s> this was after their set up guy had spent four hours at my house transferring data </s>
<s> gateway ate the cost for this when the computer didn t work </s>
<s> so here i am still with the old slow computer </s>
<s> it is a dell dimension it has not been great but at least it is still standing </s>
<s> its problem is that it is slow and sometimes has error messages </s>
<s> dell told me four years ago not long after i bought it to wipe the hard drive and start over with putting in the operating system </s>
<s> i didn t do it due to the data transfer problem </s>
<s> it is windows millenium so what do i do </s>
<s> i also want to get a notebook </s>
<s> i like to use two computers at once </s>
<s> i have gotten spoiled doing research on one while writing on the other </s>
<s> i was thinking of getting the hp zv6000 notebook </s>
<s> i have been using an hp zv5000 for the past year it belongs to someone else and it has worked ok but it has to do nothing </s>
<s> it has hardly any data or programs on it so my experience may not really count </s>
<s> last any other suggestions for comptuers </s>
<s> although i really hate to start over now </s>
<s> i plan to get the desktop first then get a notebook in about a month </s>
<s> as for what i need i write a lot </s>
<s> i create and work my own websites </s>
<s> this is hundreds of pages </s>
<s> i have a lot of photos </s>
<s> i am taking a photoshop class now so plan to do more advanced photo work </s>
<s> i am thinking of getting into podcasting </s>
<s> i want two hard drives so i can automatically back up my data </s>
<s> i would die if i lost my files </s>
<s> a friend told me to get a sony but it is expensive and does not seem conducivve to customization </s>
<s> looking for wisdom </s>
<s> i cannot build a computer i can do nothing more than turn the thing on </s>
<s> thanks charlotte </s>
<s> i have sa4000t </s>
<s> pretty much same as d4100e </s>
<s> works good </s>
<s> i guess </s>
<s> but seems expensive even to building your own </s>
<s> my suggestion get a friend who enjoys building and won t charge you </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> i own one and they do not support their computers if you re not sure what you re doing don t suffer contradictory information at the hands of dell support </s>
<s> most of the people i know who own an hp are not complaining i don t really know what to suggest beyond a little observation about these things i don t know enough tech stuff to provide you with much more </s>
<s> buy a mac </s>
