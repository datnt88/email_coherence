<s> hi i just bought a samsung syncmaster 710n </s>
<s> everything with this monitor is quite satisfieing to me but there is a big problem it seems like windows 2000 sp4 actually has a big problem displaying things right through this monitor </s>
<s> i actually can not really believe that it is the monitor s problem because i tested it for 45 minutes in the shop before buying it but that was with a windows xp machine </s>
<s> it is hard to explain what it looks like for me mostly like low color quality </s>
<s> i made a shot of an icon to show you what i mean but i can not assure that what you see will be the same as what i see when i looked at an icon before installing this monitor it has not looked like a cheap gif it looked like a normal high quality icon </s>
<s> now this icon i have taken a shot of shows a lot of single pixels it looks raw it does simply not look like it should </s>
<s> i installed the samsung monitor driver i have reset the colors i have auto adjusted several times i have switched to other resolutions this tft s optimum is 1280x1024 and switched back again of course no change at all </s>
<s> some pictures look really bad </s>
<s> not like usual tft quality they look a bit pixelated </s>
<s> i launched unreal i and had a look at the direct3d performance same there strange pixelated graphics and partly unluminated surfaces i am really out of ideas solutions or whatever </s>
<s> i noticed this problem at a friend s place too quite the same tft some older samsung and windows 2000 please do not suggest me to upgrade to xp i will not do this </s>
<s> i am running 2000 on a notebook at work and everything is fine i know it is possible so please if you bring ideas let them be solutions because there must be one </s>
<s> thank you for reading and for any suggestions ideas solutions </s>
<s> cheers leo ps </s>
<s> you can also find information on this thread here </s>
<s> windows 2000 will install some drivers on initial install but windows update will not install drivers unless you configured it to do so </s>
<s> my initial question would be quot what color depth are you using </s>
<s> they should look good if you are using 16 bit or 32 bit color </s>
<s> it sounds like you are using 8 quot but you may need to fish around for the quot show icons using all possible colors quot setting </s>
<s> i m not on the 2000 box so i leave this for you to find </s>
<s> maybe tweakui could help with that or it s icon rebuild tool </s>
<s> as to drivers i may have missed what video card you have but as always try the latest </s>
<s> as to windows update i suggest you set it to not do drivers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have a 2000 installation running with a ibm tft monitor and a 4500 3dfx </s>
<s> finding drivers for the 2000 installation was difficult as the card is out of support </s>
<s> i have wxp drivers built into the win xp installation </s>
<s> but not the 2000 installation </s>
<s> i found some third party drivers that worked fairly well </s>
<s> i installed driver software on a win 98 platforn and did not have a problem </s>
<s> pictures images were very clean </s>
