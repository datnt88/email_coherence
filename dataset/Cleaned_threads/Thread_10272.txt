<s> i have an abit aa8xe mainboard which will supports up to 4gig of single dual channel dimm modules delivering bandwidth of 8 5gb sec </s>
<s> it originally used ddr2 400 but i have some newer ddr2 800 pc6400 </s>
<s> will there be any compatibility issues </s>
<s> compatibility depends on the actual dimms </s>
<s> as long as they have spd timings for ddr2 533 and can function with 1 8v you should be ok ddr2 400 is a rare beast nowadays </s>
<s> thanks for your input i got it working good with both speeds of ram </s>
<s> now if i can get the second memory bank slots to accept my other 1gb sticks </s>
