<s> tell me what you guys think </s>
<s> good deal i am seriously considering purchasing that machine </s>
<s> i would recommend a downgrade of the ram from 4gb down to 3gb windows 32bit can only use a maximum of 3 3 gb </s>
<s> and i noticed that you re quot upgrading quot from the original 3gb that runs at 800mhz the 3gb at 800mhz is more suitable for gaming </s>
<s> also keep in mind though that there have been numerous dell threads that talk about how the esata port doesn t work </s>
<s> it s fixable but the current solution is a complete clean reinstall of vista </s>
<s> if that s not a huge problem for you then this deal definitely looks really sweet </s>

<s> i m considering this configuration almost also but they don t offer it with windows xp </s>
<s> they do offer their xps 210 computers with xp </s>
<s> i m going to call them today to see if they ll make an exception </s>
<s> yeah the esata isn t really a big deal for me </s>
<s> so i should just get it with the 3gb then huh </s>
<s> im down for that too </s>
<s> i really wanted this to be available with xp too </s>
<s> i ve heard of way too many glitches and problems with vista </s>
<s> is there anything else that i need if i wanted to use my 42 quot hdtv with this machine </s>
<s> if so what else would i need </s>
<s> hey if you give them a call can you let me know what they said </s>
<s> if they say yeah then id give them a call as well </s>
<s> just finished chatting with the dell guy </s>
<s> getting this computer with xp just isn t an option </s>
<s> does anyone have any experience installing xp on this computer or is it a quot vista quot centric computer </s>
<s> i remember somebody telling me that one can install both os on the same computer and that you get the option of choosing whether you want to use xp or vista </s>
<s> i remember reading that somewhere a long time ago </s>
<s> anybody know if i right or wrong </s>
<s> as you can probably tell im not really great at computers </s>
