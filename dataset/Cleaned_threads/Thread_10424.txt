<s> hi shinyame like you i just bought cx4700 3 weeks ago </s>
<s> everything works except the scanner </s>
<s> i tried everything reinstalling the software download latest software and driver etc but to no avail </s>
<s> both my laptops having the same problem </s>
<s> i searched and googled and finally i found another forums where some people was having problem with their usb scanner not epson and some one suggested that the usb cable might be the problem </s>
<s> the usb1 1 cable doesn t have a good shielding compared to the usb2 0 </s>
<s> today i went back to the shop and specifically requested a usb2 0 cable </s>
<s> they gave me a usb cable from cooler master </s>
<s> on the back of the package it says it s usb1 1 and usb2 0 compatible and it has emi shielding </s>
<s> after i plugged it in the scanner works perfectly </s>
<s> i hope this works for you </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> tian </s>
<s> i had the same problem with my epson all in one dx4200 device </s>
<s> i could copy and print but not scan </s>
<s> i have tried everything from removing background processes to playing with control panel getting a new cable chatting with epson etalk support etc </s>
<s> nothing worked </s>
<s> then i installed one usb card on one of my pci slots </s>
<s> it worked </s>
<s> it s not the usb ports that have problems because i use microsoft wireless mouse on it and a usb card reader which work fine but those epson drivers which were definately poorely written </s>
