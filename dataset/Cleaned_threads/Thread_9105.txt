<s> my desktop pc has two units of 256mb ddram which was pretty good at the time the machine was built </s>
<s> but i m thinking about upgrading now that i could quadruple that amount of memory for probably 200 </s>
<s> so my question is what kind of performance increase can i reasonably expect for that kind of upgrade </s>
<s> i realize there are many factors in play here but for those who have upgraded memory have you found it to be a worthwhile expense </s>
<s> or should i wait until prices drop </s>
<s> just wondering if this is worth my while </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> we took identical 2 4ghz p4 machines and ran a test </s>
<s> 1 had 512mb the other was 1gb </s>
<s> a 6 hour video encoding took 5 minutes less on the machine with 1gb </s>
<s> to be fair we exchanged the memory sticks and reran the test </s>
<s> about 5 minute savings </s>
<s> for us that was not enough payback </s>
<s> but then again the bragging rights may be worth it </s>

<s> if you typically have a lot of apps open or use memory intensive apps additional memory can noticeably improve performance </s>
<s> when you have your usual apps open and you ve been using them for awhile open task manager right click an empty area of the task bar select the performance tab and compare your commit charge total and peak to physical memory total </s>
<s> these figures are in kilobytes kb divide by 1024 to get megabytes mb </s>
<s> if your commit charge total how much memory you re consuming currently is more than your physical memory total then i d definitely recommend more ram since you re using all your ram and spilling over into the page file </s>
<s> if your commit charge peak the peak memory used since windows started is extremely high compared to your commit charge total and exceeds physical memory total then some software app you ve used is very memory intensive i e </s>
<s> a game photoshop custom business software etc </s>
<s> additional memory will speed up that app but if you re satisfied with the app s performance or only use it occassionally an upgrade may not be worth while </s>
<s> if you re wondering where your memory is going look at the processes tab in task manager </s>
<s> click mem usage to sort </s>
<s> on my pc currently ie 6 windows is consuming about 100mb firefox another 70mb and acrobat reader another 65mb </s>
<s> even common every day apps can munch ram </s>
