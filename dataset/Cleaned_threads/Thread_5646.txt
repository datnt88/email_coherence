<s> i need help finding the best wireless networking system </s>
<s> i need it to reach like 500 ft and through maybe 5 walls </s>
<s> what system has the best range and the best for the price </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> all stock systems have limited and specific power output per fcc regulations </s>
<s> all the name brands are good i use d link </s>
<s> but extenders are available </s>
<s> so far i ve had to install another wap where needed when range and walls impede the signal </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i was thinking that maybe the netgear system is good because they have those wall outlet extentions which i could set up all over the house </s>
<s> would this work </s>
<s> thanks for help </s>
<s> i have a linksys system right now i tried the n range thing but that didnt work as good as it sounded </s>
<s> then i tried the n range and the range expansion from linksys and still that did not work that good </s>
<s> i would get signal then it would go away then come back </s>
<s> what i really would like is a strong enough signal for my ps3 which has a built in wifi signal </s>
<s> i tested it out next to the router and it worked but i want the ps3 in tv room not the computer room </s>
<s> thanks </s>
