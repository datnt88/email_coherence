<s> hi i have been using windows xp professional with my current setup and its been really slowing down as of yet </s>
<s> i was wondering if maybe trying out the windows vista beta was worth a try or the 64 bit version of xp to speed up the system or maybe someone can give me any other other advice as to speed it up </s>
<s> my rig amd athlon 64 x2 3800 asus a8n sli mobo patriot signature series 1gb dual channel radeon x800xl pcie 256 mb ddr any comments would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> unless you need a specific 64 bit app i don t recommend upgrading to xp 64 </s>
<s> all of your hardware may not be supported </s>
<s> as for your perceived slow down consider optimizing your system defrag remove uneeded tray background apps optimize page file add ram etc </s>
<s> since you re willing to move to xp 64 a reinstall of windows could be beneficial </s>
<s> it seems that the os takes forever to load one program </s>
<s> when i first built the system it would let me run two or three different tasks at once with no problem </s>
<s> now i have issues when i am trying to use internet explorer and media player at the same time </s>
<s> i just get tired of reinstalling windows </s>
<s> is there a reason that causes this slowdown as i have defragged and optimized the page files and all already </s>
<s> do you have any p2p file sharing programs or torrent programs running </s>
<s> have you run any antivirus and antispyware scans lately </s>
<s> are you running any norton products </s>
<s> reinstalling windows will do little if your pc continues to run a lot of background apps or has exhausted its ram </s>
<s> do you have sufficient memory </s>
<s> when you pc seems sluggish open task manager and check how much available physical memory you have </s>
<s> also check your commit charge </s>
<s> if physical memory is less than 100 000k 100mb or commit charge is more than 1 5 times your physical ram you should add more memory </s>
<s> do you have a lot of background apps </s>
<s> if your system tray has more 10 icons consider removing some helper apps </s>
<s> quicktime adobe real creative ms office and many other products add helper apps that suck ram and performance but can be disabled without issue </s>
<s> is your anti virus paranoid </s>
<s> av programs can sap performance if they are configured to check everything all the time </s>
<s> if you re a careful user and use a good isp you can relax some settings such as checking every e mail checking every file on use etc </s>
<s> os s dont really slow down </s>
<s> try scanning for adware spyware or viruses </s>
<s> try using ewido ad aware pc cillin 30 day trial </s>
<s> uncheck start up keys that you dont need in msconfig </s>
<s> type msconfig in quot run quot and then click the start up tab </s>
<s> download ccleaner free from download com and delete invalid registry keys </s>
<s> its safe to delete keys using this program because it only scans for invalid keys and gives you a list of registry keys that are safe to delete </s>
<s> check your cpu and ram usage in the task manager under preformance during normal tasks </s>
<s> if the cup or ram is almost always being 100 used there might be a hardware problem </s>
<s> open up your computer s case and remove as much dust as you can </s>
<s> dust can cause slow downs and even overheating by acting like a blanket on your motherboard </s>
<s> i hope some of these make your computer run faster </s>
<s> i also wouldnt recomend a beta os because a newer beta will come out later or the official os will be out and you will have to upgrade again </s>
<s> i would stick to windows xp for now </s>
<s> open bsd or dragonfly </s>
<s> this may not refer to you because your talking about a vista beta which is obsolete </s>
<s> but vista will slow down any system incredible due to all the resources it uses </s>
<s> xp should be okay with a gig of ram but a clean install might help </s>
<s> i would go with simple unix based systems or both are very good </s>
<s> check them out your computer will run like new </s>
<s> i recommend deleting the whole hard drive but you can dual boot with windows pretty seamlessly </s>
<s> there are some limitations with the programs available but it s worth it and a learning experience </s>
