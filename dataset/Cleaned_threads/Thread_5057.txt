<s> i have in my mind that the better way to backup photos would be to put them on an external hard drive </s>
<s> i am forever hunting for the correct cd or dvd they would be easy to get to from other computers to edit or to store from a laptop on a trip i think i would only use it to store photos so i hope it would last many years or am i expecting too much </s>
<s> just as dependable as internals </s>
<s> and just as internals you still need to back them up since a virus or failure will cause the files to vanish </s>
<s> in one line quot hard disks are temporary storage quot bob </s>
<s> they lost their external hard disk contents </s>
<s> just vanished </s>
<s> and this is just one of the pleas for help you read about this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks robert if i decide to try it i will definately keep dvd backups </s>
<s> i put an 80 gig wd hd in a cheap plastic enclosure case and it s been running fine for months i ve even forgotten to turn it off and luckily didn t toast it </s>
<s> but as bob said it s temporary storage </s>
<s> it s convenient to carry about works really fast on my usb 2 connection and my network sees it </s>
<s> all fine and good </s>
<s> but i ve still archived everything important to cd dvd disks </s>
<s> disaster strikes just when you least expect it which reminds me i haven t backed up some important stuff in awhile thanks for reminder bob </s>
