<s> hello folks ok i have a laptop upstairs winxp networked to a downstars desktop win2k </s>
<s> works great </s>
<s> now i have a second desktop in that downstairs office hooked up to the same wireless router but while i can control it remotely via tightvnc i can t network it via windows explorer </s>
<s> wires are obviously there i created an identical user and password on that computer i can see new computer s name under the collective workgroup name i configured all drives to share but when i click on it it says i don t have access to this resource </s>
<s> what am i missing </s>
<s> thanks fj </s>
<s> have you configured the firewall correctly </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> i didn t think of that </s>
<s> have freebie zone alarm need to put the other comps in the trusted zone </s>
<s> will give it a try </s>
<s> thanks so much </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> there is no firewall software running on the new comp </s>
<s> again i can access it as a remote desktop using tight vnc but no access to any folders not even public ones the network resouce is not available </s>
<s> is there a trick to which user id i use to configure the workgroup name </s>
<s> the computer knows it s on the workgroup but won t allow any access to it </s>
<s> probably somthing simple i am missing fj </s>
<s> the firewalls on the other computers in the lan and xp accounts </s>
<s> you also have to allow the other firewalls to let the network data through </s>
<s> i am told but i haven t tried this myself that each xp computer on a network needs an account for the other computers eg if 3 users use one xp computer so they should each have their own account names </s>
<s> the same is true in a network that each computer needs an account on the others but like i say i have never done this myself so i can t say that this is definitely so </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> the firewall up here i forgot </s>
<s> lemme try that </s>
<s> well thanks very much for the free coaching </s>
<s> it worked </s>
<s> duh i forgot the ustair firewall </s>
<s> now i have to remember to configure the firewall on the other downstaors comp </s>
<s> well while i read every book i could find on home networking i never found a simple checklist and i am no expert but this is what i did networking xp and 2k machines 1 on each machine create an identical username that will exist as a username on each machine with the same name and password </s>
<s> give this name admin rights this user must have a password but for wake onlan etc i have another username with no password be the default startup user with no sign in window </s>
<s> all that matters is those common names and passwords just exist on all computers they don t have to be logged on apparently </s>
<s> 2 in win2k use the network wizard sytem network id to create a workgroup name </s>
<s> have each computer join this network same name </s>
<s> 3 in windows explorer under properties allow sharing </s>
<s> use the window to turn the disk names to plain not with sign as that makes it invisible </s>
<s> 4 allow access to ip addresses in all firewalls on all computers </s>
<s> may not be totally correct but that s what worked i think </s>
<s> never saw this simple list anywhere </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> and i agree that networking is never simple </s>
<s> i have my xp networked to an old windows me computer and setting it up on my own was a nightmare </s>
<s> but at least you re up and running now which is good </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> that you an me machine at all and that you networked it too </s>
<s> thanks again for the advice really helped fj </s>
