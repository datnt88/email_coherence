<s> hi all i m currently running windows vista home premium 32 bit on an intel duo 2 2ghz with 2 gigs of ram </s>
<s> i recently acquired a panasonic tx 26lxd50 tv with the intention of using it as my primary monitor so i could play wow on a larger screen </s>
<s> i ve connected it via a scart to s video cable </s>
<s> the problem is that the setup for my graphics card nvidia geforce 8400gs informs me that i can t have a resolution higher than 1024x768 on the tv which is rather blurry and not very easy on my eyes </s>
<s> i ve tried updating my graphics card driver which did allow me to choose 1440x900 for my smaller monitor but not the tv i also tried using powerstrip to force a custom resolution but if anything that s worsened the problem </s>
<s> can anyone possibly help me to fix this or even just inform me that what i want to do isn t possible and i just wasted money on a tv i don t need </s>

<s> sorry bummer </s>

<s> should i have used something else </s>
<s> which do not make good monitor use </s>
<s> i think the rgb might make better connection for computer use </s>
<s> dvi or hdmi different vid card s </s>
<s> dvi would give you video only you would have to tap off for audio hdmi would give you both </s>
<s> your computer specs are a bit light however and you would likely unless you already have need to upgrade the power supply assuming this is a storebought puter </s>
<s> plus 2gb of ram with vista will just get you by with 32 bit system try to run 3gb if possible </s>
<s> yes pal might be a tad lower or higher depending on how you look at it but at 480 lines the screen should be only good for playing a dvd </s>
