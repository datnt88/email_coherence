<s> take a look at this software here this should tell you what you are just guessing at now </s>
<s> if it conforms what you suspect then you can take a look at the heat sink and fan assembly for the cpu </s>
<s> it could be something else but at least you will have an idea where to look </s>
<s> is this an off the shelf big box mfg pc or a byopc </s>
<s> the onlyh real way to tell is remove the hs fan clean the surfaces reapply thermal grease and reinstall the hs fan </s>
<s> i recommend downloading installing sensorsview to give you cpu and hdd temps </s>
<s> let us know what you find </s>
