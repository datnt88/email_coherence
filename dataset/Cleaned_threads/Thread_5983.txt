<s> i ll try my best to make sense of the situation </s>
<s> i have a brother laser printer which i have connected to my router wirelessly and a desktop connected to the same router via ethernet </s>
<s> yet when i go in windows to add a printer it cannot find it </s>
<s> i have the drivers installed and it works via usb </s>
<s> any advice </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> your desktop doesn t have wireless capability unless you install a wireless slot card or use a usb adapter </s>
<s> ah didn t know that was necessary </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it varies with the model but most require you to setup the wireless printer first not on your pc </s>
<s> then i install the printer driver and then it knows to look on the network </s>
<s> at no time do i need to add wifi to the desktop </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i tried that the first time but it didn t work </s>
<s> after reading your post i reset my printer and connected it to the router on the printer itself and my non wireless enabled desktop discovered it immediately </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> wireless to connect to your printer </s>
<s> as long as the printer is connected to your router and your computer is connected to your router either by wire or wireless you are golden as you have already discovered </s>
