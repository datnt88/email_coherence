<s> i had to download their drivers </s>
<s> my problem at this point is that i loaded the nvidia driver from the included cd but it won t run due to a code 10 error </s>
<s> i also loaded a driver from the nvidia website and it just killed the signal to my monitor when i booted it in </s>
<s> my display comes up with the motherboard winfast screen and has lines in groups of 4 or 5 running vertically down the screen a couple of inches apart and very splotchy texture </s>
<s> as soon as windows kicks in it smoothes out mostly </s>
<s> the display is very unstable as it will occasionally leave red pixels in a path behind my mouse movements </s>
<s> i have also had the display just slowly corrupt into garbage and lose signal </s>
<s> not being able to run the nvidia driver is killing me after 2 days of tinkering </s>
<s> i wanna see a game run </s>
<s> i am really suspicious of the motherboard </s>
<s> am i right in assuming that the winfast screen that first comes up is a signal coming straight from the motherboard </s>
<s> i think i shoulda bought the asus or msi </s>
<s> if anyone has any ideas i d greatly appreciate it </s>
<s> getting that motherboard is a bad idea </s>
<s> try downloading the nvidia drivers from the chaintech website </s>
<s> are you sure you downloaded the drivers for the motherboard right </s>
<s> if the motherboard did not have the driver cd return it </s>
<s> it could be because you ordered the oem version that 347 why </s>
<s> when you should have gotten the retai </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> actually it was retail </s>
<s> it was my first build so i tried to use it knowing that i could download the drivers from their site </s>
<s> i let new egg know what i thought about foxconn tho </s>
<s> i m leaning towards going with an asus board </s>
<s> thanks for the feedback </s>
