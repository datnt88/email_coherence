<s> hello i recently built a new pc that i installed an lg bd rom dvd rewriter </s>
<s> with the optical came a super multi blue install disc for windows ver </s>
<s> 1 1a </s>
<s> i installed the software with no problems until now </s>
<s> a few weeks ago i purchased a sony bd re 25 gb to be used to store a bunch of pictures music videos and docs in case of a harddrive failure </s>
<s> last night i went to copy all of these files to the bd re and burn however when i placed the disc in the optical the drive does not even recognize there s a disc and it spits the disc back out </s>
<s> i talked to a friend about this today who told me that a lot of the bd burners will have problems reading and writing to a bd re and it is necessary to install a third party software that will allow this to be accomplished </s>
<s> any truths to this or advice on how to deal with this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if my guess is correct you don t have a quot bd writer quot just a bd player </s>
<s> i am at work now so i don t have the model number w me but the front of the drive says bd rom dvd rewriter </s>
<s> same exact problem for me using a mac </s>
<s> what type of discs should be used with this unit </s>
<s> it turned out the member was recording the bd re on a dvr and trying to get them to work on the pc and other dvd br players </s>
<s> they seemed to stop posting when they switched to dvd rw or dvd rw media </s>
<s> the dvr offered a means to make dvd r w media compatible with other machines </s>
<s> as to an apple i fear that since apple didn t send out units with bd capability you ll have to question the maker of that bd drive </s>
<s> i can t comment further since many details are missing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob you are correct </s>
<s> my uncle selected the components for the new pc and is upset he didn t look at the specs of the drive more carefully </s>
<s> sometime down the road i may put mine on ebay or something and upgrade to a writer </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> jon </s>
<s> i think i m seeing the end of this medium for storage </s>
<s> today s users seem to be very impatient and will not accept the 10 minutes or so to create a dvd or bd disc </s>
<s> not only that but the cost of usb sticks and drives plummeted to make this media unloved by so many </s>
<s> i wonder how much longer we ll see this media </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bd rom i should have known </s>
<s> i been at this too long </s>
<s> rom read only media </s>
<s> of course it won t write bd media </s>
<s> won t even reconize the disk </s>
<s> whitemountains </s>
