<s> i need to replace my power supply </s>
<s> thing is i m pretty sure the model i have isn t made anymore </s>
<s> my question is can i go with different specs </s>
<s> i e can i go with a higher wattage </s>
<s> does the input voltage ampage need to match </s>
<s> basically what do i have to look for in the specs of a purchase so it s compatible with my tower </s>
<s> i m powering 1 hard drive 2 rom s audio video card and a floppy drive </s>
<s> i ve found some really good deals online but i dont want to buy something i cant use </s>
<s> here s my current specs input rating 115v 6a 230v 3a 50 60hz output rating 235w max red 5v 23a yellow 12v 9a white 5v 0 5a blue 12v 0 5a orange 3 3v 15a purple 5vsb 1a black gnd gray power good 3 3v 5v 115w max </s>
<s> if you use a generic system or plain build using a generic power supply based on the atx12v model you can use any wattage </s>
<s> the higher the better as it uses quot what it needs quot </s>
<s> make sure the p s unit mentions its for intel or and or amd rated for a better fit on your system </s>
<s> look should look at the physical size of things but usually your basic replacement is very swappable though a quot mini quot size is present </s>
<s> also expect some extra cables to daggle as you may not use all of them </s>
<s> look here for some clues if you have a local shop take in hand your old p s and then ask for a replacement even if it costs more its a done deal </s>
<s> however if you have a oem or big vendor build system like dell gateway etc make sure any replacament is rated for its use and or model installation but a higher wattage is still installable </s>
<s> here sizing wiring and or special connects will come into play so verify that </s>
<s> enjoy willy </s>
<s> there is someexcellent infor at tom s hardware guide specifically an article inadequate and deceptive product labeling comparison of 21 power supplies created october 21 2002 </s>
<s> you supplied a lot of info about the psu but you didn t say the make of the pc or the psu type at or atx </s>
<s> yes if you have a dell they use a modified atx psu </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> sorry guys i didnt know i needed to supply that info </s>
<s> my cpu is a built system from a little local company not a big vendor system </s>
<s> its pentium 3 i was going to go with a 300 watt pu from sparkle i think </s>
<s> in many cases 300w p s maybe enough if only the it is a decently made one </s>
<s> these cheap units you see now just don t cut it </s>
<s> understand also that the wattage rating is for the quot peak output quot it can support but not on a constant level so buy a larger p s unit you can afford </s>
<s> i should have mentioned 350w is a good start but 400w is better if you buy cheap then get the highest wattage you can find </s>
<s> it wouldn t hurt your system to have extra wattage it s just quot available on demand quot </s>
<s> try or for a good source of p s units and selection </s>
<s> you ll see the varying price range </s>
