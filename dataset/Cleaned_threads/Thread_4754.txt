<s> hello folks i have been researching superdrives for my jan 2008 a1181 dual core </s>
<s> there seem to be 3 main compatable models gsas10n uj 857c and uj 867a </s>
<s> i know they must be capped at 8xdvd and i want dual layer ability </s>
<s> the uj867a by panasonic seems to fit what i want </s>
<s> here are my 2 s </s>
<s> 1 is the panasonic 867a nov 2010 9 5mm the best choice </s>
<s> 2 sata or pata </s>
<s> i know sata is a bit faster but is that what s in there already </s>
<s> the 2010 new super i am looking at is pata is the current optical a sata </s>
<s> and should i just try to find a sata uj 857c in good shape </s>
<s> i know somewhere someone has already asked smthg similar but by page 20 and the cnet search yielded no answers </s>
<s> thank you for any help </s>
<s> and be assured that you have the right optical drive for your machine </s>
<s> sata or pata depends entirely on what is already in there </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> i have been there </s>
<s> i have watched about 6 videos and 30 sites including amazon and ebay to view over 300 different drives dating from mid 07 to current </s>
<s> there are 3 so far types that claim to be oem replacement supers for the already installed optical </s>
<s> some claim the replacement is sata and some claim pata all for the exact model i have </s>
<s> removing the current drive and looking at what s in there is an option but the satas and patas both claim to offer the adapting cable to utilize the other format </s>
<s> i have been building and configuring computers for 22 years </s>
<s> from the old pizza box desktops to uu19 racks and this is the craziest thing i ve ever run accross </s>
<s> it s a a1181 feb 2008 mb402ll a macbook 4 1 dual core 2 1 currently running snow leopard </s>
<s> how hard should this be </s>
<s> all three types listed in my first post claim to be oem </s>
<s> this is a crapshoot </s>
<s> if i can t get specific info to buy the drive ranging from 25 to 200 i m just going to throw a dart and see where it lands </s>
<s> thanks for the response so far i do appreciate it </s>
<s> i m just frustrated </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> same version the 10n as a new eide on amazon for 50 from panasonic which claims to be oem brand </s>
<s> there are 3 model types and two connectivity standards for the exact same model </s>
<s> i understand oem can be several different companies due to supply chain issues </s>
<s> it s the 2 connectivity standards that claim to be original for the exact same model i question </s>
