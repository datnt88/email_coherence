<s> hey i have 1 gt 640 and i play cod4 and looking into upgrading my video </s>
<s> what would be better </s>
<s> how fast would 2 dual nvidia gt 640 vs 1 nvidia gtx 660 ti be </s>
<s> i run a ok 250fps on my 1 gt 640 now but with a super low config file and rez set to 1440 </s>
<s> that s a big jump </s>
<s> that parallel stuff 2xgt might turn out to be a big headache </s>
<s> make sure you have a psu that can handle that card </s>
<s> i find those with dual and more cards to be too hard to support </s>
<s> or rather the problems often mean we have to re vamp the machine to get it to work as well as they expected </s>
<s> a single card is the easy path </s>
<s> your choice but if you go with dual cards be sure you have support on hand and a thick wallet </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> quot dual cards quot has always been a problem in the long run </s>
<s> to me dual worked well only during the demo days at a computer show in my land </s>
<s> thereafter it was one problem after another </s>
<s> had to go back to single card coz support for dual wasn t free a tall </s>
<s> suit yourself </s>
<s> great for demos </s>
<s> thanks all that pretty well says it gtx is the go </s>
<s> i only just joined cnet and got answers that night </s>
<s> love it </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
