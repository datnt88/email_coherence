<s> i have been having frequent disconnects there records show error code one which means user disconnect which is from my router </s>
<s> now that being said i have replaced numerous routers that display the same symptoms of either disconnects and slow bandwidth </s>
<s> the isp sends out a tech armed with only a laptop and using a speed test to test there systems and nothing else </s>
<s> according to the techs either help desk or their service techs since there is no modem </s>
<s> which tells me they haven t figured out the fiber optics has to translate to and from the computer or modem </s>
<s> one fiber optic line to multiplexer demultiplexer to go from one serial to how ever many cat 5 address lines what i just wrote is a oversimplification of the process since telephone cable tv uses this line as well and other processes occur as well to get internet access </s>
<s> now the big question what test equipment do i need to see the true speed of my access i have to prove to them it is not the routers fault since i agree with linksys that to have the same symptoms appear on all the routers i have owned </s>
<s> what disconnects from what the pc s all connected pc s and laptops either wired or wireless from the router or the router from the modem or the modem from the isp </s>
<s> if the test results from the tech connecting to the same router are ok why do you think it s the router or anything after it </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> sorry wired and wireless used linksys model wrtgl about 5 of them but new one is linksys e 300 2 desktops wired 1 laptop wireless </s>
<s> the router places the connection </s>
<s> symptoms is slowdown with frequent disconnects which shows up at the isp as an error 1 or user requested disconnect </s>
<s> so the techs only answer is faulty router as a matter of fact they dropped off another router brand new but the e 3000 is under a month old and under warranty to tell all of what they said would take volumes and all they did is hooked there laptop and ran oakalla speed test to test there system nothing else </s>
<s> at any point when i have called always the router thus replacing routers since no other providers in area i have to prove that it is not the router and according to my wife she believes we have been blackballed as a trouble customer due to calling about the trouble </s>
<s> to many times </s>
<s> my wife depends upon the internet for work and the slow downs and disconnects wrecks havoc on the online database she connects to </s>
<s> the techs see a drop from the router on there laptop but not from direct connection to cat5 </s>
<s> what i think is the problem is the auto sensor on the wan port gets confused as to which speed to connect 10 or 100 thus slows down while trying to switch and goes into i do not know state and reboots connection </s>
<s> reconnects fine for awhile then repeats thus all the disconnects and reconnects over the day another words lots of error code one s </s>
<s> the speed will seldom change on a ethernet port but the duplex causes all kinds of issues </s>
<s> the default if it cannot figure it out is to run at half duplex which causes all kinds of errors when you try to run a lot of traffic </s>
<s> i suspect the only way you will get it to work is to leave it on auto </s>
<s> the description of why gets complex but what happens if you set yours to full and they leave theirs on auto you get your end on full and their end on half </s>
<s> the worst possible case </s>
<s> a error like this causes huge loss so it is easy to test </s>
<s> just run a continuous ping to the default gateway with a packet size of say 1300 i would do it with a directly connected pc first </s>
<s> even if you have other errors running a ping to the default gateway of the isp tests the connection to your house </s>
<s> if that is clean but you still have issues it is further into their network and does not just affect you </s>
<s> note the isp can also ping from their device to your house </s>
<s> you need to call them when it is happening so they can see it they do not need to come to your house to test </s>
<s> the router is at it s defaults no modifacations </s>
<s> this is the third router that has the problem exact same problem that i can prove </s>
<s> thothers i have tossed all had same problem exact problem </s>
<s> now either i have had extremely bad luck when it comes to routers as per say linksys or something is going on at there end </s>
<s> the chances of two dieing in the exact matter is extremely rare three or four quote astromomical senior tech from linksys </s>
<s> you see the isp dumps there band with in a pool and i recieve up to max speed of 10 megabits of data rate </s>
<s> and since i thought all isp s went to selling in bit s and not bytes never checked </s>
<s> my solution is to go with att and and get a 3 megabyte for half the price shame on me for assumeing </s>
<s> most likely they have over sold there bandwidth again and the ups and downs is caused by users connecting and disconneting meaning i am sharing with to many people again </s>
<s> had a good solid 6 months after thier last upgrade </s>
<s> been with them for 13 yrs </s>
<s> my wife has been making the circuits around her and she stated everyone she talked to has the same problem </s>
<s> she did ask them did they call and complain and they said no </s>
<s> and she said then what do you do they said when it gets bad they go watch tv or find something else to do then come back to it later </s>
<s> this is a farming community out in tthe middle of no where they are use to bad service and believe they are lucky to have them in so they do not rock the boat </s>
<s> it is a shame but that is how it is and how they are use to this so they will wait till another company comes along and they will most likely do as they did to the other company that was once here be a flood to the next company </s>
<s> sorry for the rant folks </s>
