<s> i have need to upgrade my cpu from a pentium d 930 3 00 ghz and i was wondering might be compatible with my computer </s>
<s> would this cpu be ok on my comp </s>
<s> they made it they know the compatibility </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> you need to check the specs of the current cpu you have </s>
<s> visit the sony support website and review or check the manual of same and note the specs </s>
<s> once in hand visit the cpu maker support website and look up that cpu </s>
<s> usually the cpu maybe listed or surfed until a list is found under that class type what is available </s>
<s> find the cpu that is a level higher and get it </s>
<s> of course you need to know the range the mtrbd </s>
<s> bios allows for such an upgrade </s>
<s> its very important to be sure your mtrbd </s>
<s> is at the latest bios update if not do so </s>
<s> this will allow the support of any level of cpu or better support of same otherwise it would be a waste of time </s>
<s> this also includes any fsb or jumper setting that match the needs of the new cpu or is quot auto set quot from the bios itself </s>
<s> if the proper cpu class type are followed it won t damage the mtrbd </s>
<s> and it should easily be acknowledged excluding any manual setting </s>
<s> otherwise the cpu upgrade if not supported or requires more than the mtrbd </s>
<s> allows the upgrade is mute </s>
<s> this is sometimes the end result for oem because they re not as flexible to such or very limited range </s>
<s> also make sure the cooling matches what the cpu requires if not supplied in the cpu upgrade kit </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> did what you recommended and found a processor thats easily twice as good but will function well in my case </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
