<s> i want to replace the motherboard on my old gateway 832gm </s>
<s> i want to replace it with a newer motherboard compatible with 2nd gen intel i3 or i5 </s>
<s> any suggestions since it is an old batx form chassis </s>
<s> if the computer faces you the chassis opens on the right side </s>
<s> if the pc is that old i strongly suggest you just leave it </s>
<s> bite the bullet and get a new case or least a more newer spacious type in order to benefit the install of the i3 i5 mtrbd and start with a better foundation as it were </s>
<s> not to pick on you but sometimes its better this way </s>
<s> if you re trying to save costs then rethink what would happen it after all is said and done after shoe honing the new mtrbd </s>
<s> in and maybe finding a psu that fits etc you may bump up against some issue that was easily resolved with a newer case </s>
<s> you can simply just lay the parts out and connect them minus the case to see if they work and final mount them into the gateway case if you like </s>
<s> your main consideration is space will a new mtrbd </s>
<s> fit </s>
<s> typical oem based pcs tend to be build with only its details in mind so they don t provide an ease of install for other full blown upgrades </s>
<s> but if its generic enough it may be workable </s>
<s> i just find oem based pcs just get into problems all to easily on the most basic level usually physical size and or spacing </s>
<s> what has happened with newer pcs is the basic pc has more cooling and better psu and ram additions or similar details </s>
<s> all this boils down that a new pc a diy should also follow a similar path </s>
<s> a better wattage psu amps too and additional ram slots with leads to better cooling demands plus any video upgrades </s>
<s> even if non gaming use pc the new i3 i5 will expect no less </s>
<s> if for gaming then you better think all that in mind beforehand </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i totally agree with willy you would be better off setting up a new system from scratch </s>
<s> use the old gateway as secondary system and base a new unit on newer technology you will have much better results </s>
<s> shop around online for components newegg and others there are always deals and sales on hardware plus it is a lot of fun designing your own set up </s>
<s> have fun and good luck </s>
