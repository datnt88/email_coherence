<s> got a new laptop the cd drive has been acting up horribly </s>
<s> cds read at an incredibly low speed like half an hour for a 170mb install and whenever i try burning a cd i receive an error message </s>
<s> after the error message the drive will appear to continue doing things indefinitely and the eject button doesn t work </s>
<s> is this the drive that is messed up or is it a software problem </s>
<s> please use it </s>
<s> it s not your problem </s>
<s> well almost if you installed roxio software there is a bug with whats on the cd distribution that will cause what you complained about </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> haven t been using roxio </s>
<s> i tried with media player and sonic record now </s>
<s> i ll contact dell but i hope i don t have to send my laptop back in because i m in university right now and i need it </s>
<s> i don t know all software that creates the issue </s>
<s> you can try uninstalling any recording software that you installed after getting the machine </s>
<s> but before that try stopping the imapi service and trying again </s>
