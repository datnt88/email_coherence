<s> when your home desktop pc is not in use what do you think is the best practice to ensure its longevity and why </s>
<s> put it in sleep hibernate mode </s>
<s> a complete shutdown </s>
<s> it depends </s>
<s> i have no idea </s>
<s> please tell us the reasons why below </s>
<s> i am no pro by a long shot </s>
<s> but i think it would just be the sensible thing to do to shut down during the night </s>
<s> i run mine all day partly because i use system mechanic for many things and it runs in the background or when i am away from the pc it checks the registry drivers etc etc </s>
<s> and i seldom have problems </s>
<s> also i don t open a lot of different programs at once only what i need for whatever i am working on at the time </s>
<s> norma v </s>
<s> if you aren t going to use the computer for more than a couple of hours i would shut it down </s>
<s> the time saved by using the hibernate function is minimal and i m sorry microsoft but hibernate has always had problems </s>
<s> sleep is a viable option for short durations such as an hour or less and or if you need your computer to be up and running in a real hurry </s>
<s> but powering it down and allowing windows to reboot when you need it will always save you money hardware usage and headaches </s>
<s> if you are in a hurry to reboot windows try a solid state drive for your operating system and programs </s>
<s> mine boots faster from scratch than it ever did coming out of sleep mode with a regular hard disk drive and with fewer glitches </s>
<s> that s just my experienced layman s opinion </s>
<s> hello everyone actually we should completely shutdown the system if we don t have to use it for longer time </s>
<s> because the hibernate option put effect on your memory i e </s>
<s> ram because every system program has to be saved in the running mode </s>
<s> this think on one side have advantage for memory also have one disadvantage for system which is we have to boot it when we want to use it </s>
<s> on the other hand if you are not using system but for shorter time period we should hibernate because it will save the boot time of the system </s>
<s> overnight computers at our house get shut down </s>
<s> for a couple of hours they are probably left on </s>
<s> for a laptop or desktop not on a vpn i would let it sleep </s>
<s> however if my desktop or laptop are connected to my work vpn a pain to manually reconnect to i would just leave them on no sleeping or hibernating </s>
<s> then they ll stay connected to the vpn although they might need to do an automatic reconnect depending on how long it s been </s>
<s> so there s no one answer for me whatever makes more sense given the situation is what i ll do smile </s>
<s> but off overnight definitely </s>
