<s> hey i was just recently browsing through tigerdirect when i came across this motherboard </s>
<s> i looked at the specs and the picture and it seems to be everything i was looking for for a new motherboard </s>
<s> it is sli certified has 4 sata ports 3 pci slots socket 775 compatible with my pentium d core 2 duo ready gigabit lan support and 4 dimm sockets that support up to a decent 667mhz ddr2 240 pin memory modules </s>
<s> what is the downside to this mobo </s>
<s> what am i overlooking </s>
<s> is this a reliable brand </s>
<s> what seperates this mobo from the 600 ones </s>
<s> is the chipset any good </s>
<s> if not will it effect graphics performance greatly </s>
<s> could you send me a link to some other mobos that are better sli ready and a reasonable price </s>
<s> the site is tigerdirect ca so the price is in can dollers </s>
<s> anandtech com tomshardware com pcper com hothardware com xbitlabs com etc you could also go to newegg com to read actual buyer reviews comments of the product </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i never trust ecs jetway epox mach speed pcchips etc mobos these mobos have no nice tech support and can t be used more than 2 3years because of the weak capicator </s>
<s> these mobo are expensive but really good even good at overclocking 1 evga 680i 16x16 2 asus p5n32 sli 16x16 3 asus p5n sli 8x8 better choose a mobo which works sli in 16x mode </s>
<s> there are many other mobos in sli </s>
<s> the chipset on that mobo failed to meet the high expectations for an nforce chipset </s>
<s> the 610 was the first to be considered to be as good as or slightly better than the intel chipsets </s>
<s> look closely though some of the intel chipsets have zero support for pata drives </s>
<s> although on a given mobo the mobo mfr may add a chip to provide one pata ide port 2 drives </s>
<s> i think the 600 motherboards you see are actually combo deals </s>
<s> motherboard cpu motherboard video card etc </s>
<s> thanks that little bit of info helped me understand the pricing of motherboards </s>
<s> just one other question what exactly is the purpose of the little 1 quot slot next to the pci express slot i know that its a part of the pci e slot but that is its purpose </s>
<s> i cant seem to find anything on a video card that would plug into the slot </s>
<s> not even the big monster video cards that take up two expansion slots </s>
