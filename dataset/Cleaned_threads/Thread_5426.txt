<s> hello ive done something really stupid </s>
<s> i sent my computer off for repair apple powerbook g4 but as it was not going to be ready before i left on my travels i asked the repair company to send me my hard drive 60gb </s>
<s> i put the hard drive in a caddy and connected it to my friends mac heres the stupid bit i put an ac power source and not dc as it said on the caddy and now my friends ex usb port dosnt work nor does my hard drive </s>
<s> i have tried it in a new caddy but it still does not work </s>
<s> does anybody have any ideas </s>
<s> cheers lee </s>
<s> data recovery houses </s>
<s> try drivesavers com and ontrack com bob </s>
<s> just as a matter of interest who makes the quot caddy quot that takes a laptop hd and makes it connect to a usb port </s>
<s> sounds like a piece of kit that could come in handy </s>
<s> i use an adapter to connect laptop drives to an ide cable and take power from the computers power supply or from an external drive enclosure </s>
<s> my other question is how do you put ac into a device that only needs dc </s>
<s> sounds like a design flaw </s>
<s> on another note was the hd working before you sent the machine away and does the drive only fit into the caddy one way </s>
<s> how do you determine which pins carry the dc voltage for the drive </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> when you installed the hard drive mechanism in the drive case you would have seen the electronics on one side of the drive </s>
<s> one item you did not see was the motor that drives the spindle that spins the platters at 7200 rpm that hold the data </s>
<s> also not visible to you are the armature mechanisms that hold the drive heads that move across the platters that read and write the data </s>
<s> if the external circuit board blew out that might be easy for a drive repair data recovery company to fix </s>
<s> chances are pretty good that in addition to blowing out that circuit board the spindle motor and the armature mechanisms were impacted by the surge in ac power </s>
<s> there is a slight chance that the heads being held by the armatures went bananas and could have scruffed the platter surfaces </s>
<s> if only external stuff was impacted that is one thing but if anything internal was impacted the only way to get to the data is to actually open the drive in a special quot clean room quot and with special tools read the platters sector by sector and recover whatever may be recoverable </s>
<s> i presume you had no data back ups bummer </s>
<s> good luck </s>
