<s> i m planning on buying a new laptop soon since my current hp zt3000 s monitor does not work properly works 1 50 times the laptop is turned on so it s constantly hooked to an external and well no longer a laptop costs around 600 to have it fixed by buying a new motherboard </s>
<s> i remember when i bought a desktop 6 years ago i went with an amd because they were generally cheaper than the pentiums and performance wise they were almost the same </s>
<s> with all this new intel dual core inter core duo and amd dual core i m kinda lost now </s>
<s> what s the best option out there </s>
<s> what metric do you use to determine quot best quot </s>
<s> if it is performance then the core 2 duo would be the winner while if it is bang for the buck then it may vary a bit </s>
<s> i would suggest a dual core laptop e g </s>
<s> intel core duo core 2 duo which is the successor to core duo or amd turion 64 x2 if you do any cpu intensive tasks </s>
<s> i would likely stay away from celeron or sempron laptops unless you don t mind having a low power processor as these are for low end systems which isn t the same as saying they use less electricity </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> definitely go with a dual core laptop </s>
<s> there are 3 main flavors intel core duo intel core 2 duo and amd turion 64 x2 </s>
<s> sometimes you ll see quot pentium dual core quot which is really a core duo </s>
<s> the turion 64 x2s are about as fast as a core duo at the same processor speed ghz core 2 duo is about 12 faster at the same processor speed </s>
