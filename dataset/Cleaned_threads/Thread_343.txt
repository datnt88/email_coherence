<s> i am using arctic cooling freezer 7 as my cpu fan and my cpu temperature is 40 c idle and 60 c fully loaded </s>
<s> i think it is pretty high and it may reduce my cpu life </s>
<s> should i get a better cpu heatsink </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> computer spec 3 2ghz pentium 4 640 </s>
<s> gotten an amd </s>
<s> they outperform and consume much less power </s>
<s> i have a p4 630 and the temps are about 2 4 deg c higher than yours and i think they run that way </s>
<s> btw my temp was not that high </s>
<s> it was 36 idle and 47 loaded </s>
<s> after i replaced my powersupply it was burnt i think i touched the heatsink during the process and no matter how i mounted and tighten the heatsink it is not as good as it was b4 </s>
<s> im sure it has nothin to do with the psu because i replaced with the same one </s>
<s> i think it s just my heatsink clamps are not as tight as it was b4 </s>
