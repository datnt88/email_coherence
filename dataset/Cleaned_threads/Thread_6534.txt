<s> i m looking for a good reliable all in one to print copy and fax </s>
<s> all the user reviews of hps products have made me want to avoid them like the plague but there s not many other choices </s>
<s> canon looks like a good yet not perfect fit </s>
<s> i need a good printer copier that does well with drawings and text </s>
<s> printing photos isn t the most important issue though it would be nice </s>
<s> i also need a fax that has an auto document feeder that works which seems like the weakness of most that i ve looked at </s>
<s> am i better off getting a print copier combo and a dedicated fax or there any machines that do it all well </s>
<s> i do not like the concept and therefore i haven t paid much attention to them </s>
<s> this one got good reviews on the forum earlier </s>
<s> it has all the features your looking for except i don t know what kind of drawings you will be printing out but they should look good </s>
<s> just make sure you use diffusion or the high quality print setting for drawings </s>
<s> also run a automatic printhead alignment </s>
<s> the text is near laser quality and graphics are very good and it also has a adf </s>
<s> the adf seems to work the best out of all the ones i have had </s>
<s> the photo quality is excellent </s>
<s> officemax and newegg com both sell them for around 200 </s>
