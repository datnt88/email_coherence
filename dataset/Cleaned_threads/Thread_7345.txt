<s> i get around computers pretty well but i m a wireless networking newbie </s>
<s> and after plenty of research and phone calls to tech support i m stumped </s>
<s> i just bought a new hp pavilion dv9700t </s>
<s> i also bought the d link dir 655 to connect to my five year old custom built desktop pc </s>
<s> i have cable internet through a motorola surfboard modem </s>
<s> so i popped in the cd and ran the setup wizard </s>
<s> everything seemed to go fine the wizard detected all my connection didn t even ask me any questions and i was good to go </s>
<s> but i noticed right away that my internet connection was significantly slower </s>
<s> usable but about 80 slower than normal i tested it </s>
<s> so i removed the router from the equation and just hooked up the desktop pc to the cable modem </s>
<s> the internet speed was back to normal </s>
<s> i reconnected the router and reset it </s>
<s> updated the firmware </s>
<s> read the manual visited online support and mess with every setting i could think of </s>
<s> still the connection was slow </s>
<s> i should mention at this point that both the desktop pc and pavilion had similarly slow speeds through the router </s>
<s> i confirmed with my cable company that it wasn t a setting on their end that needed adjusting </s>
<s> then i called d link </s>
<s> on the online configuration tool they had me go under the setup tab then to manual internet connection setup then entering 4 2 2 2 in the primary dns server box and 4 2 2 3 in the secondary dns server box </s>
<s> they tried to explain what this meant but i didn t catch it </s>
<s> this caused me to lose my internet connection entirely </s>
<s> after a couple more calls to d link in which they had me do little else besides cloning my pc s mac address a couple of times and unplugging replugging my modem and router i still had no internet connection </s>
<s> so they told me to return the router for a new one </s>
<s> then just for the hell of it i rebooted and got my internet connection back although it is still slow </s>
<s> so what can i do </s>
<s> is it really defective or is there something else to adjust </s>
<s> i have read where this router just doesn t work for some people but i assumed that to mean it didn t work at all </s>
<s> any advice is great as i would prefer not to send this back if at all possible </s>
<s> sorry but a few details are missing in your post so i ll just offer a common fix </s>
<s> i guess that s an option </s>
<s> but it doesn t really solve the problem </s>
<s> what details am i missing </s>
<s> i ll fill in the blanks if i can </s>
<s> and is it setup per our forum sticky </s>
<s> some leave it on open wifi connections or wep and their network is pirated away by neighbors </s>
<s> also there are issues with p2p software and speed so i won t be helping on that area here as it s all about the sofware used not in the posts as well as how such speed was measured </s>
<s> hope there s something that can be done </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it was late last night and i didn t think to look over forum rules </s>
<s> i think my router setup is per the forum sticky if i m interpreting it correctly </s>
<s> regardless i did it exactly as d link s setup cd instructed me to </s>
<s> here it is coaxial cable from wall to cable modem </s>
<s> ethernet cable from desktop pc to lan port 1 on the router </s>
<s> another ethernet cable from quot internet quot port on router back to cable modem </s>
<s> i would show you a diagram but i can t find one on d link s support site </s>
<s> to answer your other questions i don t think anyone is pirating the connection </s>
<s> i ve checked this numerous times </s>
<s> i have reset the router many times so the settings are back to default but i had set it to wpa 2 and secured the connection and it did not help </s>
<s> i have the most current firmware for the router </s>
<s> as for speed normally my download speed runs between 5 000 6 000 kb s but once the router is connected that drops to around 1 200 kb s on both the wired desktop pc and the wireless notebook </s>
<s> i ve measured it through the speed tests at broadbandreports com </s>
<s> i think that covers everything from the sticky let me know if i can provide more information </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> disable the wifi so we re sure </s>
<s> the issue we know of can not be detected with any ease by most owners but setting it up per the forum sticky does cure that issue </s>
<s> for now </s>
<s> disable it </s>
<s> if it s still bad return for some other model </s>
<s> that the firewall or the content filtering is slowing things down </s>
<s> i know he said he s all wired do disabling the radio will help </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> no clear feedback on the exact router settings </s>
<s> no exact feedback if they are using some static settings and so on </s>
<s> i ve been slow to ask for this since some take it badly if you pressure them to engage in their discussion </s>
<s> this is not that easy for some to find out the answers to simple questions for those that setup networks daily but i try to go with simple things to shut out the more common issues such as the wifi hijacking issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but there are so many settings in the online configuration and i m new enough at this that i don t have a good sense of what s important and what isn t or even what some of these settings do </s>
<s> so ask me what you need to know and i ll do my best to answer </s>
<s> i ve tried to adjust various settings too many to list and nothing has caused any improvement </s>
<s> right now the router has all its default settings because late last night i reset it per instructions from d link tech support </s>
<s> i have zone alarm on my desktop pc and comodo on my notebook and the internet speed through the router is the same on both </s>
<s> i have no indication via error messages popups etc </s>
<s> that the firewall is the issue </s>
<s> but i will check those settings and turn off the wi fi tonight and see if that helps </s>
<s> on wireless routers we usually update the firmware </s>
<s> some automatic updates don t work </s>
<s> normally we broadcast ssid use wpa security use nothing else </s>
<s> do not use mac addresses </s>
<s> since you re not using the wireless part then turn it off </s>
<s> check your firewall settings and turn them off </s>
<s> also turn off any of the filtering devices in the d link router </s>
<s> setup should look like wall gt cable modem router gt d link router gt wired wireless i don t know if there s some type of filter in the d link that will limit usage </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> i have tried everything you ve suggested individually and in various combinations </s>
<s> firmware is current </s>
<s> broadcasting in ssid </s>
<s> wpa security </s>
<s> turned off wi fi </s>
<s> adjusted firewall settings </s>
<s> turned off firewall </s>
<s> turned on wi fi but set it to a b g signal instead of n router setup is correct </s>
<s> made sure no d link filters were on as far as i could tell </s>
<s> and the results on my wired desktop pc were exactly the same about 80 lower than normal </s>
<s> so unless anybody has anything else i should try my question becomes is there any way to know whether the dir 655 router simply won t work with my modem vs just having a bad router that needs to be replaced and should work fine under normal circumstances </s>
<s> even my dated di 524 didn t suffer like that </s>
<s> i do not have you model to look over at home office or lab </s>
<s> i will share i changed the home to a buffalo running openwrt because my still nice wpnt 834 would lock up monthly </s>
<s> i ll probably gift that out and find another router that will run openwrt </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i was wondering if you managed to resolve this problem </s>
<s> while i noticed these posts are from 2008 i just purchased the same router it s doing the exact same thing </s>
<s> i did a firmware upgrade via the router before i started using it but will attempt a manual download of the latest showing 1 28 2010 well after this post after a rest to see if that aids </s>
<s> clearly it s frustrating since the modem works fine directly </s>
<s> as for shutting off the wireless that s not an option </s>
<s> even though i prefer a wired network i still have devices i like to roam around the house and building untethered </s>
<s> i only upgraded my current router for the 10 100 1000 hope there was a solution </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the 834 was gifted and a newer wnr2000 is now running for so long i ve forgotten how long it was since the power was lost to it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m sorry i thought the original problem was the d link dir 655 router </s>
<s> have you got that one working properly </s>
<s> you have to reply up higher </s>
<s> as to the 655 unless they try it per this forum s suggestions i doubt it was resolved </s>
<s> i ve seen this problem and if the settings we suggest don t work we swap out the router </s>
<s> i m unsure why some folk dig it their heels at that suggestion </s>
<s> very strange </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i believe i replied to the wrong individual below in this discussion however my question was whether the problem for the d link dir 655 router has been solved </s>
<s> i too am having the same problems </s>
<s> while i have not tried manually downloading the latest firmware which appears to be 1 28 2010 well pas thist post date i will i just thought i d ask now before i get home to test this option out and since i did not see a resolution or quot i got it quot </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> has limits to the depth of the discussion </s>
<s> make a new post or reply up to for replies </s>
<s> yes i have fixed a few 655s </s>
<s> either with the settings noted in this forum s sticky or by sending it back for another </s>
<s> i m unsure why this answer is not acceptable to some </s>
<s> could you tell why </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> quot i have not tried manually downloading the latest firmware quot that is one of the items covered in this forum s sticky </s>
<s> and has helped many times </s>
<s> but here s the deal </s>
<s> why would we not use the ideas and methods that has worked so often </s>
<s> and if we find it doesn t work why would would keep a cranky router </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well by manually downloading the firmware and manually uploading it to the router that made some differences </s>
<s> technical support and information latest firmware as of download </s>
<s> 12 is typical of the internet connection speeds </s>
<s> if you get 12 megabits per second from the internet you re doing great </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ve never received anything above 8mbps and that is tops </s>
<s> i just had a conversation with comcast this morning to vent a little </s>
<s> it s frustrating that no matter where i ve lived i ve never gotten what i pay for </s>
<s> and of course they have no problem taking payment for no or lack of service </s>
<s> i guess i can t complain to much at least it s fast enough to stream hd movies to my tv </s>
<s> that s the big deal </s>
<s> then again if rush hour traffic hits in my building then i ll end up with a butt load of buffers </s>
<s> that speed is typically all over the map but if there is a lesson about connections over wifi is to get wired if you want the best possible speeds </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i totally agree </s>
<s> that s why i upgraded the router for a gigabit wired connection </s>
<s> but the wireless is essential for remote services like our phones pods laptops guests that are not near the wall etc </s>
<s> wireless is totally convenient but i opt for wired as well whenever possible </s>
<s> all my desktops are wired my tv is wired my bd player is wired etc </s>
<s> that alone makes streaming movies and music through our new samsung products and dlna products a dream 8mbps or 12 and gigabit if local </s>
<s> clearly 12mbps would be better especially during peak traffic hours </s>
<s> i found that when an iphone or other things are in the brew the shared airspace may pull back to 802 11b speeds </s>
<s> to fix this i move the router to 802 11g only mode and if i need a wifi link to a hdtv set i may even use a second dedicated wifi router as a wap </s>
<s> we discuss that in the top posts of this forum </s>
<s> new idea </s>
<s> set the router to 802 11g only </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that makes perfect sense </s>
<s> while i did make multiple adjustments to the router so i m not 100 what fixed it we do have all the portables and since they are not n compatible the weaker of the link is probably tuggin on the chain </s>
<s> setting that to b and g only probably did make the difference </s>
<s> well if i can transfer the big things fast over the lan then i ll be happy and get at least 8mpbs or much more than the sad 1 2mpbs for net </s>
<s> thanks for the org post and hope all this helps out any newcomers </s>
<s> i ll have to setup my second old perfectly working 10 100 router as a wifi ap so the speeds don t fight </s>
<s> great suggestion </s>
<s> i have the same problem </s>
<s> i rma d mine and the new one is exactly the same </s>
<s> speed test with old d link router di 604 speed test with new d link dir 655 actually had a tech guy look at it and he can t explain it </s>
<s> he said the router is defective </s>
<s> i m just going to send it back and go with something i can put dd wrt on </s>
