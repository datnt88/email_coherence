<s> the m7330n which is going to be more than you need it sounds like pretty much any modern computer will take care of what you re looking to do </s>
<s> with that in mind i would weigh the customer service a little more heavily rather than pick over the feature hardware differences between comparable models </s>
<s> whatever you end up with either a it ll work and you ll be happy or b something will go wrong and you ll be on the phone with support </s>
<s> for what it worth online hp support has been good </s>
<s> you can chat online and they ll email you a transcript of the conversation in case you should forget anything that was mentioned </s>
<s> having bought many computers i decided to give a hp pavillion a try and have been very disappointed with it </s>
<s> from the very begining i was misled not being informed that the pavillion a1310n i bought came with no operating system cd s and they will not provide them </s>
<s> i have software that hp preinstalls with the operating system that can not be totaly removed </s>
<s> i have gone through the add remove programs to uninstall the garbage but some such as norton keep coming back with popups telling me to update </s>
<s> i have pleaded with hp reps for a os cd so i can have a clean install to no avail </s>
<s> i have since bought a dell and will recomend people don t buy a hp for the reasons stated </s>
<s> they do not have the policy that the customer is always right and even agree that my complaints are valid but will not rectify the problem </s>
<s> i will tell everyone looking to buy to pass on hp </s>
<s> i am getting the runaround from hp on obtaining the vista upgrade they promised me </s>
<s> instead of automatically sending you the upgrade when ready they force you to prove yourself to a 3rd party order fulfillment house which is inept and incompetent </s>
<s> i wouldn t trust them now with the purchase of an ink cartridge </s>
<s> once you get your pc home you ll have to deal with support from a call center in india which is staffed by idiots reading from a script </s>

<s> i m having same problems as bobborn with dell </s>
<s> well having said that who would you now buy a new pc from if not from dell or hp </s>
<s> my last desktop was a dell and i just bought an hp at a good price </s>
<s> truthfully i ve heard horror stories about both companies tech support but i ve never had a major problem with either </s>
<s> we have a corporate discount with dell at work so i know lots of people who have dells </s>
<s> think when you get a decent one you re ok but it s hard to get help on a problem of any significance </s>
<s> btw my dell machine worked fine but at after a few years needed upgrades that would ve knocked a big hole in the cost of a new one </s>
<s> the few times i ve called tech support for dell or hp it really wasn t about a major issue </s>
<s> i didn t find them real helpful but was able to get help elsewhere </s>
<s> a custom built machine at a local store </s>
<s> it seems easier when i need serious help for defective hardware </s>
<s> i trust i can solve software problems myself so i don t need a helpdesk for that </s>

<s> have you recently purchased any of dell s new desktops with the amd processors </s>

<s> is your dell one of the new dell dimension 521 desktop models or is it an older dell dimension desktop model </s>
