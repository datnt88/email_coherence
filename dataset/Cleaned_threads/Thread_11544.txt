<s> does any one know how i can transfer the program files and data from my old 10g hd with xp home edition on it to a different pc with a 20g hd on it </s>
<s> the 20g hd presently has windows 2000 pro on it which i assume i will need to reformat </s>
<s> i have norton ghost 9 0 if i was to plug the 10g hd to this computer would i be able to do a drive to drive transfer </s>
<s> is it possible that xp being a newer os than 2000 would have the mb drivers needed for this computer to reconize the old xp hd </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> it s quite possible to copy the entire drive from the 10 gig to the 20 with ghost or other such software </s>
<s> as such all data is intact </s>
<s> however xp will not startup on the new hardware </s>
<s> you will need the original installation cd and will need to perform a quot repair quot installation </s>
<s> you will also need the product id code and will be required to reactivate windows </s>
<s> it s possible that xp will know much of your hardware but probably not all of it </s>
<s> gather all the drivers first </s>
<s> this would also be a good time to visit the web sites of all your hardware manufacturers and get the latest drivers </s>
<s> definately get the latest bios for the mb while you re at it </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> you know i ve never use norton ghost but for certain i could tell you how i resolved such problem </s>
<s> when i bought new pc at first i wanted to keep my old hdd as it has much needed data but it was only 40gb </s>
<s> so i after long searches i found clone disk software </s>
<s> it s the easiest and most convenient backup program </s>
<s> i just create an exact image of my hdd and make a bootable cd due to highest level compression it takes not much space </s>
<s> and recover cloned hdd onto new pc automatically </s>
<s> if you ll use the same way you needn t reinstall windows and you ll automatically create pretty full backup of whole your system </s>
<s> only after restoring you ll have to download upgrades for new pc configuration </s>
<s> i m not sure of how this would work </s>
<s> do i need to reformat the hdd then start it with a bootable cd then put in the clone cd and do a repair install </s>
<s> i m confused </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> as i know acronis bootable cd doesn t demand to format the hdd as it installs clone over your old system and if you format your hdd nothing terrible will happen </s>
<s> also it doesn t matter what is your new one hdd size just it mustn t be smaller then your old one </s>
