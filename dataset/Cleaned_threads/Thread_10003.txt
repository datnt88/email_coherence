<s> i want to upgrade my mother board because i have found that i have an off brand and i would like to upgrade my video card </s>
<s> i don t however want to have to buy new memory or a processor </s>
<s> i have an intel pentium 2 6 ghz processor </s>
<s> and i have ddr sdram </s>
<s> does anyone know what mother board i could get </s>
<s> can ddr and ddr2 dimm ram run in the same motherboard </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> there are boards that have both type sockets but none allow installing more than 1 type </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok so is ddr sdram the same as just ddr </s>

<s> what motherboard do you already have </s>
<s> what video card do you already have </s>
<s> what do you want to be able to do with the new video card </s>
<s> download and run cpu z cpuid com to learn the manufacturer name and model number of your current motherboard </s>
<s> you should have a socket 478 cpu with a northwood core confirm this with cpu z </s>
<s> that means you need to start your search by looking at socket 478 motherboards that support a p4 not just core solo or core duo cpus </s>
<s> i only knew of three socket 478 p4 motherboards that had a pci express slot they weren t the greatest boards and they are getting difficult to find these days </s>
<s> you should still be able to find some good boards with i865 or i875 chipsets and agp 8x video slots </s>
<s> another option that will allow you to keep your ddr memory is to move to a socket 939 amd cpu motherboard but if you are going to spend that much money i d just bite the bullet and build a complete core 2 duo system </s>
<s> got to this site via google </s>
<s> hope someone can help </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
