<s> i installed a brother mfc 420cn successfully on my netgear wireless router that both my ibook and windows me pc can see </s>
<s> but after installation a brother hl 1435 laser printer and an hp photoprinter 1100 quot stopped quot according to printer setup utility in os x panther </s>
<s> i tried reinstalling the brother laser driver but the ibook doesn t see it under usb in printer setup utility </s>
<s> any suggestions would be appreciated </s>

<s> when the print queue is quot stopped quot all that needs to be done is to quot start quot it again </s>
<s> on the menubar or the icon bar of the printer window </s>
<s> occasionally you will find a document that the printer just gives up on </s>
<s> at that point it stops the queue </s>
<s> deleting the offending document and restarting the queue usually works </s>
<s> this is probably not the problem in your case </s>

<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> both local usb printers show quot stopped quot even though i was only trying to print to one when this started </s>
<s> restarting the document just seemed to put it back in the queue but it would eventually stop as before </s>
<s> also tried restarting computer </s>
<s> deleting both printers and trying to reinstall one doesn t work as printer setup utility no longer sees any usb drivers </s>
<s> interesting </s>
<s> even after running the installer for a printer it no longer sees that printer </s>
<s> do a search for all files that contain the name of the offending printer even a partial name and delete everything found </s>
<s> reinstall </s>
<s> you say that after quot starting quot again the document just goes back in the queue and the queue stops </s>
<s> did you try deleting the document and starting with a an empty print spooler </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> i tried every combination of deleting document and deleting printer and reinstalling driver restarting print document </s>
<s> what s most interesting is that not one but two local usb printers were quot stopped quot after installation of network printer </s>
<s> no document was being printed to one of those usb printers only the laser </s>
<s> yet printer setup utility shows both quot stopped quot are you suggesting i search for files with names of either usb printer and delete them </s>
<s> that quot should quot ensure that a fresh installation will actually put the drivers onto the disk instead of just checking to see if the drivers have the same date </s>
<s> worth a try it is curious that both usb printers should stop though p </s>
