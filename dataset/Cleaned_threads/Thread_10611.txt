<s> so here is my problem </s>
<s> i bought a asus n6600 and it ran fine for about a day and then basically anything 3d heavy looked like this i thought it was the card so i sent it back and recieved a new one same model a week later </s>
<s> no change </s>
<s> i can only assume its my computer since i tested it on my friend s computer and it was fine </s>
<s> what could be the problem </s>
<s> a friend suggested it was overheating but whenever i check the gpu is always under 40c usually the same for the cpu </s>
<s> this is really starting to bother me </s>
<s> what is causing this </s>
<s> i have a p4 2 20ghz with a gig of ram </s>
<s> my motherboard is a gigabyte ga 8s650gxm i can post full spec report if needed also yes i have every driver posssible and everything updateable updated </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> running any tweak tools for your graphics card eg ati tray tool </s>
<s> what card is it </s>
<s> like i said in the post its an asus n6600 nivida 6600 i m not using anything to tweak my card the only thing i ve got is the drivers off nvidia s site </s>
<s> note if you re asking for technical help please be sure to include all your system info including operating system model number and any other specifics related to the problem </s>
<s> power supply </s>
<s> how many watts </s>
<s> i ve got a 350w power supply some no name brand </s>
<s> on the day after you installed it and it failed </s>
<s> new drivers other software hardware anything </s>
<s> if yes revert back to that day and add them in one at a time </s>
<s> if no look for a hardware problem </s>
<s> did your previous graphics card have a fan and draw power or is this a new load on that power supply </s>
<s> what size p s is your friend using </s>
<s> before i got this card i had a radeon 9200 se which had something wrong with it with it comp would constantly freeze even on other computers </s>
<s> it didnt have a fan this one does though </s>
<s> when i got the card i thought it might be the power supply so i changed the 250 watt with a 350 watt but it was pretty cheap and i ve heard it can cause problems </s>
<s> also yesterday i thought it might be the ram so i ran a momory test program and i got some interesting results </s>
<s> when i tested each stick of ram individually i got no errors but together i did get some </s>
<s> i tried running hl2 with just one stick and after 15 muinites or so it went haywire much like when using both sticks </s>
<s> so i dont think its the ram </s>
<s> with ram and video card ruled out i gues the power supply could be it </s>
<s> could it be the motherboard </s>
<s> can a software problem cause these types of severe graphical glitches see screenshot in first post </s>
<s> that the artifacting is caused by your psu </s>
<s> you may want to upgrade that </s>
<s> you can check this by looking at your current voltages in your bios or by downloading a program that will show you your current voltages </s>
<s> check your 12v </s>
<s> if it s running around 11 5 or lower then that is most likely the problem </s>
<s> i went into the boot menu thing and watched the voltages for about a min and this is what it looked like 3 3v was 3 29 or 3 31 5v was 5 16 12v was 12 09 or 12 16 or 12 22 </s>
