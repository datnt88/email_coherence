<s> just the other day i had to restart my computer after a crash while watching a movie </s>
<s> i had to use the power button since ctrl alt del didn t work </s>
<s> when the computer booted up again strange noises came from the harddrive almost sounded like some sort of sci fi raygun </s>
<s> i ve never encountered that one before so i was wondering if anyone had any advise for me on what to do </s>
<s> send it for repairs hum along with the noise or ignore it </s>
<s> or something </s>
<s> icaros </s>
<s> as long as there are no files you can t lose then i d ignore it then replace the drive when it fails </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the real question is where is the problem </s>
<s> i constantly hear people referring to their computer as their quot hard drive quot when the hard drive is just one small thing inside a computer </s>
<s> is the problem actually coming from the hard drive did you open up the case and see if the noise still happens if you unplug the power from the hard drive </s>
<s> usually you hear a noise from a fan in a system not the drive when a hard drive starts making a lot of noise it is almost always already toast due to a head crash and damage to the platters </s>
<s> when is the last time you backed up your system s data </s>
<s> any noice noticable coming from the hd isn t good but there s the outside chance it was trying to access a pgm file that maybe corrupted or fragmented and doing alot more work to do so </s>
<s> regardless do a backup asap just to be safe </s>
<s> goto the hd makers support website and get thier diags as that is the required process in order to proceed with any quot warranty quot returns provided you re still covered </s>
<s> even so the diags themselves will readily check the hd </s>
<s> if a problems exists use warranty or open wallet </s>
<s> if the problem seems to be a pgm file s reload them but a good hd defrag seems to be in order anyways just get that backup done as well </s>
