<s> i have a idotconnect metal gear box 3 5 quot hard drive </s>
<s> the box reads 3 5 quot ide to usb 2 0 1394a i lost the power adapter for this hard drive and all my stuff is on it it s 6 pin and it says quot dc in quot where it plugs in to the hard drive </s>
<s> i ve been googling this company the product the adapter i cant find anything with this pin layout is this a typo </s>
<s> i found something similar with the 5v and the gnd reversed see pic below </s>
<s> get a new enclosure </s>
<s> i owned a few of those speed metal drives and that enclosure is not special </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> having your link explains alot thanks </s>
<s> as robert offered replacing the enclosure would be the better fix quot if quot you can t find another ac wart </s>
<s> plus the cost may push you into getting a new enclosure anyways if you found one </s>
<s> i also consider this an unique adapter because of the dual voltages so it becomes harder to replace </s>
<s> check these links or google away for surplus or used parts vendors </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i just need to get the data off this hard drive first but i need to power it up </s>
<s> what should i be searching for </s>
<s> is there a specific name for this kind of adapter </s>
<s> and plug it into a port on your computer s motherboard </s>
<s> it should be either ide pata or sata if no port is available disconnect one from such as a cd rom or secondary hard drive </s>
<s> plug that drive in and pull off what you need </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> as explained to you the simple fix was to replace the enclosure </s>
<s> the new enclosure would have the required ac adapter </s>
<s> you swap hd out and then use the new enclosure to access data </s>
<s> once done you have the new enclosure as a working ext </s>
<s> hd again </s>
<s> if that doesn t work provided all was done correctly then you have some true or 2ndary fault to deal with </s>
<s> also steven s suggestion to gain access for data alone provided you have the required port and cabling use a desktop pc and mount it as an int </s>
<s> hd in proper setup </s>
<s> either way will work to gain access to data </s>
<s> try this one </s>
