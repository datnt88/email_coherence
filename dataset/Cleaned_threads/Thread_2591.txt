<s> i am trying to network 5 computers running windows xp pro </s>
<s> i am attempting to connect them through a dlink switch </s>
<s> i can t get the computers to see or access the other computers </s>
<s> i have run the network set up wizard many times </s>
<s> i have tried creating a new connection </s>
<s> i have tried with static ip and dynamic </s>
<s> i have gone in and enabled netbios over tcp ip in the connection properties </s>
<s> i have setup several other networks sucessfully and have no idea what i am doing wrong </s>
<s> any help will be appreciated </s>

<s> your ip plan and what firewalls are installed </s>
<s> hint some firewalls have a disable but still function while disabled so be sure yours has a true off setting </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t know that i have an ip plan </s>
<s> the only firewall currently installed is the windows firewall </s>
<s> this network will probably not have internet access </s>
<s> mike </s>
<s> without you implementing an ip plan such as setting the addresses or having a router with dhcp the networking should be less than happy </s>
<s> try assigning 192 168 0 10 to the first machine 192 168 0 11 to the next and so on </s>
<s> gt i don t duplicate web content on how to set this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks i ll give that a try </s>
<s> mike </s>
<s> if you have set up a network successfully before the switch may be faulty </s>
<s> check windows firewall running on all those 5 winxp pcs </s>
<s> its blocking ping other protocols </s>
<s> regards mangesh </s>
<s> i will check the firewall this evening </s>
<s> however i thought the process of running the network set up wizard was supposed to set the firewall properly </s>
<s> as fo the ip setup i have it set this way am i correct </s>
<s> main system ip 192 168 0 2 subnet 255 255 255 0 default gateway 192 168 0 2 preferred dns 192 168 0 2 second machine ip 192 168 0 3 subnet 255 255 255 0 default gateway 192 168 0 2 preferred dns 192 3168 0 2 i have also enabled netbios over ip </s>
<s> i am connecting the computers through a dlink switch model des1105 </s>
<s> note that this is a new switch being used to connect the computers </s>
<s> thanks for the help mike </s>
<s> did you install a dns server on that machine </s>
<s> and also why is that a gateway machine </s>
<s> is there some router software on it </s>
<s> also i noted to start at 192 168 0 10 while i can t write everything in this small space the reason is that if you installed some router later starting at 10 could avoid some headaches </s>
<s> your choice here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no real good reason just trying to work this out </s>
<s> now if the default ip address of the switch is 10 90 90 90 should i use that as the gateway and dns address </s>
<s> also should i use ip s in the range of say 10 90 90 </s>
<s> if so should the subnet be 255 0 0 0 </s>
<s> i seem to have just enough knowlege to have gotten myself into troube here and can t seem to get out </s>
<s> thanks for the help mike </s>
<s> ok i ve made a little progress but still not working properly </s>
<s> here s where i am trying to connect 2 computers ultimately 5 computers through a dlink switch computer a is xp pro staic ip 192 168 0 10 subnet mask 255 255 255 0 computer b is also xp pro static ip 192 168 0 11 subnet mask 255 255 255 o i have run the windows network setup wizard on both machines </s>
<s> if i open my network places on computer a i am able to see computer b </s>
<s> i am also able to access the folders and files in the shared files folder of computer b from computer a </s>
<s> however when i open my network places on computer b i do not see computer a </s>
<s> if i click on view workgroup computers i am able to see computer a </s>
<s> but when i click on the icon for computer a i receive an error that states computer a is not accessible i don t understand why i can access one computer but not the other </s>
<s> any help is again greatly appreciated mike </s>
<s> what i suggested would ease the migration if and when you installed a router </s>
<s> your choice here </s>
<s> it seems you need to think more about why you put in a dns and gateway setting </s>
<s> nothing in your posts suggests these are proper </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> 1 there is no matching quot account quot on some machine </s>
<s> 2 a firewall is active </s>
