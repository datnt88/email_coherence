<s> i started a small at home business of taking digital pictures of weddings family portraits school pictures and things like that </s>
<s> i am getting more shoots than i ever thought i would and my amd 4200 and 3 gigs of pc3200 ram is just too slow </s>
<s> i will be changing the mother board ram and cpu but don t know if i should be looking at a duel or quad core processor </s>
<s> it will be a intel and so far i have looked at a e8600 duel core processor </s>
<s> also my computer has the built in card reader does that make a difference </s>
<s> i am using a sandisk extreme iii cf card for the camera </s>
<s> i am running windows vista home premium and adobe cs3 any advise would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks wayne </s>
<s> but is the cpu the bottleneck </s>
<s> usually i discover people complain about the recording time to dvd or something else not cpu bound </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what happens in my case is i can take around 100 pictures put the card in the reader and it may take 10 minutes or so for them to all open so i can start editing them </s>
<s> then once i do the editing and click save it may take 20 to 30 sec before i can save each picture into a folder which takes another 20 to 30 sec </s>
<s> i don t count the time it takes for editing as i shoot in raw and i know that takes a little longer to process the pictures </s>
<s> you gave me advise awhile back about the 3 gig switch which did help but as i am doing more of this now i would like to get it done faster if possible </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> once i get all the pictures touched up i have no problem at all burning them to cd or dvd that part is very fast </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> copy them from the reader to the hard disk </s>
<s> opening them from the card could be the issue </s>
<s> i will try it that way next time and before i spend the money on the upgrade </s>
<s> wayne </s>
