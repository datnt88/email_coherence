<s> i recently replaced my psu and graphics card in my computer </s>
<s> everything was fine until the monitor started to act strange </s>
<s> i would turn on my computer and i could hear it was loading windows but the monitor will not display anything </s>
<s> sometimes i am able to turn of the computer and then turn it back on and it works but now it doesnt seem to want to do anything even though i was using it fine and hour or so before </s>
<s> is this problem being cause by my new graphics card or psu r is it another issue </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> mabey you should try it with a different computer </s>
<s> that d narrow it down </s>
<s> my monitor not displaying anything isn t a question </s>
<s> output of new power supply maybe not enough to support all your drives and the new graphics card graphics card power connector is there one </s>
<s> cooling does your card require a better cooling system </s>
<s> monitor if it s a flatscreen it should have a built in powersaving function with a screensaver </s>
<s> if that displays correctly when disconnected from the card but nothing shows up on your screen when plugged into the card it could be one of two things </s>
<s> either the graphics card isn t sending a signal to your monitor or it s sending a different type of signal </s>
<s> make sure your monitor is set to digital if you re using dvi or analog if you re using vga </s>
<s> try booting into safe mode </s>
<s> if it works fine in safe mode you might want to try replacing the drivers for the card </s>
