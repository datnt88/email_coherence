<s> i just bought this camera easy to install but image quality is horrible </s>
<s> anyone has some tricks in this regard </s>
<s> may be the best trick is to return it </s>
<s> some compare such to digital cameras which surveillance cameras rarely compete with </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> standard television is equivilent to 320x240 resolution </s>
<s> this typically looks pretty poor on a full screen monitor </s>
<s> 30 frames per second is considered real time video </s>
<s> most of the video capture cards clame 640x480 resolution and 30 fps but they separate these as 2 different line items </s>
<s> you usually get 640x480 at 15 fps or 320x240 at 30 fps </s>
<s> you can save bandwidth by reducing to 25fps </s>
<s> you should compare these numbers with your camera specs </s>
<s> if it uses a standard lens you may be able to swap that out and improve the picture quality </s>
<s> skrall </s>
<s> more than likely the resoulution of this camera is either 320x240 or 640x480 </s>
<s> the 640 may not look that bad but if it is a 320 it would look terrible on a computer screen </s>
<s> i think d link makes a similar camera that has better specs than the linksys might be worth checking out </s>
<s> good luck </s>
