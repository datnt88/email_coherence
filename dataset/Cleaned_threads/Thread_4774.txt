<s> it seems that your drivers are incorrect and or the hardware is not compatible with your os </s>
<s> what os are you using </s>
<s> have you tried to update the driver directly from device manager </s>
<s> if you bought the modem new it should have come with a driver disk </s>
<s> hi i have win98 yes the modem did come with the drivers on cd but i have gone crazy trying to fu igure out why i have this missinf file after installing them </s>
<s> i have tryed to update the driver in device manager but still receive the error when the computer boots up to the desktop </s>
<s> the error that i am getting is the msvcp60 dll file is linked to missing export msvcrt dll_ic_collate_cp the modem never shows up in the device manager only the pci enumerator problem </s>
<s> it s either or something like it </s>
<s> thanks everyone i have tryed everything and it still has problems so i went and bought a different modem and that one installed no problem </s>
