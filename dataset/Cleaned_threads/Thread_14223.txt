<s> zip 100 usb with win xp for some reason one of my zip disks refuses to be recognised by windows explorer </s>
<s> it comes up insert disk or protected </s>
<s> right clicking on any of my zip disks will not give me the protect unprotect option </s>
<s> i have downloaded the latest software from iomega but no difference </s>
<s> could this be a dodgy disk </s>
<s> when i right click this disk and look at properties it says 0 bytes and a file system of raw </s>
<s> any sugestions on recovering this disk </s>
<s> pick over to see if you find an answer but media doesn t last forever bob </s>
<s> zip drives used to come with software on one of zip disks in the bundle </s>
<s> this disk was the tools disk and was protected as it had the installation software on it </s>
<s> included was a utility to quot unlock quot the disk so you could use it like any other </s>
<s> is it possible this could be one of those protected disks </s>
<s> if so iomega software utilities might be able to unlock it </s>
<s> just a thought good luck </s>
