<s> is there a huge performance difference speed wise between a 2x1gb ddr2 667mhz sdram and a 2x1gb ddr2 800mhz </s>
<s> how will windows vista ultimate run on either of these </s>
<s> i ask this question because the difference in the price is too high </s>
<s> tia </s>
<s> it s a nice up but you should research tomshardware com to see if he has some machines with that difference </s>
<s> for laptops i head to reviews and benchmarks </s>
<s> same for desktops </s>
<s> however since no make or models were shared i can only note that there could be cpu differences as well since that sets that rate in most if not all machines </s>

<s> thanks for the quick reply </s>
<s> i am sorry that i didn t provide you with proper details </s>
<s> i plan on buying a low end locally assembled desktop </s>
<s> the processor i am currently interested in is an intel core 2 duo 2 13ghz e6420 1066fsb </s>
<s> also it will have an ati pcie x16 radeon x1300 pro 256mb graphics card to go with it </s>
<s> so my questions are as follows 1 will an 800mhz 2x1gb ram make a huge difference as opposed to a 667mhz 2x1gb one </s>
<s> 2 how big is the difference between a 2 13ghz core 2 duo 1066fsb e6420 and a 1 86ghz core 2 duo 1066fsb e6320 speed wise </s>
<s> it s all about the money </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it s just a simple 800 divided by 677 result </s>
<s> i can t tell if you call that quot big quot </s>
<s> other areas will not be affected such as hard disk transfer rate triangle fill rates etc </s>
<s> nice cpus with 4m l2 cache so benchmarks should be easy to find on those and should be as easy as 2 13 divided by 1 86 results </s>
<s> i have the 2 13 but with 2m cache and the real bonus on my new versus my old system is the non gaming power draw is now 100 watts and the old machine run at 200 watts </s>
