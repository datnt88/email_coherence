<s> i just purchased a kensington 33085 usb bluetooth adapter off ebay </s>
<s> the drivers are only for xp so how am i supposed to install this pos on 64 bit vista </s>
<s> i m lost </s>
<s> did you go to and download kensington bluetooth usb adapter 2 0 rev </s>
<s> 5 1 0 1700 and rev </s>
<s> 6 0 1 5100 </s>
<s> this is a 30 day trial </s>
<s> how do i go around that </s>
<s> it works now but it wont in 30 days </s>
<s> any others that are free no trials </s>
<s> if you think they are please get your money back </s>
<s> the toshiba bluetooth managaer says it is only a 30 day trial </s>
<s> so yes the drivers will still work after 30 days but how do i transfer files without a manager file transfer app </s>
<s> i must be missing something all i want to do i transfer files between my cell phone </s>
<s> i m thinking the usb cord is faster and more efficient </s>
<s> you want to buy a dongle that comes with all things vista </s>
<s> here i didn t install the quot manager quot but use vista s native bluetooth manager </s>
<s> sorry but i don t duplicate web content or help content included with the os </s>
<s> i only fill in the hard to find items </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m not stupid i have a dell studio 540 i purchased recently and it s running 64 bit vista premium </s>
<s> when i go to control panal hardware and sound all i get is bluetooth local com which is not a bluetooth wizard just a list of com ports </s>
<s> if i search for bluetooth wizard i get no result </s>
<s> it is also not in the accessories file like everyone says </s>
<s> when i run fsquirt exe i get an error saying windows cannot find it </s>
<s> how do i not have the wizard where can i get it </s>
<s> if not you ask dell where they hid it </s>
<s> that is if they supplied the oem version of the os </s>
