<s> so after 6 years of ownership of a now sluggish and ancient dell dimension e520 i ve decided it s easier to run a clean install of vista to boost performance rather than bother with uninstalling programs etc </s>
<s> my question is should i still use the 250 gb seagate barracuda 7200 10 hard drive that came with the system </s>
<s> or am i rolling the dice by doing a fresh install on a drive that old </s>
<s> i bought a new wd 1tb 7200 caviar blue to add as a 2nd drive for storage but now i m wondering if i should use it instead as my primary drive and use the 6 year old drive for extra storage </s>
<s> what do you all think </s>
<s> if you had no real issue with your old hd then do as you plan use it as extra storage </s>
<s> using the new hd install it using the s w that came with it or the support website of s w you get free </s>
<s> that way you can swap data over from old gt new hd and needn t do a fresh install </s>
<s> of course you can skip that and do a fresh install then use only the new hd </s>
<s> just run it for several weeks and decide if you want to add the old hd </s>
<s> however if you get an ext </s>
<s> usb case that accepts that old hd you can go that route </s>
<s> the whole idea of swapping data from old to new is you will need to get all the updates etc to complete the install if a freshly done one but that s up to you </s>
<s> your new hd guide or manual to include any visit to support website should provide details on all this </s>
<s> i tend to install data to new hd alone and run it for awhile maybe a month or more </s>
<s> keeping the old hd as a safeguard of data stored in a safe place </s>
<s> that way should it boo boo you have your old hd to fall back on on that date </s>
<s> again that s all up to you </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> that s solid advice thanks for your help </s>
