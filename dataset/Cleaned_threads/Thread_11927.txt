<s> i am being forced to buy a new desktop due to my roomate recently moving out </s>
<s> he plans to pick up his pc this weekend and i don t know how long i can go with out access to the web </s>
<s> i m addicted </s>
<s> seriously though i need some advice on the right system for me </s>
<s> what i know about computers i have learned on the web and from a few magazines i have read recently </s>
<s> i do have a basic understanding of the internal components of a pc and what each of them do </s>
<s> but by no means am i a computer quot pro quot </s>
<s> i will be mainly using the pc for surfing the web storing printing my pics downloading burning music and burning dvd s would be cool too </s>
<s> i don t play games on the computer </s>
<s> that is what my ps2 is for </s>
<s> i thought that a media center would be a good fit for me i m a long time home theater buff but from what i ve read picture quality is lacking </s>
<s> so i plan to keep my new pc separate from my a v setup for now </s>
<s> what i m looking for is a reliable computer without all of the extra stuff i don t need </s>
<s> that could be upgraded in the future if i want </s>
<s> i thought that a package from one of the big manufacturers would be good for me </s>
<s> however from what reviews i have read it doesn t seem that they are all that trouble free </s>
<s> it seems that even though most of these systems have some sort of tech support </s>
<s> dealing with these folks is a less than desireable event </s>
<s> as far as a budget i would like to stay under 1k </s>
<s> please give me some insight on your experiences with what you think would be a problem free setup </s>
<s> try ibuypower tiger direct american computech </s>
<s> have tech support here in the usa </s>
<s> these seem to be stores not manufacturers </s>
<s> here is a link to a forum about this process </s>
<s> also included some other links to look for parts </s>
<s> here are some parts resellers </s>
<s> here are a few links for product info </s>
<s> try to buy only quot retail quot parts and no quot oem quot parts </s>
<s> most quot oem quot parts have firmware and or drivers made for there designed systems </s>
<s> also quot oem quot parts come with no paperwork </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
