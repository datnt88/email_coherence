<s> so i ve been going around the internet for a couple hours now trying to find some decent ram that s compatible with my motherboard asus m4a77td what i m looking for is something along the lines of 8 12gb 1600mhz ddr3 60 80 i have 4 slots available to use </s>
<s> i just picked up 12gb of corsair vengeance ram only to find out that it won t work with what i have </s>
<s> the other problem is that i ve found a few items that do work with my asus but are all out of stock at tigerdirect newegg etc </s>
<s> strange value </s>
<s> how did you arrive at that </s>
<s> it seems all the ddr3 memory stick comes in 2 4gb each and the board have 4 sockets </s>
<s> did you happen to get some 3gb ram or some spares that you want to use </s>
<s> the prices are so reasonable i probably would not want to mix them </s>
<s> take a look at mwave or fry s </s>
<s> pick one </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> i m guessing this is decent ram at the least </s>
<s> ahtoi the stock ram was 2 2gb sticks while the corsair was 3 4gb sticks </s>
