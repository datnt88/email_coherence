<s> first off i have never dealed with power supplies before </s>
<s> the specs of my system are 512 mb ram 2 5 ghz pentium 4 80 gb hard drive </s>
<s> it s decent for what i need </s>
<s> anyway i went to class this morning i m a college student and i turned it off before i left </s>
<s> when i returned i went to turn it on and it didn t respond </s>
<s> i tried flipping the switch in the back didn t work flipped it back didn t work unplugged it for 20 minutes then came back and tried it again didn t work </s>
<s> there is a small red switch on the back one way says 15 the other says 230 on my power supply </s>
<s> i tried flipping that didn t work </s>
<s> my computer is a northgate i 1 power supply is an iso 300 and my computer won t turn on </s>
<s> someone help me please </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a 300 watt unit is on the small side but may be ok unless the machine was upgraded from what it came with </s>
<s> the 15 is more likely 115 this and the 220 is the voltage input selection </s>
<s> 220 will not be proper for most of us </s>
<s> if you feel its the power supply then you can find 450 watt units or larger do not skimp </s>
<s> for not much money at newegg com compgeeks com and other places </s>
<s> be sure to see if the ac cord powers up something else and that the power button is not defective </s>
<s> here s how i test such 1 first unplug the ac </s>
<s> 2 set it back to 115 3 open the case and follow the power on button wires to the motherboard </s>
<s> unplug just that and rember where it went to on the mainboard </s>
<s> 4 apply the ac flip the power supply to on then use a metal pen tip or such conductive item to short the two pins that the power on switch went to </s>
<s> what happens </s>
<s> be alert since nothing is typical of a dead supply while a twitch of the fans may indicate other dead parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> are there any fans running when you hit the power switch button on the front of your case </s>
<s> if not then i would suspect the power supply died </s>
<s> you can find replacements online or at circuit city best buy </s>
<s> if you need help selecting one please let me know and i can do some research for you </s>
<s> ok actually i know what to do with your computer </s>
<s> actually i also see this problem last 2 months </s>
<s> i think u should buy a regulator </s>
<s> because regulator can monitor our computer </s>
