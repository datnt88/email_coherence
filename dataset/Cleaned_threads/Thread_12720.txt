<s> hi i picked up this monitor from a local goodwill for about 20 </s>
<s> it didn t have a power supply so i ordered a replacement not from hp from another vendor </s>
<s> the one i got is rated at 12v 5a and it worked fine </s>
<s> but after a day i discovered the backlight power failure issue that apparently plagues these monitors </s>
<s> discovered the thread here and though most of the solutions pointed to problems in hp s power supply i wanted to see if anyone has a suggestion if i m using a new non hp power supply </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> provided the ps falls into the same specs as the old hp one did there shouldn t be a problem </s>
<s> the issue on this forum that users had were bad quot inverters quot located within the lcd itself not the ps </s>
<s> the inverter had poor manufacture or componets so they got whacked </s>
<s> the reply of that same monitor also provided links to fixes and repairs that could be made or at least point to the problem area </s>
<s> this needs some disassembly so if you re not capable then find a good repair center shop </s>
<s> that 20 lcd may not be a bargain after all </s>
<s> use the forum search engine to locate the topic </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks willy </s>
<s> time to get out the soldering iron </s>
<s> i m working on reading through that thread now but it s over 350 posts mostly furious customers posting their frustrating treatment at the hands of hp tech support so it s taking me a little while </s>
<s> believe me its worth looking to hit the one with the quot details and such quot and breakdown of the lcd case </s>
<s> i used hp 1703 and possibly hp 1503 similar to get those valuable tips hints fixes cures etc </s>
<s> via the forum search </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> here is a direct link that was founded via c net then on to a user that really started a blog </s>
<s> again good luck willy </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> unbelievable </s>
<s> if only fixing everything was that easy </s>
<s> the solder points on mine looked good but i put more on anyway 15 minutes and it was working perfectly </s>
