<s> my father is in the market for a color printer to print high quality pictures from a canon s60 </s>
<s> i would like to hear from people in this forum what they would suggest </s>
<s> right now we are looking at minolta magicolor 2430dl canon i960 epson stylus photo r800 and there are so many hp that i do not even know where to start though i will look at the photosmart 7960 </s>
<s> am i missing anything </s>
<s> as for price it is not a big concern he just wants quality prints </s>
<s> i have pictures from epson c42 s and up on the walls at the office and home </s>
<s> would that be good enough </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> quality looks like it came from your local photo shop walmart drug store etc and you would not be able to tell the difference </s>
<s> is that enough of a definition </s>
<s> i d have to use the glossy paper </s>
<s> i don t use the glossy paper since it s under glass or acrylic </s>
<s> in closing it does not look like what comes from walmart since its a slightly differenct technology </s>
<s> but i will not go to said walmart since its great stuff </s>
<s> if you want exactly what walmart would look like then you can not use an ink jet </s>
<s> you ll look at dye sublimation printers </s>
<s> if that s what you want </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my understanding although i don t claim to be an expert is that while many quot home quot printers do a very nice job printing photos on glossy or matte photo paper the ink isn t the same as photo processing ink and eventually your home printed photos will fade </s>
<s> which is to say the pictures will fade faster than if you had them professionally processed </s>
<s> having said that back up your home photos on cds make your glossy prints and if you have to print them again in 5 or 10 years so be it </s>
<s> in my humble opinion the ability to crop and adjust the photos is such a big plus it outweighs any issue of permanence </s>
<s> my hp officejet 5510 all in one does terrific photos </s>
<s> i wish the cost of ink cartridges were lower but such is life </s>
