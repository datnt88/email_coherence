<s> my roommate bought a new wireless router installed it on his desktop and it worked fine </s>
<s> then when he shutdown his computer the signal cut out for the router and when the computer is turned back on the connection stays off </s>
<s> so far the only way to get it working again is to re install every time </s>
<s> the router is still on it s just everyone loses connection when the desktop turns off and we can t figure out why </s>
<s> he s using windows vista sp2 and the router is a d link xtreme n gigabit router </s>
<s> could you let us know how exactly the wireless router fits into your network </s>
<s> is it connected this way </s>
<s> internet gt modem gt wireless router gt desktop or is it configured differently </s>
<s> is there another router in the mix somewhere </s>
<s> there shouldn t be any need to reinstall anything on the pc to get the wireless working for others </s>
<s> i m assuming that a simple reboot of the router doesn t work </s>
<s> it s connected as you said internet gt modem gt wireless router gt desktop and rebooting it didn t work either </s>
<s> are you losing the actual wireless signal </s>
<s> no signal strength on the laptops and does the wlan light on the router go off </s>
<s> if that s the case then i m thinking the router is faulty or possibly the nic in your desktop is bad </s>
<s> test by connecting a laptop by wire to the router and turn it off as you did with the desktop </s>
<s> if the problem reoccurs then it s likely the router is bad </s>
<s> if you are just losing access to your network wireless still operates but can t access resources internet then it s likely some kind of configuration problem </s>
<s> you may want to refer to the forum sticky for network setup tips </s>
<s> it s the router that has the issue </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
