<s> i have been searching cnet s site for a basic how to for a non computer literate person getting their first computer </s>
<s> one that can take the newbie through the steps starting wth taking the computer out of the box and setting it up through the first time it is powered on and also covering the basic maintenance steps to take from the start to keep the computer operating at its optimum for the longest possible time things like the best free antivirus back up methods especially and other general stuff for optimum performance and health </s>
<s> it needs to explain things in step by step form and assume the newbie knows nothing </s>
<s> is there such information on this site that is all in the same place </s>
<s> i am desperate for a how to here so that i do not have to try and explain it all for several reasons </s>
<s> firstly because the person that needs it will take no notice of what i say and also because i don t actually know it all well enought to explain it in a coherent manner </s>
<s> if it doesn t already exist how do i find the right person here at cnet to try and set up a page like what i am after </s>
<s> begging for help tizzanne </s>
<s> the best antivirus question has been posted dozens of times in the spyware forum </s>
<s> keeping the machine quot optimal quot must be some dozen times in the computer help forum </s>

<s> think about all the variables </s>
<s> think about all the subjective areas </s>
<s> think about all the pc fix it types that would be out of business if joe average learned how to change the oil very bad the info your looking for exists but it s scattered all over the place </s>

<s> i know all the info i want is out there it just doesn t seem to be collated in the one place and the person i am looking for it for is lazy and a little slow on grasping complicated things </s>
<s> if it is not in the one place she will not bother doing any of it and it is for her kids safety and future benefit that i want to try and get her into the good habits from the start </s>
<s> as i said she won t take a lot of notice of me she reckons if i know it it can t be right but she sets great store in cyber world and thinks that if it says so online it must be right regardless of where it actually comes from </s>
<s> she is the type to fall for a nigerian scam </s>
<s> so i hope you can see where my problem lies </s>
<s> i do know i will be the one she comes crying to when things go wrong but i am only a relative novice myself and don t know how to get out of existing problems only how to try and avoid them in the first place and that knowlege base is probably incomplete too lol </s>
<s> that s why i was hoping there was a beginners guide to refer her to so she might at least get some good info to set her up </s>
