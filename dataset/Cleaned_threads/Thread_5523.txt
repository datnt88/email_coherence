<s> for a while my computer would stop dead </s>
<s> screen would freeze keyboard wouldnt respond i couldnt even turn it off by holding down the power button </s>
<s> now im lucky to get it to do anything </s>
<s> a few times while changing out ram i got a boot screen indicating a change in memory but then it would freeze again </s>
<s> ive tried my video card and power supply in another computer and they are fine </s>
<s> ive disconneced everything but the ram hard drive and video card no onboard </s>
<s> ive even tried without the hard drive and ive switched ram around </s>
<s> any every time i get no response </s>
<s> if i have the keyboard plugged in it will light up at the very first moment of powering up but even after several minutes it will not respond </s>
<s> so a assume its a motherboard processor problem </s>
<s> i was wondering what things i can do to troubleshoot </s>
<s> im actually okay with one of them being a problem because ive been meaning to replace them </s>
<s> but i would like to be sure that would fix it first </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> but that symptom is consistent with the bad caps plague google bad caps </s>
<s> not only you but a lot of members are leaving out details which makes any reply just a bad guess </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ll look in to that </s>
<s> in the mean time what other details should i include </s>
<s> watch as you post for the words in red </s>
<s> i m running windows xp pro sp2 </s>
<s> i have a pentium4 3 ghz i think </s>
<s> motherboard intel d915gav </s>
<s> 2 512 600mhz corsair memory sticks </s>
<s> ati x1050 pcie video card </s>
<s> westerndigital 80gb hdd </s>
<s> and corsair hx520w psu </s>
<s> i ve been testing all my components in another computer </s>
<s> everything seems fine psu ram video card hard drive </s>
<s> and i ve tried the ram and psu from the other computer and i get the same results </s>
<s> when i put the other computers ram in my computer i did again manage to get the motherboard boot screen telling me about the change in ram </s>
<s> but it froze again at this point </s>
<s> and i can t get that screen back again </s>
<s> i ve gotten it about 3 times out of at least 40 or 50 boot ups </s>
<s> if i ve got a case of bad caps it s not apparant </s>
<s> everything looks okay and no smells </s>
<s> but from what i read that doesn t rule it out </s>
<s> the symptoms are consistent with bad caps missing heatsink compound and just bad boards </s>
<s> but remember there were never any diagnostics to test it down to the board so we use the story and inspect the caps to give our diagnosis the best results </s>
<s> sounds like a bum board </s>
