<s> hello i m having a heck of a time trying to find myself a udma mode 6 enabled motherboard to run ssd </s>
<s> unfortunately i cannot find the udma mode listed on many motherboard specification sheets </s>
<s> asus recommened that i check out the p9x79 motherboard </s>
<s> currently i am running a asus p7p55d e lx which is listed as having 2x 6 gbs sata ports </s>
<s> however udma 6 enabled ssd s are only being run udma 5 any tips on udma mode 6 motherboards would be great </s>
<s> i am willing to go with amd or intel preferably intel cpus along with it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> so it appears udma 6 or ata133 is legacy </s>
<s> that is you catch that where you can but it s gone </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> not sure i m following you on this one proffitt </s>
<s> you lead off with udma 6 or ata 133 which is about ide ports </s>
<s> since new boards may not have said port trouble </s>
<s> why can t you use the newer sata ports and get a ssd on sata connections </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> given that a bios can emulate ide the drive is still sata folk may elect to use this emulation and get lost trying to up the udma mode when it s all an emulation </s>
<s> skip all this and set the sata to ahci without the emulation and we can chat about sata speeds </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the issue is that a 6 0 gb s sata port is quot supposed quot to read 400 mb s </s>
<s> if i m not mistaken when the ssd is running in udma 5 mode the read write speed is not testing it s full ability </s>
<s> i follow you on this unfortunately when ahci mode is enabled the pc gets on an endless cycle of boot and reboot while bsoding on the windows logo </s>
<s> enabled ahci mode computer booted up fine read write speeds seem to still be quot slower quot than advertised </s>
<s> i found ssd to be treacherous in that not only the drive firmware must be current but many machines require intel s rst app to hit full steam </s>
<s> then again the ssd maker can change the software to be more safe at the cost of some speed </s>
<s> and finally we have the problem of laboratory conditions </s>
<s> one poor soul had that cracked windows 7 and never could fix it </s>
<s> our theory is the crack wrecked havoc with the system </s>
<s> and since we could get full speed from our install they were pissed at everyone about quot what carp is this why can t you fix my system quot they were treated as nicely as possible but that os meant we could never tackle that system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> many forget the extra bytes in the packets flying around </s>
<s> this is why you want to talk to the maker s support of your machine and see what they think </s>
