<s> is this possible or am i dreaming </s>
<s> any guidence would be appreciated </s>
<s> have you researched wireless cam websites </s>
<s> it is possible though you may have to upgrade your equipment a bit </s>
<s> it also depends on impediments things in the way of signal but it is possible </s>
<s> you could always buy a small netbook plug the webcam to it </s>
<s> place the webcam connected to the netbook connected to the router in a house near a window </s>
<s> start up the webcam </s>
<s> when you want to view the webcam do a remote desktop connection protocol rdp to the netbook and view it from there </s>
