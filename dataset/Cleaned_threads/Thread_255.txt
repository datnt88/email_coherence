<s> i was restarting my desktop when a power surge went through my room </s>
<s> my atxpw550 power source was spewing dense smoke through both the front and especially the back of the pc </s>
<s> i want to know if the damage would be isolated to the power source or could it have corrupted other vital components as well </s>
<s> i know i should have used a surge protector </s>
<s> but times are tough </s>
<s> i need this info to know what credit to claim from my landlord </s>
<s> power supplies standards long before an ibm pc even existed defined functions so that a supply causes no other damage </s>
<s> to have damage means a supply was missing what must be standard in all machines </s>
<s> a problem mostly found when computer assemblers select a supply only on dollars watts or name </s>
<s> an assembler not the supply manufacturer is responsible for having required functions inside a computer </s>
<s> a supply manufacturer will say in specifications whether those required functions exist </s>
<s> if an assembler does not read those specs then nobody can say if a computer contains standard and required protection </s>
<s> if you had a surge then also list other surge damaged appliances </s>
<s> chances are the defect is due to the most common reason for failure </s>
<s> a manufacturing defect </s>
<s> to say more would be apparent by identifying physically damaged part s </s>
<s> i ve been in the shop when an owner was allowed to show us what was wrong with their pc </s>
<s> no surge occurred we had many other pcs on the mains at the time and their machine s psu failed taking every board and drive with it there was a moment of silence and then people left the area so to not hurt their feelings </s>
<s> so you ll never know what s dead until you test it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> imho electrical problems are just another headache that can effect everything that s connected </s>
<s> there is no guarantee than it will be isolated </s>
<s> if in fact you had other protection schemes in place to help you then you reduce any possible damage </s>
<s> if nothing other than a ac cord you need to find out the hard way what is effected </s>
<s> in no uncertain once the new psu in put into place it will tell in the real world what can be effected </s>
<s> until then you re at the mercy of can be had </s>
<s> i can only suggest in future setups that you include some surge protection like a power strip or ac cord ends had the basic protection </s>
<s> this maybe too late but a lesson learned </s>
<s> if you have the ability test components and devices elsewhere to help eliminate the accumulative effect that at times are also a problem </s>
<s> in other words alone they may not cause a problem but together will </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> if you are going to be compensated then you will need to have receipts anyway </s>
<s> replace the power supply and see if anything else is destroyed </s>
<s> you can do this yourself or take it to a shop </s>
<s> fortunately i have seen many instances of power supplies dying without any other damage but it is impossible to know for sure until you have checked it out </s>
<s> maybe be other things were damaged maybe not </s>
<s> wouldn t think it s your landlords fault </s>
