<s> a friend running windows xp has an hp color laserjet 1600 and she asked me to have a look at why it wasn t printing </s>
<s> i clicked on the printer icon in the control panel which brought up the printer </s>
<s> when i right clicked on the printer it displayed the words paused deleting </s>
<s> i un paused the printer the documents in her queue printed and the printer disappeared </s>
<s> i re installed the printer but could never get anything to print </s>
<s> the first item in the print queue would have a printing status of error printing </s>
<s> running the windows troubleshooter yielded nothing </s>
<s> i could not print a test page print from dos etc i then did a system restore to get her system back to a week ago </s>
<s> the printer once again said paused deleting only the documents were the new documents i d tried to print after the re install </s>
<s> i un paused and the new documents printed </s>
<s> and the printer again disappeared </s>
<s> i can t seem to fix this </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> the heading on the peripherals forum declares that cnet s forum on peripherals is the best source for finding help troubleshooting and getting buying advice from a community of experts </s>
<s> discussion topics include laser printers inkjet printers external hard drives webcams monitors keyboards and mouse questions </s>
<s> i posted this question over a month ago and have had zero responses </s>
<s> is there something wrong with the way i phrased the question </s>
<s> our computer help has more readers </s>
<s> my thought is the old stop and start the print spooler issue or fix </s>
<s> i make no apologies for microsoft leaving this unfixed and decline to dive into a dissertation about it </s>
<s> so the short answer is that its still buggy </s>
<s> you can improve it sometimes with the latest service pack and hp s drivers but even then i ll have to open the command line up and stop the spooler delete a few files and restart it </s>
<s> in closing you may not know this so let me add the video driver is used to render some content </s>
<s> this means we want the video driver to be current too </s>
<s> good luck bob </s>
