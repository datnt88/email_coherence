<s> list date and version for a motherboard chipset driver package </s>
<s> b sound card driver </s>

<s> power supply is 300w as for cleaning i have a 500w blower machine with which i clean quite often fans heat sinks n all </s>
<s> for the os install routine completely formatted my c drive then installed from cd and then sp3 as for motheboard from siw manufacturer </s>
<s> i don t write about it since you can use google for the pictures and more </s>
<s> be sure to do the work </s>
<s> as to the power supply it s on the light side </s>
<s> can you unplug that second hard disk second dvd drive to lighten the load for testing </s>
<s> as to the chipset driver i don t see the version intel just put out in use </s>
<s> here s the link gt use item 2 dated 6 2 2008 </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> nah the link didnt work </s>
<s> say can increasing my ram be any helpful </s>
<s> or is it because of the power supply </s>
<s> 250 watt power supply directx 9 does not specify ram requirements here </s>
<s> you may wish to search them out in the evga quot support quot page as well as other hardware requirement to run this card </s>
<s> how about the most resent driver </s>
<s> the specifications evga support drivers this thread untracked </s>
<s> the requirement from manual for the fx5500 are ibm or 100 pc compatible with genuine pentium ii or amd k6 2 class processor or higher </s>
<s> one available agp 2 0 compliant slot or better or one available pci slot as required for your specific card </s>

<s> i think my pc exceeds all these but still i have the problem </s>
<s> nd yes i have the latest drivers installed </s>
<s> my friend tells me to reinstall os but its a real pain and not guaranteed to work btw there is no problem with other tasks in the pc just games </s>
<s> you have a dated system </s>
<s> increasing ram and swapping out the psu seems to be your best bet </s>
<s> under xp os having 512mb is practical 1gb being the most sensible </s>
<s> gaming just puts it all in a basket and tests the wankle out of it so upgrade </s>
<s> since you system is older don t expect the newer demanding games to run as well too after the upgrades they want so much more as you review those requirements so beware </s>
<s> if possible you may want to look for a better cpu as well for the total upgrade path options </s>
<s> yours may support upto 2 4ghz p4 and that too needs better psu </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
