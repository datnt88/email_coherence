<s> my friend has this hp pavilion 7935 desktop pc which came with winxp 1 3 ghz amd 128 mb ram </s>
<s> he had some problems with it and now after a format he has win2k pro on one of two partitions </s>
<s> the display adapter has been installed after heavy searching </s>
<s> the network adapter was automatically installed by win2k </s>
<s> now i need to install the modem and audio drivers but don t know the manufacturer model </s>
<s> the hp site was not helpful </s>
<s> does anyone know this machine hp pavilion 7935 and what modem and sound card it has </s>
<s> or do you know a utility that will tell me the manufacturer model make etc </s>
<s> of the hardware before it has been installed and working </s>
<s> belarc only tells me stuff about hardware that is already installed with the correct drivers </s>
<s> i need to install the drivers for the modem and the sound card but don t know the manufacturer make model etc </s>
<s> in order to do a search </s>
<s> look in the hp support forums </s>
<s> you find discussions like this one bob </s>
<s> strange you can t find the driver for the modem just going to the hp driver site putting in pavilion 7935 immediately brings me to the xp drivers and shows a modem driver specifically </s>
<s> they also have a driver recover capability that you run using these instructions </s>
