<s> ok this has been a lingering problem </s>
<s> i have wireless on my computer </s>
<s> the problem is that everytime i open ie i get that its not connecting to internet message </s>
<s> it gives me an option of running the windows diagnostic which i do </s>
<s> it usually works then i can get online </s>
<s> sometimes i have to run it a few times before i can get online </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> if so the wireless connection could be lost and it s taking a bit to get reconnected </s>
<s> if you have the network connection icon in your system tray lower right corner you can quickly check its status by putting the pointer over it </s>
<s> no it doesnt go asleep </s>
<s> this happens right when i power up </s>
<s> i do show a strong signal on my network and my other laptop does work fine </s>
<s> ie just always makes me go through the dignostic in orer to use the internet </s>
<s> is there a setting taht i am missing </s>
<s> i had the same situations before what you can try is updating the router driver </s>
<s> also u can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the router driver </s>
<s> i dont recall ever installing the driver for the router its plug and play </s>
