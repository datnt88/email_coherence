<s> i m putting together an old pc i brought home from school with all the same parts except for the case </s>
<s> when i hook everything in turn on the psu and turn on the power the fans run for less that one second before turning off </s>
<s> i am positive the motherboard is not shorting out on the case nor is any other component </s>
<s> i ve triple checked all of the connections but i still get the same problem </s>
<s> it s possible that on the trip back one or more of the parts may have sustained damage </s>
<s> can anyone diagnose this problem </s>
<s> specs asus p5b motherboard intel core 2 duo e6300 2x corsair 512mb ram rosewill 480w psu seagate 150gb hdd geforce 7600gt vga lite on dvd rom drive </s>
<s> since this was free and you may not know the previous history you re probably experiencing the original problem of the pc </s>
<s> while you mentioned you re sure no shorts on mounting you should return the system to a minimum level plus have it on a non conductive surface aka cardboard </s>
<s> no drives only video some ram and mtrbd </s>
<s> with kybd </s>
<s> and mouse </s>
<s> power on and see what it does </s>
<s> take steps to proceed if it boots or signals its ok i further suggest you inspect the mtrbd </s>
<s> for any leaking bulged distended blown capacitors looks like small soda cans </s>
<s> try all that tada willy </s>
<s> i did what you said but the same thing happened </s>
<s> i couldn t find anything visibly wrong with the motherboard or any other component </s>
<s> if there is a 110 220 switch on the psu make sure it has not been changed </s>
<s> this board may need the four wire plug to be used </s>
<s> if all else fails one can short between the green and any black wire on the wide plug to see if the psu fires up and stays on </s>
<s> and lastly do the drastic </s>
<s> sometimes it is necessary to bench check a computer that will fail to start </s>
<s> this involves pulling the power supply and pulling the motherboard </s>
<s> remove everything from the motherboard and place the bare board and power supply on a piece of styrofoam or cardboard </s>
<s> with the power supply on the table connected to the motherboard and power supply plugged in use a small tool to momentarily short the two power on pins </s>
<s> the power supply should turn on and stay on noted by the supply s fan running </s>
<s> power off </s>
<s> now put the cpu hsf on add one stick of ram and mount the motherboard and power supply back into the case </s>
<s> connect the power switch wiring no mouse keyboard or monitor or case fans and again see if the power supply turns on and stays on </s>
<s> get past this point power off and connect the keyboard mouse and monitor if needed get into the bios to set boot options </s>
<s> add one thing at a time checking each item </s>
<s> case fans first </s>
<s> first drive to add should be your cd </s>
<s> drive then hard drive </s>
<s> i shorted the green and black wires on the psu and it worked but there s something i don t understand should the psu be on as long as the two wires are touching or should it continue to work after they have been separated </s>
<s> when i tried it it would only function when the two wires were touching </s>
<s> i have already taken everything off of the motherboard and hooked it up to the psu and it still would only work for a second </s>
<s> ok pull everything off the mtrbd all ram cpu cards and what have you </s>
<s> it should be like the day it was build blank </s>
<s> attach psu and speaker and power on it should beep like crazy or some beeping </s>
<s> if you like leave a fan that gets power from mtrbd </s>
<s> connection </s>
<s> if that fan stays on plus the psu fan you have a possible mtrbd </s>
<s> issue </s>
<s> if not or it simply twitches its a psu problem replace with known good new one retry </s>
<s> if you continue to get no fans running or no beeps the mtrbd </s>
<s> has had it for whatever reason </s>
<s> some people may try to short the bios pins in order to clear the bios and return to defaults </s>
<s> atx mtrbds </s>
<s> have a start ckt </s>
<s> and or vrm area maybe module which may have failed and unless you re capable and able to find parts its a wash replace the mtrbd </s>
<s> with a new old one and march on </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> when the two pins are connected </s>
<s> did you get a chance to try the rest of the procedure i e hook up only thing at a time to determine where it ceases to stay on </s>
<s> in my previous tests i always left the processor in because i thought it would have no weight on the matter </s>
<s> when i performed your test i removed everything including the processor and only connected the psu and the case speaker to the motherboard </s>
<s> when i did this the psu fan ran consistently until i cut the power and when i replaced the processor it went back to only turning on for a second </s>
<s> does this mean that the processor is the problem </s>
