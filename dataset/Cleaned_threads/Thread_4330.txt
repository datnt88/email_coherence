<s> i think i have all ready messed up this new thread countless times </s>
<s> my wife says to keep trying </s>
<s> i have to start by saying that i am a combat veteran with some comprehensive and memory problems </s>
<s> i understand a little about computers but probably not too much if any </s>
<s> i use my computer primarily for fps gaming </s>
<s> i guess that i like to shoot things or people without anyone really getting hurt </s>
<s> i did have a dell dimension c521 with a 80 gb hard drive and a what i consider to be dell s standard tsst dvd drive </s>
<s> obviously it lacked tremoundsly </s>
<s> i was lucky and married a wonderful woman and recently talked her into buying us a dell xps 625 no criticism for buying two dells in a row please </s>
<s> from what i read on the net and the sizing of the case power supply potential as well as for expansion capability and also a payment plan made me a buyer </s>
<s> i want to take the 80gb hard drive out of the old computer and put it into my new one </s>
<s> there are expansion slots for extra hard drives in the xps complete with cabling and after suffering with such a previous small capacity hard drive i feel that every gb matters </s>
<s> i need to know how to do this </s>
<s> stats for my current computer are as follows xps_xps 625 amd phenom 9850 quad core processor 2 46 ghz ram 4 00 gb system type 64 bit os vista home premium ati radeon hd 4670 hard drive 500 gb 2 dvd drives i took the dvd drive out of my old computer and stuck it into the new one two have to dvd drives in it </s>
<s> with the hard drive how do i reformat it to completely blank it out </s>
<s> i don t want anything from the old drive </s>
<s> just extra storage compacity maybe all music maybe just for anything </s>
<s> do i need to install my current os to my old drive to make it work </s>
<s> i m using vista home premium now but the old os was home basic </s>
<s> do i need any os at all if all i want is data storage </s>
<s> i don t know </s>
<s> i have a million questions but if one knowledgable person gets the drift of what i am asking for then please give advice </s>
<s> imho you really don t need two dvd drives installed </s>
<s> unless you plan to do alot of copying and even then it maybe too slow </s>
<s> its actually better to use a hd and dvd in such cases </s>
<s> also the power burden of a dvd drive that does nothing until needed is just that a burden </s>
<s> save it as a spare </s>
<s> as for the hd itself mount the old hd and use either master slave setup or cs </s>
<s> if sata type then mount in next available port </s>
<s> after bootup goto quot disk management quot and format the old hd </s>
<s> be 100 sure you are addressing the old hd and proceed </s>
<s> here s the ms link on the topic once done the prepared hd is now ready for data </s>
<s> all previous data is gone and effectively you have a blank hd recognized by the system as letter quot quot </s>
<s> gain while 80gb may seem alot it too places power burden </s>
<s> i mention this as most oem type systems tend to be power deficient until proven so </s>
<s> a new 500gb hd on sale are available at 99 or less if you want alot extra storage </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> xp install is pretty much the same as vista procedure </s>
<s> it maybe described differently though the same steps </s>
<s> here s vista procedure you can always google for various system tasks or procedures as they frequently available for vista based queries besides these forums </s>
