<s> hi i just bought a t6212 and wanted to upgrade the graphics card </s>
<s> i was thinking aboutthe ati x800xl </s>
<s> but anyways will i have a problem using this card </s>
<s> the card i believe calls for a 420 watt power supply </s>
<s> does anyone know the power supply on the t6212 and if this would pose a problem </s>
<s> that card plugs into a normal pci express slot on the motherboard </s>
<s> i don t think the power supply has anything to do with it </s>
<s> forget about what it quot calls for quot computers don t use nearly as much power as they claim </s>
<s> a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system </s>
<s> besides one graphics card hardly makes a dent </s>
<s> get the card and plug it in if runs fine then no problem </s>
<s> however if playin a intensive game and computer restarts or sudden restarts happen for no apparent reason consider getting a new power supply </s>
<s> the emachine t6212 comes with a 300w power supply </s>
<s> the ati x800xl is a fine card </s>
<s> seaninwa in this theard installed a x899xl and didn t mention upgrading the ps someone else in that thread rickgut2004 installed a 450w power supply with his t6212 </s>
<s> if you have problems then of course increase the ps </s>
<s> graphics card is bascially just one little chip </s>
<s> with no moving parts unlike a harddisk how much power would it really consume </s>
<s> i ve heard of people using larger powersources but only for these really weird servers with dozens of harddisk arrays connected to one machine </s>
<s> 300w comes standard </s>
<s> how much more do you need </s>
<s> it depends on the power supply </s>
<s> some are weak low cost ones even at 450w and can t supply a continuous amount to handle the additional stuff </s>
<s> when a factory puts out a computer they try to match the power supply for what they have installed at the time of delivery </s>
<s> so if you start adding stuff like high end video cards and other things then that particular ps may not pass the muster </s>
<s> some reading material </s>
<s> oh yeah </s>
<s> and so what drives the fan on this </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a fan is a fan how much power would that consume </s>
<s> _ </s>
<s> just a little more than this gt graphics card is bascially just one little chip </s>
<s> with no moving parts </s>
