<s> alright my brother just gave me an old asus desktop </s>
<s> whenever i try to power it on it starts beeping and doesn t start </s>
<s> how can i find out what the problem is </s>
<s> on beep codes </s>
<s> like wayne suggests search for the beep codes for that particular model </s>
<s> the beeps are telling you the nature of the problem </s>
<s> once you understand the codes you ll be on your way to repairing the machine </s>
