<s> i was wondering if the following was good for a basically mild gaming then some multitasking </s>
<s> and if everything was compatable etc </s>
<s> thanks in advance the parts are listed below case motherboard cpu power supply cpu cooler hard drive graphics card </s>
<s> you re forgetting the memory </s>
<s> btw that s not what i would consider a budget pc with a 8800gts </s>
<s> you might want to get the socket am2 instead of socket 939 </s>
<s> i really wouldnt call getting a 8800gt a quot mild quot gaming pc because that gpu is for people that like gaming and are preparing for directx10 hope this helps </s>
<s> if you are doing mild gaming you don t need that nice a graphics card </s>
<s> infact you would be fine with agp or maybe even integrated graphics </s>
<s> a pny vetro 6600 not gt 256 agp card will do fine </s>
<s> i have one in an older computer and it can run halo counterstrike ect and unless your playing batlefield 2 or something you ll be fine </s>
<s> this will also save you some on the motherboard but good call on the asus </s>
<s> stay with that brand </s>
<s> key part missing </s>
<s> ram </s>
<s> get 1 gig of fairly fast ram and you should be fine </s>
<s> and finaly you don t need a 3800 proccessor </s>
<s> a 3200 will suit your needs perfectly </s>
<s> trust me </s>
<s> i have tested many products and you ll be fine with these </s>
