<s> i would like to upgrade my celeron processor to a pentium 3 or 4 and would like to know more about doing so </s>
<s> will i need to change motherboards </s>
<s> any other info would be appreciated </s>
<s> since socket 370 boards took a variety for celeron and pentium 3 s and socket 478 boards took a variety of celeron and pentium 4 s the missing piece of information is the make model of the motherboard </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> intel 810 chipset </s>
<s> 370 socket </s>
<s> hp told me it wasn t upgradeable i assume that means i ll have to change motherboards </s>
<s> while you noted it s 810 based a 370 socket and a hp you left out which hp </s>
<s> it would have been nice to know the model number of the machine to see if someone had a success story but without more information not only will you likely change the motherboard but the power supply and case as well </s>

<s> sorry i didn t know you meant the pc model it s an hp 7915 also can i blame the slow boot time mostly on the processor </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> 1 slow boots are defined as it s booting in minutes more than ever before </s>
<s> you didn t tell the forum how many seconds its taking so in my estimation that s not the issue </s>
<s> 2 for example is a 100 mhz fsb cpu to fit such a machine </s>
<s> but if this was my machine i d know that any 100 mhz fsb cpu might work </s>
<s> i d have to consider my risk quotient to see if i d pop for this set the problem here is that p3 s move the fsb up to 133 and we can t tell if you can do that </s>
<s> sit the selection of possible items is the 219 dollar unit or this slightly faster celeron </s>
<s> my choice </s>
<s> i wouldn t do this </s>
<s> 3 to speed up most machines i find the following helps </s>
<s> a no pests allowed </s>
<s> i run all five tools noted at b cwshredder noted at c starter would be used to clean up the startup items </s>
<s> d bring out your dead </s>
<s> or rather be brutal and uninstall any program you haven t used in 2 or 3 months </s>
<s> full hard disks run slow </s>
<s> e review optimizing windows at either for win9x me or for 2000 xp f toss bloated items like norton 2004 or system works out in favor of free avg from g get 512 megabytes </s>
