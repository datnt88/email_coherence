<s> i have just completed my installation of an intel pentium d 940 processor on a biostar p4m900m7 se motherboard </s>
<s> the box of the cpu shows the cpu as intel pd 940 3 2ghz oem </s>
<s> however my winxp system info settings control panel system shows intel r pentium r d cpu 3 2ghz 1 60ghz 1 93 gb of ram physical address extension is this correct </s>
<s> is my cpu running at 1 6ghz or 3 2ghz </s>
<s> if i am only running my cpu at half speed what can i do to change it </s>
<s> well i got a dual core cpu so it works at 3 2ghz yeh but it says that its 1 6 ghz so if u got a dual core cpu dont worry about it if you dont i dont know whats wrong </s>
<s> thanks i found the fix </s>
<s> there is an option in the bios called quot load the optimised defaults quot </s>
<s> after i click it control panel systems now show 3 2 ghz </s>
<s> i guess it was set at a lower rate when it first installed and started up </s>
<s> this may be the quot normal default quot of the bios </s>
