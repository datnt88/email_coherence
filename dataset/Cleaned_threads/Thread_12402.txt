<s> can the maxtor shared storage plus drive be formatted or split partitioned in a way to allow backups from both a windows xp computer and a mac running leopard </s>
<s> i m using it currently and am very happy with the drive just wondering what my backup options are going to be when i get my imac in a couple of weeks </s>
<s> also i have a canon ip5200 printer connected to the drive with with a usb cable which i have set up as a network printer </s>
<s> anything special i should know about setting it up on the imac </s>
<s> posting to the maxtor support forums hasn t brought any replies yet </s>
<s> it s a nas and we don t partition nas products </s>
<s> this is likely why no responses </s>
<s> just create a directory folder </s>
<s> for each system and save your copy there </s>
<s> finally this is not backup </s>
<s> it fails basic rules about backup as in multiple copies multiple media off site storage write protection and more </s>
<s> it does make for a nice online copy </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that the file system mattered especially if using time machine </s>
<s> is that correct </s>
<s> if so do i need to format the drive as xfs efs or something like that </s>
<s> notice how many systems work </s>
<s> i ll post back after i have the imac and let you know how it worked out </s>
