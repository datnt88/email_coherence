<s> hi there </s>
<s> i currently have an ati radeon x1600 pro 256 i sometimes experience some lag when i m playing games and i was wondering if upgrading to the radeon x1650 pro 512 would show a considerable difference </s>
<s> i m currently running 1gb of ram would upgrading to 2gb also solve the slowdowns </s>
<s> it will slowdown </s>
<s> there is no known system that doesn t slowdown on complex scenes </s>
<s> if you are running vista the 2gb is well known as a must have on games </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> x1650pro is just a bit faster than x1600pro but not worthwhile as an upgrade </s>
<s> in my opinion you d need to upgrade to a x1950pro or 7900gs for a noticeable improvement and only a x1950xt or 7950gt or better would be worth the cash </s>
<s> if you re slowing down in certain games more ram may help depending on the game </s>
<s> for example battlefield 2 needs 1 5gb or more for smooth play </s>
