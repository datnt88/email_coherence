<s> i have been a user of superduper </s>
<s> for some time and understand the process of making a bootable clone of my startup drive </s>
<s> the other day my bootable backup drive crashed </s>
<s> it was an iomega that had been partitioned and worked fine as a bootable backup until the drive itself failed </s>
<s> the iomega was a firewire 400 drive </s>
<s> when i bought a replacement i bought a western digital fw 800 400 usb 2 esata connection system </s>
<s> 1 tb </s>
<s> i partitioned it and created a bootable clone with the latest version of superduper </s>
<s> the operation went smoothly until i tried to actually boot from the newly created clone </s>
<s> i could select the clone from the startup disk panel but my mac refuses to boot from it </s>
<s> it looks then says quot hmmm </s>
<s> i think i ll start up from the internal drive quot i have another wd fw 400 usb 2 0 drive and it is bootable as well as a lacie fw 400 that i can make bootable </s>
<s> only this one drive that has no specific fw 400 port will not boot </s>
<s> i tried it as fw 800 no dice </s>
<s> i connected with the adapter cable to the fw 400 port no joy </s>
<s> i can return this wd drive for exchange </s>
<s> my question is should i expect the same results if i exchange it for another drive of the same type </s>
<s> or is there a chance that a new drive of the same type will work </s>
<s> powermac dual g5 2 ghz os x 10 4 11 it has a fw 800 port as well as fw 400 thanks for any advice you can offer </s>
<s> ed </s>
<s> in sd you have the option to make the clone bootable </s>
<s> if yours were unchecked chances are that sd did not make it bootable </s>
<s> i would first repeat the cloning making sure that this option is enabled </s>
<s> if it fails then return the drive </s>
<s> i would suggest you get an owc one </s>
<s> they have a very good reputation and are portable to boot no pun intended </s>
<s> in fact i did have quot make bootable quot checked both times a tried </s>
<s> under startup disk the folder on that drive showed up as bootable but when it came to push and shove it would not start up from there </s>
<s> i guess i ll switch to another brand </s>
<s> i liked the idea of an fw800 drive but being able to boot is the key element i need </s>
<s> thanks for your suggestions </s>
<s> regards ed </s>
<s> if that option was checked then sd would have booted from the external after having finished cloning </s>
<s> this would mean that the drive is in fact bootable and some glitch in the startup disk pane on the main computer just precludes its selection as a boot drive </s>
<s> i would repeat the cloning or if you remember what happened don t do it and see that the external is booted into indeed </s>
<s> if this is the case i would create another account with admin preferences and see if you can select the boot drive from its preference pane i am not sure there is a pref file for this pane to trash </s>
<s> if it works ok then you have a problem with the main account and you might like first to apply another combo update not from software update or run techtool pro or diskwarrior </s>
<s> if nothing works i would then exchange or return the external drive </s>
<s> sd is setting the drive to be the boot drive </s>
<s> it says so </s>
<s> the startup disk pref panel let s me choose the clone and sd had it selected </s>
<s> when i boot no joy </s>
<s> in fact if i hold down the option key after during startup i should be allowed to choose the startup drive </s>
<s> that does not work properly the newly created drive does not show up </s>
<s> if i take a different clone created previously and attach that to the mac i can boot from it just fine </s>
<s> i have even returned the drive for a new one same brand model and it also will not start up my mac </s>
<s> this is not user error </s>
<s> it is a drive that will not boot an older mac no matter what sd says or does </s>
<s> the startup drive is not an account issue since it fails to start long before the account information is relevant </s>
<s> i m going to take this one back and get a fw400 drive like the one that will boot my mac </s>
<s> since this is an interesting case that may affect others let me ask you a question are the other drives that boot also partitioned so that only one partition has an os x </s>
<s> if it was installed on the whole drive that could be the issue </s>
<s> if you do not partition the 1 tb but just clone the internal to it maybe it would work as intended </s>
<s> but you are right about the issue related to the drive itself </s>
<s> i have a 1tb lacie drive that i partitioned into 4 equal partitions </s>
<s> i proceeded to use that drive to create clone startup volumes that work fine on four different powerpc computers running 10 4 11 the drive i had that crashed prompting the purchase of the present drive was an iomega that had two partitions one for the bootable clone and the other for data </s>
<s> in every case i have always partitioned the drives into at least 2 partitions one slightly larger than my internal drive and the other taking up the rest of the available space </s>
<s> i am not interested in cloning my internal 150 gb drive to a 1 tb drive that has not been partitioned </s>
<s> summary of what i have 500 gb iomega drive partitioned to two volumes one volume clones my internal drive </s>
<s> this drive crashed last week after working for about 3 years </s>
<s> 1 tb lacie partitioned into 4 equal volumes </s>
<s> each volume successfully will startup the computer from which it was cloned </s>
<s> 500 gb western digital partitioned to two volumes </s>
<s> one volume clones one of my other macs a 2004 imac and works fine </s>
<s> 1 tb western digital fw800 400 usb2 esata partitioned to two volumes 200 gb and the rest of available space </s>
<s> this is the problem drive </s>
<s> superduper </s>
<s> will make a clone of my internal drive but the clone will not boot the computer </s>
<s> i intend to replace this drive with a lacie like the one above </s>
<s> i should also mention that in partitioning the drive i choose the option for using the apple file system intended to boot powerpc macs </s>
<s> when partitioning and cloning i start up in quot safe boot quot mode and have verified with both disk utility and techtool pro 5 that all drives are free of volume errors and have run repair of permissions on my startup volume before cloning </s>
<s> for a detailed reply </s>
<s> i agree that partitioning by itself does not seem to be a factor </s>
<s> your assumption about the defective wrong drive might be the right one </s>
<s> i and many others had good luck with owc drives </s>
<s> i returned the wd drive and traded it for a lacie like my other one </s>
<s> i partitioned it and superduper </s>
<s> made a bootable clone of my internal hd </s>
<s> no problems starting up from the clone </s>
<s> my conclusion is that either the wd fw800 drive will not start an older mac or possibly superduper </s>
<s> may need to be updated </s>
<s> i will drop them a note so they will be aware of the situation </s>
<s> i guess another possibility is that wd s drive might require an os later than mine 10 4 11 to be bootable </s>
<s> i asked shirt pocket software about this </s>
<s> here is the reply quot wd external drives do not support startup on power pc macs ed </s>
<s> that s one reason we never recommend them quot that is interesting and i wish i had known earlier </s>
<s> recall however that i actually have a wd drive that starts up my wife s imac power pc 2004 vintage </s>
<s> first sd has been updated several times in the last two months maybe your version is old </s>
<s> second i just saw something about the partitions on external drives to the effect that they may need a firmware update see anyway i am glad you resolved the issue </s>
<s> in fact i was using an older version of sd </s>
<s> boy </s>
<s> did i feel stupid </s>
<s> i discovered my error as i was composing my email to shirt pocket so i told them what i was using and asked if that might be the explanation for my problems </s>
<s> the response to that part of my email was quot no quot </s>
<s> i m going to have to take their word for it </s>
<s> it s looking like wd is abandoning making drives that will boot power pc macs </s>
<s> so it might be a firmware issue after all </s>
<s> i don t know much about firmware and how it might be involved in this but i do like the fact that my new drive shows no problems starting up my mac </s>
<s> thanks much for your ideas on this </s>
<s> i hope the discussion has benefited someone else </s>
<s> regards ed </s>
