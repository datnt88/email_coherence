<s> i am building a computer for the first time and i have a few questions </s>
<s> will an antec 350w case with ps be enough to power an amd 64 3000 dvdrw drive geforce fx 5200 </s>
<s> which would be easier to set up ide or sata hd </s>
<s> if i had just the dvdrw on its own channel would i set it to slave or master and if i decided to go with an ide hd would i put the two on the same channel or on different ones and if they were on the same which would be slave and master </s>
<s> quot will a 350w ps be enough to power an amd 64 3000 dvdrw drive geforce fx 5200 quot yes quot which would be easier to set up ide or sata quot ide quot if i had just the dvdrw on its own channel would i set it to slave or master quot master quot if i decided to go with an ide hd would i put the two on the same channel or on different ones quot different ones with the hd as primary master and the dvdrw drive as secondary master quot if they were on the same which would be slave and master quot hd master and dvdrw slave </s>
<s> thanks man isnt the whole cablin setup of a sata drive easier though </s>
<s> like do u set a master and slave on sata </s>
<s> is the recognization of sata drives a little quirkier than it is with ide drives </s>
<s> while that will be a big enough power supply to start the install you may install hardware that will require a lot more than that in the near future </s>
<s> get a 400 450w power supply don t settle for only 350w </s>
<s> see im lookin at an antec solution series case with a 350w ps or a case from liteon with a 400w ps </s>
<s> is going with the better company with lower wattage a good idea </s>
<s> in my experience cases that come with power supplies often times like to rip you off and give you crap </s>
<s> antec i would trust and lite on yeah maybe i d trust them too </s>
<s> but an alternate solution would be to buy a case without a psu take the money you save on that and buy a psu of your choice </s>
<s> that s how i always do it </s>
<s> and the 350 watts is kinda low for your hardware </s>
<s> definetly go higher it never hurts </s>
<s> hehe if you can get an xp 3000 i dont think an extra 50 60 will hurt </s>
<s> then again maybe im wrong </s>
