<s> pioneer dvr 107d v1 22 firmware and quot kernel quot downloads </s>
<s> by sugarbear246 8 25 10 10 51 pm i have a pioneer dvd rw dvr 107d dvd cd rom drive burner </s>
<s> i am trying to update the firmware to the latest version v1 22 i successfully downloaded the firmware and know the command to run at the quot command prompt quot and i have the firmware downloaded and installed in the proper directory to receive my command </s>
<s> got one problem though the command prompt tell me i need the quot kernel quot that goes along with the firmware update but i ll be darned if i can find quot where to download dvr 107d v 122 quot kernel quot </s>
<s> anybody out there got any ideas </s>
<s> boy what a bummer </s>
<s> thanks sugarbear246 </s>
<s> but what s the goal here </s>
<s> reading posts like i wonder if you are trying the hack the drive or just trying to save an old dead drive </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> unfortunately i have also visited this same link and the error message i received is quot target not found quot when i tried to install the update </s>
<s> i find this to be interesting since this is a direct link to a pioneer web page </s>
<s> i did however find a link to a dvr 107d firmware update from a european union web page that installed without a problem </s>
<s> here is the link i found it beats me why pioneer firmware updates in europe would be different than those for the us </s>
<s> now for the real reason i have been trying to update the firmware on this drive </s>
<s> it is also a quot burner quot and i have been trying to revive it with the firmware update </s>
<s> the truth is the drive quot still does not burn properly quot </s>
<s> looks as though no firmware update of any kind will revive this drive quot for burning quot that is it works fine for just playing a dvd </s>
<s> anyway thats the skinny of it i found my answer but i found it in a manner i did not expect </s>
<s> hope this helps someone else </s>
<s> sugarbear246 </s>
<s> i ve watched folk try to revive dead burners with firmware </s>
<s> the results seem to fade with each year the drive ages </s>
<s> good luck in finding the firmware but i ve found that with each passing year there is less and less support and the files fade away </s>
<s> try a cd dvd lens cleaner </s>
