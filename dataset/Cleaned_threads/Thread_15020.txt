<s> i want to burn dvds so that they play on dvd players these will contain still and video pictures </s>
<s> we have a dell vostro with vista and a dell inspiron 6000 with xp </s>
<s> the vostro has a dvd burner but dvds done on it may or may not work on players </s>
<s> any suggestions for an external burner and software that will produce dvds that will reliably play on dvd players as well as on other computers </s>
<s> thanks ed s </s>
<s> first there is no standard dvd that holds such </s>
<s> then you have players that don t play recorded media to those that play dvd r but not dvd r and vice versa </s>
<s> there is no panacea </s>
<s> however i continue to use dvd flick for simple video dvds and for photos i may try or just put the jpegs on a data dvd and find that many of the newer players work fine </s>
<s> sorry but this is a minefield of problems issues compatibilities and more </s>
<s> i ve found i need to choose my battles here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t think there is a 100 reliable dvd burner and software out there </s>
<s> you have to try one 1 yourself </s>
<s> have you burned playable videos for tv before </s>
<s> i use multiple dvd roms asus nec liteon teac and nero software it works 90 of the time </s>
<s> you need to try 1 man no need to fear this </s>
