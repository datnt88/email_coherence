<s> i have a laptop in fine working order hard drive from my desktop that for some reason won t boot up to xp and has data on there that i want to recover </s>
<s> not sure what the problem is but one of three things happen when i power up the comp 1 the drive is not detected or there is some sort of error before xp begins to load 2 xp will act like it s loading and take an extremely long time or 3 i ll get to the xp desktop but my wallpaper is gone and xp is frozen and i am going to purchase a usb hard drive something i should have done a while ago is it possible to get the data from my old drive to the usb drive using only the above items and the necessary cables etc </s>
<s> i don t have another computer with sata support so absent some solution that i can conjure up here at home i m going to have to take it in somewhere </s>
<s> you hopefully were not trying to boot that xp from the other machine </s>
<s> if so that does not work </s>
<s> what can work is to put the old drive as slave or in the external drive and copy your files out </s>
<s> xp does not boot or run when we move it bob </s>
<s> i don t want to boot xp from the desktop hard drive although if i could i would so that i could then back up my files to the usb drive </s>
<s> but what i have right now is a brick with data on it and i was hoping i could power up that drive connect it to the usb drive maybe while it s connected to my laptop and then transfer from my old drive to the usb drive </s>
<s> let s say we have a brick </s>
<s> we need to get the hard disk out of said brick to be put into some usb case or slave on another machine </s>
<s> then we can copy the files out </s>
<s> hope this is clearer </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i just hadn t used an external usb drive before and i was hoping against common sense that what i described above could be done </s>
<s> fortunately i just realized that i know someone who probably has sata support so i ll have to give him a ring </s>
<s> this includes a ready boost usb </s>
<s> if not follow bob s lead </s>
<s> thread untracked </s>
<s> how did quot thick as a brick quot </s>
<s> i ll be back in a minute seems it was quot jethro tull quot </s>
<s> so there is a way that i can turn my 250gb desktop sata drive into a usb back up drive with some sort of enclosure </s>
<s> that way i could theoretically transfer my important data from that drive to my laptop reformat the sata drive and use it just like an off the shelf usb back up drive </s>
<s> see here pick the one you like and install the old drive in the enclosure </s>
<s> connect the combination to any computer with usb 2 0 ports to get the info off of the old drive and save to the host computer or cd or dvd for later use </s>
<s> provided you have no sata hd issues then using this adapter has allowed access to data </s>
<s> this adapter is far more flexible than a simple usb enclosure but check it out if it fits yours needs </s>
<s> goto look for ada 2020 or google for a picture example </s>
<s> i ve already used in cases like yours and the other way around too getting laptop hd data </s>
<s> plus as a quick way to test cd drives as well </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
