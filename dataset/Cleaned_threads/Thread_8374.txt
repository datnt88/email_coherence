<s> i have a custom built pc and it was slowing down so i restored it but after restoring it my lb link 150mbps wireless adapter will not work after installing drivers </s>
<s> when i first plugged it in it said installing then failed so i then put the disc in and it finished installing </s>
<s> i look in device management and there is a yellow triangle beside it </s>
<s> windows being used is home premium 64bit adapter being used is </s>
<s> we know if the date time is too far off as well as motherboard drivers are not well this happens </s>
<s> there s also an issue with xp norton and more but with so little to go on tell more </s>

<s> ok so about 2 days ago i was using the computer and it was taking ages to load pages so i grabbed my windows 7 home premium 64bit and restored it before this the adapter was working i think the reason it stopped was becuase i didnt unplug it anyways when i got done restoring i installed my graphics card drivers and restarted and then tried installing the adapters drivers and it finished i plugged the adpater in and nothing </s>
<s> so i tried once or twice again to install the drivers and still nothing </s>
<s> and i went into device managers to check if it was showing up which it was but with the yellow sign beside it and 3 other universal serial bus things </s>
<s> the motherboard in the pc is a asus f2 a85 series amd a85x chipset the graphics card if that matters is a evga gtx 650ti and the processor also if that matters ia an amd quad core </s>
<s> if so then you have all the drivers to deal with and not just this wifi stick </s>
<s> some folk forget what they did but the short list i use is motherboard then audio then video then other drivers </s>
<s> if you want to try something quick unplug the stick and boot safe mode to remove the item in device manager </s>
<s> reboot normal and then install the stick per the maker s instruction </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will try this and get back to you thanks for the help </s>
<s> so i booted into safe mode and went to device manager and uninstalled all of the yellow triangle things and after restart they all tried installing and failed </s>
<s> did you have the device unplugged on the next boot </s>
<s> i ve lost count of it failing and then i delete remove it in safe mode then install the drivers on the next boot then finally plug it in </s>
<s> however your post seems to omit the motherboard driver install </s>
<s> not much has changed with windows installs over the years </s>
<s> seems a shame msft never corrected this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the general area you should go looking </s>
<s> find your exact board at this site and make sure you download and install the chipset drivers and usb drivers in that order </s>
<s> worst case you blow do a fresh install again but collect the asus drivers for your board from their web site </s>
<s> chipset drivers should be the first to be installed as other drivers may depend on getting these right </s>
