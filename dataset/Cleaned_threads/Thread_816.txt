<s> one day when i started my computer it took me to the screen that says quot ur computer did not turn off sucessfully quot </s>
<s> i tried every option there and when i start windows normally or last known good configuration it reboots when its suppose to show the window xp logo </s>
<s> i could not do a system recover as a blue screen popped up </s>
<s> sometimes my computer wouldn t even open and it would keep on beeping </s>
<s> i replaced the hard drive and hoped it would work </s>
<s> when i replace the hard drive everything worked fine until it randomly restarted again </s>
<s> i turned it on and thought it was no problem </s>
<s> a few days later the same continuos beeping noise came up </s>
<s> it would work from time to time but there would be times where it wouldn t work </s>
<s> i have a gateway and a amd processor running on window xp </s>
<s> if u need anymore information just tell me </s>
<s> could this be a virus </s>
<s> so any ideas </s>
<s> get you hands on a linux copy of a quot live boot os quot of the linux version like knoppix </s>
<s> make the bootable cd which is then a live cd </s>
<s> use that to boot and it will run from the cd alone play with it and see if the problem goes away </s>
<s> if it does you may have an os or s w problem with your original hd </s>
<s> if the problem comes back more than likely you have a h w problem </s>
<s> the sources of such maybe the mtrbd ram or psu power supply </s>
<s> the mtrbd </s>
<s> may have the quot bad caps quot which you inspect for bugling leaky or blown capacitors </s>
<s> the ram if more than one reseat them at least or swap them around or try new ones </s>
<s> if psu then only a known good one of similar wattage will do or even new more capable higher wattage replacement unit </s>
<s> all these problems maybe interrelated or not but it isn t uncommon if a true power problem to render other componets to go flaky or weird until they outright fail due to bad power </s>
<s> the above problems may result from an older system as age comes into play </s>
<s> if you haven t yet at least open case and clean out the dust bunnies </s>
<s> further leave cover off and see if that helps at all </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> it s obviously hardware fault according to your description </s>
<s> tell us what the beeps are like and we might be able to tell you exactly what s wrong </s>
<s> for instance if it makes 1 long beep and then 3 short beeps it s the graphics card </s>
<s> continious long beeps with 1 second silence could mean memory etc </s>
<s> it is a continuous beep </s>
