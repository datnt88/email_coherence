<s> hi i m posting this question from the subject that i just read about that is taking a drive from your old pc using it in the new one as a backup or to transfer files etc </s>
<s> here s my situation i completely rebuilt my pc that is to say i have the quot old quot one now as a backup up running with winxp pro installed everything just the way it was completely functional working seagate ide 80gb hdd </s>
<s> in my newly built pc i have an asus a7v880 mobo athlonxp 3000 chip 1gb ram samsung sata 80gb hdd winxp pro all updates etc </s>
<s> i had some music on the quot old quot hdd that i wanted to transfer to the new one </s>
<s> i could network everything but that s not the problem </s>
<s> the problem is that when i put the quot old quot ide drive in the new pc no matter where i put it on either ide cable primary secondary ms sl cs disk management sees it gives me properties but it doesn t show up as a drive in quot my computer quot </s>
<s> keep in mind that it works perfectly fine in the quot old quot pc the new pc sees it but i can t access it </s>
<s> i can find no information on problems with sata ide drives in the same machine so i am at a loss as to the nature of my problem </s>
<s> again this isn t insurmountable as i can network the pcs together to transfer the data but i can t figure out why the 2 drives won t play together </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> thanks in advance robert </s>
<s> i m sorry i don t have an answer for you as i am looking for one as well </s>
<s> i have to ask though do you have norton goback installed on the drive you are moving around </s>
<s> on mine the partitions appear to be somehow hidden by this program when i moved it to the new computer </s>
<s> i ve taken hd out of one computer put them in another and had no problem </s>
<s> the one time i did have a problem i had to run sysprep with the reseal option </s>
