<s> hi i have a hp photosmart c5180 printer and a few weeks ago it started having issues </s>
<s> it wouldn t print at first so we would turn it off and then back on and then it would print </s>
<s> then after a few days that quick fix didn t work and it wouldn t print at all </s>
<s> i tried the suggestions from the troubleshooting manual disconnect from pc power etc then reconnect again and that didn t work </s>
<s> i removed it from the pc and just plugged it in separately to a different outlet to see if it would work on it s own and it doesn t </s>
<s> i have to remove the power cord entirely to turn it off </s>
<s> when i leave it plugged in the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success then shuts down for a couple seconds then tries to turn on again </s>
<s> i would try a different power adapter cord but it s not a traditional cord that i can just use a spare one to connect to the printer </s>
<s> it would cost more to service this printer than it s worth so i just wanted to check here and see if anyone had similar issues or know of a fix </s>
<s> thanks for any feedback </s>
<s> you are left to your choice here </s>
<s> there is no service manual and i ve found service even a diagnostic to exceed the price of a new printer </s>
<s> some seem upset at that but would we rather pay more for a printer and service </s>
<s> if so there are better printers which can be fixed when broken </s>

<s> you didn t mention the operating system that you are using </s>
<s> did you uninstall and reinstall the software </s>
<s> if you are using vista or 7 with the c5180 you may have to upgrade the software from hp s web site </s>
<s> it may be bad harware internal printer issue as bob said but it could also be a software problem related to the printer os </s>
<s> check software before you scrap the unit c5180 was fairly decent </s>
<s> i know this post is old but my brother and i have the same printers and bought them at the same time </s>
<s> he is having the exact same problem as described above we switched printer sand mine is working on his computer </s>
<s> i searched alot of forums but no one has an answer </s>
<s> do you </s>
<s> this is what it is doing the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success then shuts down for a couple seconds then tries to turn on again </s>
<s> i cannot even estabish a computer connection as well </s>
<s> the display screen shows hp logo with the load bar trying to load and then it freezes then tries to restart again </s>
<s> i check and did all the obvious here to troubleshoot but no prevail </s>
<s> should i take it to best buy geeks </s>
<s> my answer is that there are no service manuals for these products </s>
<s> i see a few for sale at 10 to 20 dollars at while service and repair is possible the cost to do so is more than a new or used printer </s>
