<s> well about ten minutes ago i thought my rig was finished </s>
<s> the cpu and soundcard came in today and i was so excited </s>
<s> to my shock i found out that my mobo sports an older 9 pin analog video connector called a de 9 </s>
<s> my flatscreen uses de 15 pin </s>
<s> my motherboard is an am2 socket one with no integrated video </s>
<s> i have a biostar nvidia 8600 installed right now </s>
<s> it has the traditional vga 15 pin and dvi connections </s>
<s> but when i plug my video cable from my monitor into the card i get a quot no signal found quot error </s>
<s> i know the card is operating because the fans are on </s>
<s> i really want to get this hooked up so i can install my os </s>
<s> which leads me to my second problem my disc drive won t open </s>
<s> i have a traditional molex power cable connected and it s receiving power from the psu </s>
<s> the ata ribbon cable is connected to both the drive and the mobo yet it wont open the disc tray </s>
<s> i really need help here </s>
<s> i m panicking </s>
<s> have i done something wrong </s>

<s> i have a correction to make my disc drive is working now as long as the ata ribbon isn t plugged in </s>
<s> as soon as i plug it in it stops working </s>
<s> i must be the mobo or something related </s>
<s> aren t drives supposed to open as long as they have power </s>
<s> it sounds like no mb activity </s>
<s> btw your 9 pin connector is likely comm port and not a video port </s>
<s> can you remove the mb from the case and put it on a tabletop </s>
<s> connect the minimum components needed to attempt post </s>
<s> you ll need ram the cpu and video card </s>
<s> make sure all power is connected including any additional connectors that might be needed for the video card and cpu </s>
<s> common causes of problems are pulled pins from connectors and unneeded standoffs on the mb panel that short out something on the back of it </s>
<s> this is why we try it outside of the case first </s>
<s> i ve done the post multiple times and i still get no beep codes </s>
<s> everything seems to be working fine </s>
<s> should i get another mobo </s>
<s> pull it out hook it up as has been stated here in these forums many times with minimum hardware attachment and outside of the box </s>
<s> it s easy to make mistakes and if you re lucky they won t be fatal </s>
<s> beep codes indicate an attempt to post but errors were detected </s>
<s> no beeps can mean post didn t even start </s>
<s> this could be a missing voltage level </s>
<s> a simple dvm would be helpful if you have access to one </s>
<s> check and recheck your work </s>
<s> look for pins in the ps connector to the mb that pushed out of their socket </s>
<s> pull the cpu and see if any pins have been distorted </s>
<s> changing the connection on your monitor settings i bought two brand new hd3870 s running two monitors and there was no signal i then changed the signal on my monitor settings and got the picture back </s>
