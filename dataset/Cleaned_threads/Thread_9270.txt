<s> helo can any one of you suggest me some free software which can burn the commercial dvd s </s>
<s> i bought a maddog cd r rw drive </s>
<s> how do you rate this product </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you need to define what a quot commercial dvd quot is </s>
<s> i m guessing you mean the silver cds or dvds that you buy with music or video content </s>
<s> if so then you may want to know that such are not quot burned quot but are quot pressed quot </s>
<s> does that help </s>
<s> as to the mad dog </s>
<s> it s a value unit that should last a year or two but isn t very expensive </s>

<s> thanks a lot for the quick reply </s>
<s> i want to copy the movie dvd s which are in a different language and my wedding dvd s which i want to copy </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i use dvdshrink to copy dvds since it makes it so easy </s>
<s> given the nature of the program i will only note you find it with google com and will not write any more about it </s>
