<s> im trying to upgrade my dell inspiron 546 due to lack of funds to build a new rig </s>
<s> i have bought graphics cards in past but ive never bought a psu or put in a psu before but i am sure with guidance i could certainly do it </s>
<s> i want to make sure these parts will actually work with my inspiron before i buy them so thats why i am posting here today </s>
<s> psu vid card i know that the current graphics card i have in now is a 220 gt and its worth about 30 dollars and its pretty old along with my computer </s>
<s> so i dont know if this new card would even work with my mobo or anything and i also dont know if the psu would fit in my tower its not a slim so it should </s>
<s> i didn t find your model so you should link to your exact model </s>
<s> on the page shows a few 650 video cards so a good choice </s>
<s> that psu looks to be the minimum asked for i read 450 watt minimum on the pages so far and the full review at has me worried about longevity of the psu </s>
<s> i see about 200 watts alone for the video card so if we want a 5 year machine we double the watt capability of the psu </s>
<s> that s a bit high at 900 so the psu is an iffy choice here </s>
<s> if you can get another 100 watts and keep the single rail 12v then you should be fine for years </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this is my computer im not sure if this is what you wanted or not </s>
<s> instead of the 430 maybe a 600w </s>
<s> im just worried about the card not being compatible with my motherboard </s>
<s> quot pci express x16 one slot supporting full height cards quot so can you share what made you think it was incompatible </s>
<s> once in a while you see a question about pcie 1 x 2 x etc but the answer can un nerve those that asked </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> while the first psu choice was the minimum and should work i winced at being too close to call </s>
<s> this 600 is a single rail to avoid issues with setup and should get you years of use </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ive had a few bad experiences upgrading video cards on a computer of mine when i was a kid and i didnt know for sure if my motherboard had a pci express 3 0 x16 slot or if that card would fit but thank you for your help </s>
<s> so in conclusion i could upgrade my inspiron successfully with these parts </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> that is what you can check ahead of time by getting the dimensions of the card and measuring </s>
<s> as i don t own this machine all i can write is that it looks ok if you want wait for someone that will assure you further </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i measured and it seems the boost wont fit but the previous one i mentioned will definitely fit in my case </s>
<s> thanks for all your help </s>
