<s> i need to know the signs of a failing power supply </s>
<s> my computer is constantly crashing and locks up then reboots </s>
<s> the power supply is running hot most of the time the fan is working it crashes and reboots the same way with windows xp windows 98se and windows me </s>
<s> the ram tested ok 512mb ddr </s>
<s> the hdd tested ok no errors </s>
<s> i have 2 additional exhaust fans installed </s>
<s> internal system temp is 78f cpu temp is 115f </s>
<s> i shut this computer down and borrowed another computer to use in the mean time </s>
<s> i don t want to risk destroying the motherboard with the power supply shorting out </s>
<s> i haven t taken it in for testing yet but should i consider replacing the power supply anyway </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> with a known good ps </s>
<s> if the reboots stop you have the answer </s>
<s> unfortunely a weak p s unit causes all havoc and just makes the system flaky in general </s>
<s> p s problem can effect all aspects of the system so you really can t trust anything </s>
<s> thus the quickest fix is to replace swap </s>
<s> but you mentioned your heat is hot that alone can effect the p s worthiness as it starts to falter under such conditions </s>
<s> leave the side cover off the system and it seems to settle down you truly got a quot heat problem quot </s>
<s> further you can place a household fan to better cool the innards and it really settles down you found a heat problem </s>
<s> that being the case damage maybe already done and replacement may still be called for on the p s or any other fan s plusa they have to sucking in air and exhausting it as well at a rate capable of cooling the system </s>
<s> air circualation is must to better help air flow through out the system case </s>
<s> a good p s unit should be 400w or better and be a quality build unit as well so pick a namebrand if that what it comes down to </s>
<s> hope this helps enjoy willy </s>
<s> that is if they are valid readings </s>
<s> have you checked for bulging or leaking capacitors </s>
<s> the large ones located around the cpu </s>
<s> what did you test the memory with </s>
<s> for how long </s>
<s> probably much cheaper to put a new supply in than pay someone to check it out </s>
<s> have you done the complete gamut of things to do to eliminate spyware parasites et al </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> take the side cover off and leave it that way </s>
<s> the case is designed to be closed for proper airflow </s>
<s> you will get more dust inside as well </s>
<s> just swap out the power supply and see what happens </s>
<s> what size is you power supply </s>
<s> also look for swolen or leaking capactors on the mother board </s>
<s> any way per a stuff the first thing is to replace the power supply </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> i decided to replace the power supply the computer responded well no problems </s>
<s> i had the system temp sensor tested it was ok it was just the power supply itself that was running hot and malfunctioning </s>
<s> everything is back to normal </s>
<s> it is still running well </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> this was the first time i had a power supply unit fail in my own equipment </s>
<s> this was a great lesson learned </s>
<s> i know what to look for in the future </s>
<s> thanks to everyone </s>
