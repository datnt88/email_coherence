<s> i currently have 3 usb 2 0 hard drives 2x fantom 500gb and a 200gb seagate in a vantec nexus enclosure </s>
<s> the hard drives all work fine when plugged directly into the computer but i recently purchased a vantec ugt mh401 usb hub and when all the drives are plugged in they are painfully slow </s>
<s> for instance extracting a file with 7zip tops out at 400kb s </s>
<s> is this the case with every hub i could purchase or is it a problem with this particular hub </s>
<s> it advertises that it has quot downstream ports have automatic connect and speed detection function plus over current protection with auto recovery quot which i am not sure if that would be a problem this is the product page on newegg </s>
<s> any help is appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> seen that </s>
<s> little to do but try another make and model </s>
<s> my fix at home was to add a 4 port usb 2 0 pci card </s>
<s> that was same or as much money as your hub </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thats what i was thinking i bought the hub to souley to clean up the appearance of the front of my case </s>
<s> also i got the hub because it is externally powered and doesn t suck power from my psu i am not sure if it matters since the hardrives are externally powered themselves though </s>
