<s> did not change anything </s>
<s> i do use msi afterburner and my temps never get higher than 70 running any game </s>
<s> so temperature is not an issue </s>
<s> plus this happens the moment i get into the game so there is a very small window for my gpu to reach overheated temps which i don t think is happening </s>
<s> i really can t find anyone else who has had this exact problem in my video before </s>
<s> highly frustrating </s>
<s> here is another video that shows the problem off better it really seems like it is a graphics card problem but i can t be sure </s>
<s> that s the issue with the pc </s>

<s> this is one of those times </s>
<s> there is one issue i encounter too often </s>
<s> that is those that overclock usually can t be helped </s>
<s> it may upset a few but that s going out on a limb </s>
<s> few will join you </s>
