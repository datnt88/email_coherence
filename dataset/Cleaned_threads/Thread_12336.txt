<s> just got this as a gift from my employers </s>
<s> 64mb flash drive </s>
<s> yay </s>
<s> now what can i do with this </s>
<s> currently i m thinking a few options 1 make it a bootable drive for emergency rescue operations </s>
<s> but which os distro </s>
<s> is there an os that can fit within 64mb </s>
<s> 2 install windows portable apps on it </s>
<s> thinking of abiword for sure what other useful apps you think can fit on it </s>
<s> but i found my older laptop could only boot from 4gb and smaller memory sticks </s>
<s> what i did boot was ubuntu and it did run abiword </s>
<s> ubuntu is less than 1gb which leaves you a lot of open space </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> how long have you worked for him her hehe </s>
<s> or should that be 64gb now that would be nice </s>
<s> do as you would any harddrive </s>
<s> thanks for your reply but it s 64 megabytes only </s>
<s> that s like 10 of a single cd storage </s>
<s> i searched around and looks like damn small linux may be the way to go </s>
<s> worked for this large scale healthcare employer for almost two years now </s>
<s> actually they had to gift something on doctor s day and apparently they came out with this brilliant idea of 64mb flash drive don t know where they purchased them from </s>
<s> now 64mb is a great size for carrying documents and even pictures like patient x ray jpegs etc but i m going to use my 8gb flash drive for that purpose </s>
<s> it s the smallest flash drive i ve ever had and i really want to experiment with it in that how much quot usefulness quot can fit into it </s>
<s> mybad </s>
<s> i haven t seen that size in years </s>
<s> and my oldest stick is 128mb </s>
<s> ok damn small linux it is </s>
<s> has the others </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> 11 years ago it costed 29 99 </s>
<s> never let me down </s>
<s> now it s a bootable pen for any laptop without cd dvd drive </s>
<s> love it </s>
