<s> i bought this hard drive to back up my family s 8 years worth of photos for safe keeping </s>
<s> only 3 days later the drive crashed </s>
<s> i ve contacted toshiba and no matter what they wont stand behind their product </s>
<s> below are the responses i get from them hello unfortunately i cannot help you on this matter </s>
<s> please contact my supervisor for any concerns </s>
<s> sholeen chaudhary toshiba oa dept supervisor schaudhary pcs sj com 510 651 6798 dear customer toshiba is not liable for any loss data </s>
<s> you will need to take it to a data recovery center to have your data removed </s>
<s> regards sholeen chaudhary toshiba oa dept supervisor schaudhary pcs sj com 510 651 6798 i understand their quot liability quot issue all i m asking them is for some help </s>
<s> i have no back ups </s>
<s> i have no other way to retrieve these pictures </s>
<s> i have my baby s photos christmas s soccer games everything i don t know what else to do </s>
<s> i don t have the money to take it to a recoverey center </s>
<s> i just want my pictures back </s>
<s> i wish i would have backed them up on cds or something but i thought an external drive would work best man was i mistaken </s>
<s> i ve tried everything any advice from anyone </s>
<s> i will never buy another toshiba product again </s>
<s> if i can steer one person away from them as well so be it </s>
<s> what happen to customer service </s>
<s> they should replace the drive </s>
<s> that s what they make and will usually make good on that </s>
<s> you have the data </s>
<s> it is your data not theres and you must safeguard it with a backup plan </s>
<s> gt let s go over a good backup plan </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> 3 copies </s>
<s> 2 a copy away from the other 2 copies </s>
<s> if you decide not to maintain backups this is your choice </s>
<s> gt let s note a fine company that you can talk to next gt in closing read that warranty again </s>
<s> it does not cover any data loss </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry about your loss </s>
<s> never have only one copy of anything stored digitally if at all possible </s>
<s> i have so many photos that i could not keep them all on my laptop </s>
<s> moved them to two different external drives so there are two copies </s>
<s> one of the drives is portable and i carry to work each day just per chance something happens at home </s>
<s> next step is to burn to dvds over 50 gb of data so that will be at least 10 12 full dvd rs </s>
<s> but after hearing your story and others i m going to spend the time doing just that </s>
<s> of course the dvds have a shelf life too </s>
<s> as to toshiba s liability i m afraid that no drive maker eve warranties against loss of data only the repair replacement of the hardware </s>
