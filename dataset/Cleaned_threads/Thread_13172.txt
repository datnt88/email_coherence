<s> forum i recently purchased a canon hf11 32gb video camera </s>
<s> i am not willing to install an internal hard drive into my computer that is becoming dated </s>
<s> i figured a 2tb fantom gf2000eu ought to do </s>
<s> am i missing something here or is this the correct solution </s>

<s> many go for such and store files but forget backups </s>
<s> also video editing on usb drives usually takes all the fun out of editing </s>
<s> see bob </s>
<s> bob do you have a recommendation </s>
<s> maybe 2 of these hard drives </s>
<s> and editing software </s>
<s> my old pinnacle is 8 years old and i m sure there is a better editng software </s>
<s> the link you attached is a jpeg </s>
<s> thanks matt </s>
<s> maybe 2 of those drives </s>
<s> that way you sync one to the other </s>
