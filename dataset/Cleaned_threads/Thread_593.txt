<s> so turns out my attempt to upgrade my video card resulted in my frying the motherboard </s>
<s> i see i can get a refurb from dell </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> dell direct replacement should get you going with the least amount of hassle </s>
<s> though excluding any 2ndary issues or continuing problems it will be the least intrusive and you can continue on as if nothing happened </s>

<s> and you can ask questions on this topic later </s>
<s> for now i see no reason not to continue using dell if that suits you </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
