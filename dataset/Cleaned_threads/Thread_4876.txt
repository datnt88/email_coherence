<s> i did several tests with occt and latencymon when i do 100 load to cpu or 100 load to gpu it s working fine when using 100 load on both the same time i got frame rate drop in spikes and hiccups on the 3d rendering i did a latency test with latencymon </s>
<s> it was actually ok i even got less latency under heavy load then with normal use of pc switching between programs gives a short high latency spike though in short how can i make the hiccups and framerate drops dissepear </s>
<s> if you ve been around there is a race between games that tax the hardware and hardware that improves and provides more cpu gpu power </s>
<s> if you reach some plateau then you have to improve or replace the pc or parts </s>
<s> it s a shame you only posted what you did and not the reason you did all this latency testing </s>
<s> in itself it s just a test and doesn t mean there is a real problem to solve </s>
<s> also not a word about your pentium 4 machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ii ll go in more detail i have the problem with games on high settings give this framerate drops and sometimes my pc crashes because of it i was looking on the internet for a possible cause and ended op testing serveral things </s>
<s> i find that i get to check out the machine s power and cooling far sooner than diving into any latency tests </s>
<s> too bad there is so little detail about this pc </s>

<s> my psu average should be 455w it has a 600w ocz zs single rail 12v has 38 amps on it those are calculations i did motherboard is gigabyte ga h67ma usb3 b3 i m using a vga screen not dvi or hdmi samsung e2220n ram kingston 2x2gb khw1600c9d3bik2 4gx processor core i5 2400 hard disk western digital wd1002faex caviar black 3 120mm fans with fan control on the case </s>
<s> i haven t seen short term cooling problems for long term i can t say </s>
<s> video card is a radeon 7870 ghz edition </s>
<s> you always run into clients that tell you how many fans are on the case or quot it s not heat quot i don t see the video could have missed it but you see the 8800 s and others failing now </s>
<s> you asked about latency so let s read this from toms </s>
<s> quot our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a 225 lga 1155 core i5 2500k and a 1000 lga 2011 core i7 3960x even when three way graphics card configurations are involved </s>
<s> it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don t hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge based machines </s>
<s> quot since you have a nearly same cpu and it can drive three cards without much issue your issue must be somewhere else </s>
<s> if it s crashing then you know to try the usual </s>
<s> ask if you didn t know </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> and it gave around 75 176 c at 100 load for one hour </s>
<s> but i ve watched folk run memtest for weeks and still have a memory issue </s>
<s> you bring up a great point </s>
<s> how did this industry get here without decent diagnostics </s>
<s> no i really don t know </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have some knowledge about it but not enough i think so you may spell it out </s>
<s> i missed what video card is in use </s>
<s> when i see such i replace the heat sink compounds as we can t see what the original builder did </s>
<s> be sure to nod and smile at your client but do the work </s>
<s> leave the side cover off and point some fan at it and try again </s>
<s> if it crashes take the inventory of the machine to ask if others are seeing this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for the advice i ll take some time tommorrow to try it out then i ll say what i see </s>
<s> and find out this is an older card or one of the 8400 8600 line </s>
<s> even the 8800 s are failing now </s>
<s> just old cards </s>
<s> some clients morn the loss </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i didn t clean the heatsink yet but i noticed what s the problem here i checked the cpu usage while running the gpu on 100 it only takes 5 to 10 of cpu usage but when my cpu and gpu are 100 loaded he can t do that 5 to 10 cpu usage correctly hence the framerate spike drops i do get this problem with games because it probably taxes my cpu too much as well i thought he would just lower the framerate of th gpu to compensate the load on the cpu but apperently i m wrong </s>
<s> tdp of the cpu is probably the cause of my pc crashing </s>
<s> quot video card is a radeon 7870 ghz edition quot </s>
<s> see 5th message in string </s>
<s> it s obviously a buggy machine </s>
<s> ask the maker seller what to exchange </s>
<s> sure you could do the usual bios and driver updates and hope but this one is back to it s makers since it s failing when new </s>
