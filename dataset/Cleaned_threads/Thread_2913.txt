<s> after using select all copy paste to create larger mov files from 2 smaller ones the movies do not contain the resource files qt reports quot cannot find file quot name of file quot same happens after using quot add audio file quot via the edit menu </s>
<s> previous these operations worked 100s of times </s>
<s> is this due to corrupt prefs </s>
<s> if so which one </s>
<s> using a mac pro 10 6 7 w 8 gb ram </s>
<s> no other problems </s>
<s> tia for any help </s>
<s> is no longer being used by the system </s>
<s> if i remember correctly snow leopard did number on qt pro and replaced it with qt x you can reinstall it though p </s>
<s> sorry thanks for the attempt to help </s>
<s> but qt quot 7 quot is installed in the utilities folder quot under quot snow leopard </s>
<s> i have been using qt pro that extra cost feature carries forward so that registered paid users can continue to use qt pro for basic movie editing since i upgraded to 10 6 about 6 months ago </s>
<s> unless what you say is a more recent development users should still be able to use qt 7 pro for basic editing </s>
<s> apple did this split off because they have a large number of customers who paid for the qt 7 pro app and need it for actual movie editing tasks which are not available in imovie for example </s>
<s> it gets a little complicated because imovie has a different way of doing the voice overs and it to my knowledge cannot join short clips into a single larger clip </s>
<s> so if you have specific information about using imovie or any mac app for these tasks i d appreciate knowing about it </s>
<s> which you can then export as qt movies </s>
<s> i had qt pro which i lost somewhere between leopard and lion p </s>
<s> has been located thanks to your comment and appears to be alive and well on my lion machine </s>
<s> check to see if your version still shows a pro </s>
<s> it may need the activation number again to kick it back into life just a thought p </s>
<s> thanks but yes i check the status every time i upgrade either os or qt version </s>
<s> i d bet the problem lies with prefs plists but unless i know which one to delete i m hesitant </s>
<s> in fact qt pro will still export to different file formats from mov just converted one audio mov file to aif with no trouble </s>
<s> but it won t do the two common operations i ve described and need </s>
<s> i have worked around the immediate problem bought imovie 11 from the mac app store and will be trying its new audio editing features which apple dropped after imovie hd </s>
