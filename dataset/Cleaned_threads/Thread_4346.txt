<s> well it was bound to happen sometime about 5 months ago my dvd rom was incapable of reading dvds for a short period of time just as i was trying to show something to someone but it was apparently just 1 dvd that it had a problem with and no others </s>
<s> however now first it couldn t read dvd rs which it formerly could then it could no longer read anything cds or dvds </s>
<s> and thats where i am stuck now </s>
<s> my drive is a mt1316b bdv212b or so the drivers say however i know its a 8x or it was when i bought it many many years ago bdv tells me it should be a 12x go figure </s>
<s> anyways what i mainly wonder is that my friend has a cd dvd drive cleaner and it would be great if i could test it out however my drive is currently incapable of even detecting whether the disk in the drive is a dvd or a cd and wont allow me to run the program to have it access track 3 where the brushes on the cd are question 1 is there a program i could use to make the drive spin up and move the lazer around to possibly clean it </s>
<s> question 2 is thereany other suggestions someone might have for possible fixes </s>
<s> or any possible answers as to why this happened </s>
<s> i ve always used the drive lightly </s>
<s> question 1 is there a program i could use to make the drive spin up and move the lazer around to possibly clean it </s>
<s> there are cleaner kits that you reach in and swap the lens </s>
<s> question 2 is thereany other suggestions someone might have for possible fixes </s>
<s> or any possible answers as to why this happened </s>
<s> i ve always used the drive lightly i replace the drive since it s a commodity item and repair of those drives are not possible </s>
<s> no vendor schematics no spare parts and tech time exceeds the cost of a drive every time </s>
<s> some want to fix the drive but its best to let them figure out that such isn t going to happen </s>
<s> usually they rack up phone bills greater than the cost of the new drive before it sinks in </s>
<s> i hope this reply will hurry your epiphany </s>
<s> your story is typical with some dvd type being hard to read and then it degrades further </s>
<s> the laser loses power and soon nothing works </s>
<s> try a cd lens cleaner new firmware and then change the drive </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> thanks for the info but as usual i m looking away from spendng a single penny on this and really dont have the money to replace the drive </s>
<s> ok well i lied i have the money currently but dont wanna spend it on a dvd rom drive 16x dvd rom that reads all formats 40 45 </s>
<s> 4x 2x 8x dvd r drive that can make 1 4gb cds 106 it dont seem worth buying the dvd rom will save up for the dvd writer </s>
<s> the cd lens cleaner thing or swab is the usual </s>
<s> i ve resurrected 1 drive by finding latest firmware </s>
<s> but with such a low success rate i wonder if it should be on quot the list quot the cost of having quot tech quot update the firmware on a dvd rom exceeds what you can buy a dvd r w in just a few weeks </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i use a cd cleaning disk which will play an animated cartoon while cleaning </s>
<s> that means its cleaning and reading the cartoon and supposely gives a quot thumbs up quot in being readable </s>
<s> its by alstop or allsop makers </s>
<s> the price is less than 8us and available in most stores </s>
<s> as for the cds themselves use a cleaner for them as well </s>
<s> greasy or sticky fingers can play havoc overtime so its worth it to get a device that cleans disks </s>
<s> plus a can of air to blow out any dust as well </s>
<s> note cd drives no matter what type will fail sooner or later but a quality drive tends to last longer </s>
<s> also users using a dvd drive to read plain cds may find getting replacing a std </s>
<s> cd drive read only so when it fails the cost is cheaper to replace plus you keep the more expensive dvd or cd rw drives for those tasks alone </s>
<s> that s my 2 cents willy </s>
