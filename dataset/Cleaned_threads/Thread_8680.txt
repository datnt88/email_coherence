<s> i m already running one wd 250gb sata drive on my ecs k8m800 m2 v1 0 motherboard without any problems </s>
<s> i ve just bought another drive a wd 160gb sata wd1600aajs 3 0gb s and can t get it running </s>
<s> it ought to be the simplest thing i just plugged it in but when i reboot i get nothing </s>
<s> it ll sit there in post and grind away forever and nothing happens </s>
<s> i swear the drive is running i can feel it in my hand </s>
<s> mine s an old motherboard so i remembered to set the 5 6 jumper to do only 1 5gb s </s>
<s> if i plug the new drive in everything just hangs when trying to read the drives when i unplug it everything s fine again and windows starts up </s>
<s> i ve tested my sata cables and the slots on the motherboard they all work in any configuration i want when using the old hard drive it s only when i plug in the new one that things fall apart </s>
<s> it ll eventually go to windows but windows won t see the new drive no matter what i do </s>
<s> the bios and chipset are both updated </s>
<s> my western digital hard drive utilities see only one drive so it s definitely just not there </s>
<s> i ve gotten a dead drive in the mail before but it was completely dead not running at all </s>
<s> this one hums like it wants to work i just can t get it to cooperate </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> check the simple stuff first any jumpers cables tight seated bios enabled for that port </s>
<s> now it may be possible a bios update is required if so check to see what the update does </s>
<s> in other words see if it addresses that problem or any other if known </s>
<s> since you stated the mtrbd </s>
<s> is older it may need more than one in order to keep up to date </s>
<s> if any bios update prepare for it you have 1 chance as this is a serious step proceed when ready </s>
<s> to test new hd mount it alone </s>
<s> remove current old hd mount new on </s>
<s> set it up for use and have any s w from wd that helps in this regard </s>
<s> wd uses the dataguard setup s w get it from the wd support website if you don t have it and be sure its for your type model hd </s>
<s> get the helpguide from support as well it explains details </s>
<s> also be ready it may need the sata s w from the xp cd if you don t already have that as a separate item maybe </s>
<s> testing the hd alone eliminates any possible boo boo to the working hd and you re dealing the problem alone </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> what happens if you use the connections cables from the working drive </s>
<s> that motherboard only supports sata i drives </s>
<s> there is a bug in the chipset that prevents sata ii 300mbps drives from reverting to sata i mode </s>
<s> you can make it work by manually setting the drive to sata i most drives have a jumper or internal setting to accomplish this for exactly this purpose </s>
<s> see the drive manufacturer s website to find out how </s>
<s> you may have to download a utility program and find a machine to run it on to set the drive up the way you need </s>
