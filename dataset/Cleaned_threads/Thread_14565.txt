<s> i m looking to buy a video capture card combo e g </s>
<s> ati all in wonder or similar </s>
<s> my friend has the old 128mb agp version and it works for them and from what i ve seen it s gotten great reviews </s>
<s> but i want 256mb i need the pci e format </s>
<s> currently i have a very cheapo capture card and video card and wish to upgrade both at the same time </s>
<s> i need to get a 256mb 2006 pci e version of the card i don t have an agp slot but it seems to have gotten more bad reviews than good </s>
<s> i don t know of any other options for the same combo technology either </s>
<s> does anyone have any comments on this card 2006 pci e version or any other suggestions to getting another combo card for roughly the same price </s>
<s> i am also worried about its integration w winxp mce 2005 </s>
<s> your new card will mention mce or it won t be compatible </s>
<s> mce is that way </s>
<s> also i ve regretted combo vga and capture cards </s>
<s> i no longer do that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what do you regret about getting the combo just a bad experience or inefficient or something else </s>
<s> right now i have a powercolor tul theater 550 pro tv tuner with on board nvidia 6100 so i would think i d only be able to move up even if it s s combo </s>
<s> not saying i couldn t be wrong though </s>
<s> with the next upgrade i would lose the tv card </s>
<s> since picking up the ati and hauppauge cards i haven t had to replace them </s>
<s> the cards also tended to be larger and hotter </s>
<s> and there is so little difference in sd tv card image quality that it s not worth changing </s>
<s> you can read and see this issue as you tune a hdtv to sd programming </s>
<s> all the warts show up </s>
