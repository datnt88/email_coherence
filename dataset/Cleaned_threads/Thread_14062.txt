<s> just got a tenda w311u wireless network adapter its plug in to my pc and the speed is showing 72mbps just like to know if that is consided to be fast or could i get other adapters that would make it faster than 72mbps </s>
<s> that s a nice number but it means very little </s>
<s> wireless is half duplex so even with a single machine you and the router will transmit over the top of each other and causes packet loss </s>
<s> the so called speed will stay the same but when you have to retransmit the data multiple times the actual thoughtput tends to be much less </s>
<s> when you start running more machines and have random interference from things who can say </s>
<s> still there is not a lot of difference between brands because the key thing that would make it better ie transmit power is regulated by the government </s>
<s> many thnaks for getting back to me and a happy new year to you </s>
