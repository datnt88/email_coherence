<s> hi all ive always used mac desktops because i prefer osx and windows laptops because i could never justify the price of mac portables but the time has come for a desktop upgrade because my imac is struggling with my lightroom library and photoshop use also the tiny hard drive is pretty much full to the brim and has died on me once already </s>
<s> im still trying to decide between the top of the range 27 inch imac or a custom build pc now if you just go by specs the pc would walk all over the mac in every department but in the real world what would be faster </s>
<s> specs of the pc comes in under 163 1000 intel i7 2600k 3 4ghz or ivybridge asrock z68 extreme3 gen3 mobo corsair vengeance 8gb 1600mhz ram mushkin chronos 120gb ssd for boot and lightroom 1tb wd caviar black nvidia gtx 570 24 inch display and the mac 163 1649 intel i5 3 1ghz 4gb 1333mhz ram 1tb hdd amd radeon 6970m either machine will be primarily used for photoshop lightroom itunes dxo optics pro photomatix pro and the rest of the cs5 master collection which would you choose try to forget the os i think osx is far superior but i m sure i could get used to windows 7 being on my primary machine anyway </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> because no one i know has compared those 2 machines </s>
<s> the apple gets a boost from being finely tuned and all the parts are matched to the os and the apps </s>
<s> your common home built pc often suffers from a botched os install or a newbie that didn t understand what drivers are needed or the maker didn t tell them </s>
<s> if you want to learn about windows driver hell build a pc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> without a doubt the pc will go faster </s>
<s> yea sometimes osx does get a slight boost in some applications as seen here simply because it is a much lighter os than windows </s>
<s> however the pc has outright better hardware </s>
<s> if you installed windows and osx on the same amchine you might notice a small difference however the pc has a processor that runs at a faster clock speed and is multithreaded and the gtx 570 will blow that mobile card out of the water </s>
<s> not to mention having twice as much ram at a faster speed and a 120 gb ssd </s>
<s> so that should more than compensate for the lt 3 boost from running osx </s>
<s> i think you could not install any drivers at all and the pc would still run faster for the most part but apparently some people think using windows is too complicated or you could get the pc an use linux which is lighter than windows and thus you would be faster than either solution and save you 100 on linux </s>
