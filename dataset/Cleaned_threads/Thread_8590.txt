<s> bob as in r proffitt </s>
<s> i read in another post that you said there were issuses with me and external dvd r w drives but it could be done </s>
<s> what are they and how can you work around them </s>
<s> i was thinking about doing just that and now i wonder if i should </s>
<s> the issues are </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> 4 gigabyte filesize limit in fat32 </s>
<s> no fix ever for this one </s>
<s> why its a limitation is that you won t be able to make an iso image to make a dvd </s>
<s> let me clarify that this will not stop you from creating dvds but a few tricks and methods will not be available to you </s>
<s> 2 resources 64 thousand bytes video editing is cpu intensive but some software packages have thrown in the towel on dos based windows and don t run at all on 95 98 me </s>
<s> again no fix ever for the 64 thousand pools of memory called resources for windows 95 98 me </s>
<s> again this only limits what you can do </s>
<s> not a stop </s>
<s> best of luck bob </s>
<s> ok bob as you can tell i don t know much </s>
<s> what is a quot iso image quot </s>
<s> what i want to do is use this as a way to make backups on my two computers </s>
<s> one runnung xp and the other me </s>
<s> can i do that with out a lot of trouble </s>
<s> the iso image is best researched at google but in one sentance it s a file that contains all of a cd dvd image ready for your cd dvd recording software to use </s>
<s> since today s dvd can be 4 7gb you can see that you won t be able to create that </s>
<s> as to backup of files you should be fine </s>
