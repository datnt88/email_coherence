<s> i am torn between the dell inspiron 530s and 531s </s>
<s> prices have dropped putting both in a similar category </s>
<s> cnet has only reviewed the 531s </s>
<s> is that the best choice </s>
<s> it s a standard 64bit setup </s>
<s> if a name means that much to you then buy either one </s>
<s> i think there is a difference </s>
<s> the last time i looked one of them was amd based and the other was intel based </s>
<s> i have also been wondering which to choose </s>
<s> i hope someone else will reply about the merits of intel vs amd for a desktop like these </s>
<s> like i said i wouldn t buy either because they are slimline form factor and while reduced footprint has it s initial appeal it later means problems adding internal drives or higher performance peripherals video comes to mind not to mention the reduced form factor reduced output psus </s>
<s> cooling is another problems users often face using slim lines </s>
<s> recognizing those limitations and forgoing hope of adding internals or gpus a slimline might work for you </s>
<s> not me </s>
<s> you can buy which ever you prefer however intel is clearly the better choice from a performance energy use and heat generation </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> make sure you get a model with a core 2 duo if you can at all justify it </s>
<s> it s a lot faster and the earlier cpus usually can t handle 64 bit code should you choose to migrate to vista 64 bit or its sequel in 2009 2010 </s>
<s> the 531s is similar in other regards but the athlon 64 x2 just isn t as fast </s>
<s> also if you re looking at going slimline don t rule out a mac mini unless you need windows specific programs or you can t justify getting their mac equivalents for most people this just means a cheap copy of office student teacher edition at 150 </s>
<s> it s much smaller than the inspiron or even the hp box and more power efficient too </s>
<s> arguably you re going to have an easier time with the full size inspiron 530 if you re just looking for an inexpensive tower </s>
<s> i would disagree to a point </s>
<s> if you are going to get a slim model get what you want now instead of adding on later as adding peripherals can cause problems </s>
<s> i have a slim model c521 and love it </s>
<s> if space is a factor and or you don t want bulky it is the way to go and they are a powerful unit if you don t go cheap at the start </s>
<s> amd vs intel </s>
<s> once again it is up to you </s>
<s> i have both intel and amd and love both </s>
<s> i enjoy the amd for gaming as i have it overclocked and does the job well </s>
<s> i use my intel for work with multi tasking and does the job well </s>
<s> it comes down to the brand bang for the buck </s>
<s> everything is so competitive today </s>
<s> i hate to burst your bubble but archtecture has a certain set of flags </s>
<s> amd64 and emt64 have the same flags with the differences only in the naming of a few </s>
<s> if you had a computer with a choice of sparc64 mips64 ppc g4 arm64 or anything with a 64 128 bit address then i would say quot go for the sparc quot </s>
<s> you have a choice for the quot slimline quot form factor but it isn t neccesary </s>
<s> there are normal sized choices for both </s>
<s> i prefer the 530 because of intel </s>
<s> intel based pc s have a reputation for lasting longer and running cooler </s>
<s> go with the 530 that s what i m doing </s>
