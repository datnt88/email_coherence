<s> i just recently built my own pc </s>
<s> i bought the dfi 648fx ale motherboard and a pentium 4 2 6ghz w 800mhz front side bus speed procesor </s>
<s> the motherboard can support an 800mhz fsb speed yet when i run pcmark04 it reads my fsb bus speed as 200mhz </s>
<s> i cannot find anywhere in the bios where to change it and i do not believe my motherboard has any fsb speed jumpers </s>
<s> i would hate to think that my pc is running alot slower than it could thank you for your help </s>
<s> ohh yeah i have phoenix bios </s>
<s> quot pcmark04 it reads my fsb bus speed as 200mhz quot i ve found that some programs can t report this reliably over the few thousand makes models of pcs </s>
<s> you can try cpuid or cpuidz you can find with and if it gives a different answer contact the authors as to why that happens </s>
<s> but more to the point the supplier of your machine should answer your inquiry about the jumper settings if there are any </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> is running at 800 mhz </s>
<s> you are using ddr memory double data rate two reads writes per clock cycle on one memory bus thus 400 mhz </s>
<s> your mobo has two memory busses for use with dual channel memory </s>
<s> thus if you have two sticks of quot matched quot memory sticks plugged into the proper memory sockets you would have two memory busses feeding the mch and then the cpu each bus double data rate </s>
<s> thus you get 4 memory reads writes oversimplified at 200 mhz which 800 mhz </s>
<s> i only have one stick of 512 ddr ram so i need another </s>
<s> sticks of ddr sdram </s>
<s> quot matched quot just means two sticks of the same size and speed </s>
<s> your mobo probably has two sets of different color ram sockets </s>
<s> either a total of four or six sockets </s>
<s> to use dual channel one stick must be in the first slot of each color </s>
<s> keep in mind that your fsb will still be 200 mhz </s>
<s> just the way that the mobo mfrs deignate things the cpu will be running at 800 mhz memory speed </s>
<s> the memory must be ddr 400 or faster also known as pc 3200 </s>
<s> it is actually 200 mhz memory that gets double clocked thus is called ddr 400 kind of confusing isn t it the stick that you have now must be that or better in order for the system to show an fsb of 200 mhz </s>
<s> this info should be in the manual that came with your mobo </s>
<s> it is not always too clearly written due to the quot pidgen english quot used by the taiwanise authors </s>
<s> hopefully my explanation will help to clarify it a little </s>
<s> support the 800 mhz fsb processor speed </s>
<s> the socket will accept the 800 mhz processor but the highest cpu fsb supported is 533 mhz </s>
<s> it does not have dual channel memory capability </s>
<s> thus disregard my other posts </s>
