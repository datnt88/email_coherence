<s> i have an old desktop pc that i haven t touched in months </s>

<s> jake </s>
<s> i have had the same problem in the past and now </s>
<s> my old pentium 233mx windows 98 se with 128mb of ram a 1 2 gb harddrive </s>
<s> the first time the 166mx processor burned up </s>
<s> it was under warranty at that time </s>
<s> the second time the power supply went out </s>
<s> now my motherboard is fried </s>
<s> i will have to get a new motherboard and new case and start all over again </s>
<s> in your case it can be your processor out or something else </s>
<s> if your have friends who know a lot about computers that would be your best bet </s>
<s> for them to check it out </s>
<s> my experience has been that the power supply is old hungry and sipped from its final water hole </s>
<s> you can try blowing it out with a can of compressed air </s>
<s> take the cover off and clean it out </s>
<s> use a soft thin paint brush on the fan blades and components </s>
<s> it s worth a try </s>
<s> but if lights are going on real low voltage and no fans are turning well oh replace the battery on the motherboard </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
