<s> hi i have a 2tb external hard drive connected to my desktop a few days ago when i was trying to open a folder on the drive in says quot xyz not accessible the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable quot </s>
<s> is there a way i can fix the problem with this problem i m using windows 7 home premium </s>
<s> i d boot my ubuntu cd it s live </s>
<s> and see if i can get in there before any data recovery apps are used </s>
<s> link about gt at the top of this forum is the lost and found welcome post where you will find apps for free free to try and recovery services </s>

<s> after you tried the ubunty trick to copy the files in folder out maybe better copy all files to your backup 2 tb drive you can try a chkdsk on the drive to do the necessary repairs </s>
<s> a full chkdisk including surface check after that won t harm at all </s>
<s> if it happens repeatedly this might point to a hardware issue or to you handling this drive incorrectly </s>
<s> let s hope it was a one time glitch that won t happen again the next 5 years </s>
<s> kees </s>
