<s> hi guys at first i m new to this forum so excuse me if i put this discussion in the wrong area first the story i bought a netgear wn3000rp extender for better wifi range because on my room upstairs i have no signal at all so called dead spots so i installed it a few months ago and all was working fine untill we had to leave the house for vancation </s>
<s> someone in the house pulled the extender out of the electric outlet </s>
<s> a few weeks later we pulled it back in it but here started the problem i installed the extender again but now without any succes </s>
<s> just incase you want take a look there are 4 led lights attached to this extender </s>
<s> 3 of them are lighting but the 4th won t light at all </s>
<s> led s i did the exact same procedures as exampled in the installation manual but nothing worked </s>
<s> i always got this error on the end of the unsuccesful installation move the extender closer to the existing router or gateway </s>
<s> im really sure the extender is in the range of my actual router </s>
<s> i ve tried everything from restoring to factory defaults to wps dps disabling security nothing works i always get stuck on the error </s>
<s> with wps i press both the buttons on the extender and the router but they cant find each other </s>
<s> i hope someone can help me </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i read all this and bottom line this didn t work and as such you pack it up and return it </s>
<s> since it worked at one time it s possible the replacement will work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so you mean return the extender and get a new one </s>
<s> i always hate these boxes that say just push a button and it works </s>
<s> if you can t make it work using wps then you do it the old school way and configure it with ethernet cable like any other extender </s>
<s> if it still does not work then you need to consider it is broken </s>
<s> it could be as simple as wps is disabled on your router note it is strongly recommended you leave wps disabled and only enable for a tiny period of time when you need it </s>
<s> there is a fundamental design flaw that allows a hacker to get access to any router with this enabled </s>
<s> it s possible someone forgot to turn wps on again </s>
<s> but given the story it seems this unit has indeed failed </s>
<s> as there is no user diagnostics to be found and testing such as a shop is cost prohibitive then you hope it s under warranty </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> turn the router security off and then follow the set up for the extender </s>
