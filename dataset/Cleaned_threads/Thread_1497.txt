<s> it is in the basement living room about 15 from the couch </s>
<s> i want a quality wireless keyboard that won t make me bankrupt my current wireless keyboard does not work at the range </s>
<s> one feature i would be interested in is any kind of illumination glow in the dark backlight whatever </s>
<s> if it is a gaming keyboard that would be just fine as long as it does not cost a fortune </s>
<s> a gaming keyboard is not necessary but preferable </s>
<s> i have looked at iogear and they have a keyboard with a 33 range i just don t know how well it would work and i don t need the mouse that comes with it i have a logitech g7 mouse </s>

<s> their wireless k350 looks really nice but i need to know if its range is good enough </s>
<s> priorities 1 works well long range quality </s>
<s> 2 some kind of illumination </s>
<s> 3 gaming grade </s>
