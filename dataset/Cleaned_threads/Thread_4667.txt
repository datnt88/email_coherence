<s> hi i am planning on getting a new video card since my old nvidia geforce fx 5200 is fried after i overclocked it and i m wondering if anyone can tell me if a nvidia geforce fx 5700ve is a killer card for gaming </s>
<s> i mean if it is would it be better than a 5700le or a 5700 ultra </s>
<s> by the way the card is pny brand </s>
<s> an fx 5700ve and no it wouldn t be a killer card for gaming consider something like a geforce 6600gt or maybe a 6800nu if you have the cash for it i d avoid radeon x series with the exception of radeon x1800 but that s really expensive vs the performance it offers </s>
<s> and capability </s>
<s> i m pretty well pleased with my geforce 6200tc </s>
<s> i just gave 47 dollars for it at newegg and am surprised how well it plays games </s>
<s> but of course how well any card plays depends greatly on system specs </s>
<s> a 5700 ultra is generally much costlier than the cards of the same number and if you are going to spend 120 to 160 or so i certainly look at a geforce 6600gt </s>
<s> now i know that 6600gt and 6800 are way better than my 5700ve but they are overpriced </s>
<s> i am looking for something that costs like 5700ve around 120 140 bucks but couldn t find 6600gt or 6800 video cards with these prices anywhere </s>
<s> but if cant afford try going for a vanilla 6600 it is just a tad bit slower than the 6600gt and is much better than the 5200 so u should see an improvement </s>
<s> you said you have about 140 so get the geforce 6600gt from newegg </s>
<s> you will not regret it unless your e looking forward to playing games with 1434 fps with outstainding ultra maximum anti aliasing </s>
<s> oh and make sure your power supply is good </s>
<s> i ve heard people say not enough power supply and the old power supply might die </s>
