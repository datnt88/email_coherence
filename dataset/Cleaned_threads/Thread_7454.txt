<s> hello this is my first thread on the cnet forums </s>
<s> anyway i plan on buying a netbook pretty soon which is the asus eee pc 1005 hab which includes windows xp </s>
<s> i plan on using it for itunes backup storage maybe some school work but i think the main focus is for itunes </s>
<s> can the netbook i mentioned be used without problems </s>
<s> will itunes be limited because of the netbook hardware </s>
<s> i know you cant watch hd or sd video play itunes extras and whatnot but can i use itunes for ipod management like restoring and downgrading and whatnot </s>
<s> also just a personal preference but can you change the color of the xp taskbar from the blue color </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> it does that fine </s>
<s> yes you may have to be patient for some operations but it does work </s>
<s> my nephew has an emachines 250 1162 netbook and an ipod nano which he uses all the time </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the response </s>
<s> can i still change the wallpaper or the color of the xp taskbar though </s>
<s> there are plentiful discussions about windows 7 basic and how to change the wallpaper in spite of how it arrives </s>
<s> i bet the color of the taskbar is covered too </s>
<s> as to windows xp no version i know of has such a limitation or needs any work around </s>
