<s> hopefully this is the right spot for this </s>
<s> i m hoping someone can read this and help me straighten this out </s>
<s> any help is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> a quick background of the situation </s>
<s> up until about 5 6 years ago we had a camera that took film and we got pictures developed and that was it </s>
<s> since then we have a digital camera smart phones tablets and we take more pictures and video than ever </s>
<s> i usually have to back up everyone s stuff from the phones and cameras </s>
<s> some of these digital pics we print </s>
<s> a lot of them we don t need to print but we share and want to keep them </s>
<s> now everyone will be super angry if i ever lost anything so i ve backed all up onto 2 usb hard drives and a copy on the computer </s>
<s> i been doing a lot of sharing and backup through windows for a long time this way </s>
<s> my problem is i have to make this simpler and more efficient </s>
<s> i can fix a computer and i m technical with stuff but i never did any real server backup type things </s>
<s> hopefully someone with experience and knowledge can steer me in the right direction </s>
<s> i was looking into freenas raid and amahi greyhole and i peeked at windows home server drive extender </s>
<s> i ve read a lot but i m not sure which way to go </s>
<s> maybe there is better options </s>
<s> here s what i quot like quot to do i have an available pc that s ready to be wiped and configured </s>
<s> if a mac would be better for whatever reason ill get one </s>
<s> but i like to keep the cost down </s>
<s> i like to have an easy somewhat way for everyone to back up their own stuff in an organized fashion and have all info duplicated </s>
<s> so if one hard drive fails the info is recoverable </s>
<s> the raid weirds me out a little because if a drive fails do you need an exact same drive to replace </s>
<s> same manufacturer </s>
<s> or just any drive that same size or bigger </s>
<s> that s where i was quot kinda quot liking quot greyhole and drive extender quot </s>
<s> also a way to share anything local and remote </s>
<s> oh if possible i would like to have another machine at a family members house where they can do the same and we can backup each others stuff remotely on a schedule </s>
<s> again i appreciate and help </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> that is commonly employed by businesses with multiple users is a centralized network storage </s>
<s> budgets determine how high in performance scalability fault tolerance and backups they can go </s>
<s> home administrators can employ a modest configuration within consumer budgets </s>
<s> avoid low end nas they are too slow </s>
<s> get a gigabit network and put a file server and all your users on it </s>
<s> if you know how to run linux your server os is free otherwise use wxp pro or w7pro for easier operation than home premium editions </s>
<s> it would be too exhausting to describe quot how to quot in this post so read up about networked file server and use your spare pc to experiment </s>
<s> one last tip a 24 7 server can chew up a lot of electricity so a low energy cpu like atom and 2 5 quot 5400rpm disk drives will help mitigate the bills </s>
<s> you don t need high speed pc hardware to achieve good file server performance for a few users at home </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> backup is a system of more than just a network drive </s>
<s> it s been well discussed you must have an offline set to safeguard against a rogue app or user </s>
<s> with that out of the way i upgraded my router to one with a nas feature netgear n600 wndr3800 and plugged in a small form usb 500gb hdd </s>
<s> it s been out there for months without issue </s>
<s> it also does not take much power which i find most folk forget about </s>
<s> some folk think using an old pc would cut the costs but at the usual 100 or more watts it taxes them for years </s>
<s> so my solution is best for home use doesn t draw much more than 1 watt and for software i use syncback most of the time </s>
<s> that s the end of the online step </s>
<s> for offline i sync this with another drive then what i can t lose fits onto usb memory sticks </s>
<s> bob </s>
