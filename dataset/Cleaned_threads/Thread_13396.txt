<s> so while removing the hard drive on my brother s asus eee 1005hab </s>
<s> i on accident lost the little black clips that holds it in place </s>
<s> does anyone have any tips on how to fix this </s>
<s> my first instinct is vinyl electrical tape but i m worried what will happen if it melts or by some odd turn an arc or something </s>
<s> the connector is the one that holds they touchpad in place so it s quite small </s>
<s> any tips </s>
<s> many of those parts end up there </s>
<s> cheaper than the entire board </s>
<s> i tend to use quot shipping tape quot the one with the string in it </s>
<s> besides being strong you can cut it along its length and use the strip to wrap place or tape down quot something quot </s>
<s> it s certainly isn t electrically conductive and sticky and strong and seems to work </s>
<s> of course you handle it the best you can and don t buy cheap tape either </s>
<s> on some quick fix repairs i have used quot clear labels quot used for mailing or folder labels clear seem to be easy to work with and strong enough until a permanent fix is done or left alone </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
