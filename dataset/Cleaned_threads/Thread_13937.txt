<s> hi a small business in my town recently got new ibm pcs </s>
<s> they then upgraded from win98se to winxp pro </s>
<s> they took all of there networking configuration from 98se and entered them into xp pro </s>
<s> the host pc has an ip address of 192 168 0 12 the other three are 13 14 11 all subnet masks are set to 255 255 255 0 default gateway is set to 192 168 1 1 there are 3 shared folders g h p </s>
<s> when the non hosts try to access info on g a message shows that this drive is set as quot read only quot </s>
<s> h and p can be accessed with no trouble </s>
<s> this happens when the non host pc users are trying to access word perfect files on g </s>
<s> also when the files are edited on the host pc the other pcs don t see the change </s>
<s> we have tried to remove the read only status but it doesn t stick </s>

<s> the default gateway is not on the lan </s>
<s> look at the numbers and there s an error right there </s>
<s> you may respond quot it worked before quot but it s still an error </s>
<s> as to the read only thing xp is a new ball game with quot users and permissions quot the xp that is serving will have to have the users added with the same passwords as on the client machines </s>

<s> i can t know this one </s>
<s> i can tell that without added route add commands given the lan netmask is 255 255 255 0 and the lan ips are in the 192 168 1 x range then that gateway is that quot x quot value from 1 to 254 but i can t tell with the supplied info which machine it is </s>
<s> i m only pointing out this is a flawed entry with the information supplied </s>
<s> my hunch is that the new way of nt 2000 xp 2003 and that users have to be added to each machine can be daunting until you get it all entered on each machine </s>
