<s> i am thinking about getting a usb modem from verizon for my home internet </s>
<s> i was wondering if there was a wireless router out there that could use one of these as an internet input </s>
<s> that way me and my wife could use it at the same time </s>
<s> any such beast in existence </s>
<s> just recently i used my droid easythether a windows 7 netbook ics and a router to do this </s>
<s> i must decline all the details since to do this you must be able to take the clues i offered and run with it or it s not a solution for you </s>
<s> i bet something similar could be rigged up using your laptop and a common router but again unless you have a firm grasp on networking this is not a solution </s>
<s> try this </s>
<s> goto 3grouter com and see if that is what you want </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i found out verizon sells quot mobile hotspots quot which sound like just what i want </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> a few thoughts on it </s>
<s> 1 beware the caps </s>
<s> if you exceed you byte limits it s very expensive </s>
<s> 2 they do not discount the plan on this </s>
<s> my droid costs me less per month than the wifi mobile hotspot without a cap for now </s>
<s> 3 there were some that made claims the units overheat but mine ran 24x7 and was fine for the weeks we used it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am looking into this as a temp source of inet for the next 6 months </s>
<s> we are renting a house for 6 months and pickings are slim there </s>
<s> sat expensive dial up yea right or cell use </s>
<s> verizons 3g is really good there </s>
<s> since it is only 6 months i am not going with a 2 year plan which means it will not be really be cheap either way </s>
<s> any other good ideas out there </s>
<s> ask verizon if you are in their 4g coverage area </s>
<s> they are going live today dec 5 with their lte system </s>
<s> i have used this when they were testing and it is very fast we were streaming ie transmitting hidef video from a moving car </s>
<s> work very well considering that you cannot buffer outgoing live video </s>
<s> have not had time to read the fine print on their contract but they implied they were going to offer a tiered plan so you could by what you need </s>
<s> sprint clear if you can get it offers a true unlimited 4g plan but in theory lte will be faster but we will see who is telling the truth </s>
<s> there are air card rentals like rovair </s>
<s> but why not look at the six months and cost in breaking the contract </s>
<s> just pay the man for the breakup and what does that work out for the six months </s>
<s> here i got a discount on the droid and it costs less than the hotspot </s>
<s> i m keeping this one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for all the ideas </s>
<s> no i will not be living in 4g land </s>
<s> i will look into rentals though </s>
