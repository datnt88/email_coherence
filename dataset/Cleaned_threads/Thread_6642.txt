<s> does somebody know how to deal with this problem </s>
<s> i have a benq external cd rw usb device and the notebook recognizes it as an usb optical storage </s>
<s> i tried it in a desktop and it does the same thing </s>
<s> i cant even install the driver because it does not found the device or because windows looks for a driver of a usb data storage </s>
<s> thank you in advance </s>
<s> only 2 versions of windows might see it as a cdrw </s>
<s> all others see such as drive as quot usb optical storage quot to use the drive i add software such as you find at bob </s>
<s> thank you for the reply but i do not see how can a burning software remedy this problem </s>
<s> the site does not have any help on this problem and it seems that the software hasnt been tested on any external benq yet </s>
<s> windows most versions does not know a cdrw drive from a cd drive </s>
<s> many are unaware of this and fall into a trap of quot it shouldn t be this way quot for some period of time </s>
<s> i ll wait for you to figure that out </s>
<s> in the meantime if you want to create a cdr or cdrw disk the software i noted is free to try out </s>

<s> the problem is that the device was working ok and after the same cable was used to connect a digital camera with the computer it did not work anymore since it recognizes the drive as optical storage and does not read any kind of cd </s>
<s> it seems to me that the device does not communicate at all with the computer it must be it since there is no driver for the cd rw drive </s>
<s> while i may wonder why you didn t write this in your first post i now just ask you to ignore any reply up to this point and hope someone else sees a solution </s>
<s> to me the drive sounds dead or you have an usb 1 1 cable and it should an usb 2 0 cable </s>

<s> i apologize for not being explicit in the beginning i thought the fact that the computer recognizes the drive as optical storage would be enough hoping that somebody else got the same problem </s>
<s> i hope it is just a cable problem </s>
<s> thank you for your help </s>
<s> the detail was needed since most windows would id such a drive as such </s>
<s> and i would see nothing wrong </s>
