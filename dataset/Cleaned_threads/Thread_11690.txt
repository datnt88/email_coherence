<s> this is what i have trendnet tew 452brp wireless router version b1 1r attached to optimum online modem service provider </s>
<s> i have a dell desktops wired router is attached to the dell desktop a dell laptop wired an acer netbook wireless all with xp </s>
<s> i also have an imac wired and a compaq laptop wireless w vista </s>
<s> all have no connection issues </s>
<s> what i want to do i just got a compaq dc7100sff desktop with xp and it has a wire connection for internet but i would like to use it downstairs with a wireless card </s>
<s> i called trendnet to ask what pci adapter to get for the tew 452brp router and they said to get the tew 423pi 54mbps wirelessg pci adapter </s>
<s> i went to neweggs website and they have it for 21 00 </s>
<s> but the reviews were not that good </s>
<s> so my question is should i get it or does anyone know of or could suggest a better adapter in the same price range </s>
<s> i dont know how important it is the have the adapter match the router or if it is even important at all </s>
<s> i use the wireless vista laptop in the same room i want to set up the desktop and have no connection issue with it even though it is the room farthest from the router </s>
<s> when i looked at the manual online for the dc7100sff it said there are 2 standard pci expansion slots 1 pci express x1 slot and 1 pci express x16 slot </s>
<s> have no idea what that means </s>
<s> assume i would be using the standard pci slot </s>
<s> any advice or help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> you re going to want to know which security method you will be using </s>
<s> it appears that today s thinking is that wpa2 is desired as the minimum </s>
<s> some of the bargain closeout devices seem to offer wpa but not wpa2 </s>
<s> you could also go usb as these are portable </s>
<s> there are mixed reviews as to whether a fixed card or usb device works best </s>
<s> i ve used both without serious issues </s>
<s> the trendnet router and adapter card both offer wpa2 and wpa </s>
<s> i am using wpa because i just couldn t get everything to work when i tried to set up wpa2 </s>
<s> i would however like to have that option with whatever wireless adapter i end up with </s>
<s> i am assuming that if the router i have is quot 54mbps quot i would have to get an adapter with the same mbps </s>
<s> a higher mbps would not have an advantage </s>
<s> or would i need to know what my service provider is </s>
