<s> hi i am getting different answers from different people </s>
<s> could anyone shine some light on me please </s>
<s> i am using a cable modem to connect to the internet and i need wired internet access for 2 pc s one vista and one xp </s>
<s> i don t have lan configured and i don t want the two pc s to be connected to each other </s>
<s> the tech from my isp told me that i just need a hub or switch but the rep at the computer store told me that i need a lan in order to use the switch so if i don t want a lan i should use a wired router instead </s>
<s> so do i need a router or a switch </s>
<s> also if i connect more than one pc s to the router or switch is the connection speed going to drop </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> you will have a lan unless you want to pay for a second cable modem </s>
<s> chaching </s>
<s> why not a router and be done </s>
<s> i would use a router </s>
<s> if you don t configure the 2 computers to talk to each other then they won t </s>
<s> use a router </s>
<s> i would go one step further and get a wireless </s>
<s> you can just disable the wireless side and not use it until needed </s>
<s> most router also give you extra security with nat and spi firewalls </s>
<s> your speed will not go down on the wired ports of the router but the wireless side will if you decide to use that </s>
<s> thanks for the suggestions </s>
<s> looks like the guy at the computer store is correct then i will go ahead and get a router </s>
<s> cheers </s>
