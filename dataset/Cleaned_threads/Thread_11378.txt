<s> i have 2 western digital external drives </s>
<s> the problem i am having is sometimes my photos will be gray half way down to the bottom </s>
<s> and they become unusable </s>
<s> the wierd thing is this </s>
<s> i recently purchased a slide program that i can see the whole photo but if i try to use it i only see a blank black space </s>
<s> but when i click on the photo again from within the program not putting it in a slide show what i see is 3 of the same photo one each on top of the other at different levels </s>
<s> i hope this is making sense </s>
<s> i am afraid to open my photos on the externals as it ruins them has anyone else had this problem or know what it might be that is causing this </s>
<s> it s unlikely a photo will be ruined by opening it in a viewer </s>
<s> reasonably speaking it isn t updated so stays unchanged </s>
<s> to ensure that set it to read only from windows explorer my computer or command prompt </s>
<s> that way it s safe to experiment with these weird problems both on your external drive and on internal drives </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> if you watch these forums you find some are thinking of these drives literally as quot storage quot they are storage but should never be thought of your archive or backup </s>
