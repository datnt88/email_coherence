<s> i have a new dvd writer that burns dual layer dvds with the proper disks </s>
<s> thing is will any other dvd drive read a dual layer disk burned on this drive as the ones on my other computers </s>
<s> or must it only be one of the new dual layer drives </s>
<s> thanks dan </s>
<s> many commercial dvds are already dual layer </s>
<s> but recordable dual layer while fine on most drives is expected not to work on many dvd players connected to tvs </s>
<s> widely discussed so i ll skimp on why </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> excellent </s>
<s> i m concerned with backing up primarily </s>
<s> i m a photograper and generate gigabytes of digital photo files </s>
<s> i have a separate mirror hard drive that i keep up to date but also like to do periodic incremental updates on disc </s>
<s> the most recent took 12 dvds so i thought the dual layer might be a more practical answer but it wouldn t work if regular dvd drives couldn t read the dual layer discs </s>
<s> thanks very much dan </s>
<s> seems to me that 12 dvds is less than 60 gb a lot of dvds but only equal to a small hard drive </s>
<s> if it was me i d get a very small hard drive a local electronics store recently had the western digital 200 gb hard drives on sale for 59 </s>
<s> then i d spend another 45 for a kit to convert the hard drive into an external usb drive </s>
<s> for about 100 you d get much more storage and could have all your files appear in windows explorer in a single view making files easier to see find </s>
<s> in addition this would sooner or later be cheaper than buying all those dvds which could only be used once </s>
<s> some of the external hard drive kits even have fire wire connections in addition to usb </s>
