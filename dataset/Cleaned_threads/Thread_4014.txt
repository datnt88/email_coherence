<s> hi all i picked up a new laptop and am trying to add it to my home wireless network </s>
<s> with much frustration </s>
<s> the network works fine it s a belkin 7320 4 router extended with an apple airport express </s>
<s> due to the airport and my lack of neighbors the network is unsecured </s>
<s> it s set up for dhcp and is running in b g mode </s>
<s> the following machines are working fine with this setup one xp home laptop with a broadcom integrated b g nic circa 2003 one xp home desktop with a belkin b g pci card circa 2005 one xp home desktop with a belkin b g pci card circa 2006 and has successfully allowed at least a dozen other mac and pc laptops to connect over the last two or so years it s been in place never an issue before </s>
<s> here s where it gets weird </s>
<s> the new notebook is a compaq presario v6000 notebook running xp pro and with a broadcom b g integrated wireless card </s>
<s> when i attempt to use this machine in my network strange things happen </s>
<s> at best the machine has difficulty connecting to the network either using dhcp or manually entering its ip info </s>
<s> it will show connected but only intermittently get to the internet and while other pcs in its workgroup can see the machine as a workgroup member they can t get to any of its shared folders </s>
<s> running ip config shows the wireless is getting an address from the router and it looks correct </s>
<s> if i run repair connection at this time i may or may not get an ip via dhcp though windows shows connected at 24mbps or better </s>
<s> stranger still the unit will knock other pcs off the network even though it s not trying to use a previously assigned ip address and it seems to be causing interference with the other machines on the network </s>
<s> as soon as i turn off the radio on the presario the network works as expected </s>
<s> i ve moved the notebook around to a few different locations and this doesn t seem to affect the problem </s>
<s> i ve tried a couple different things within the advanced section of the configuration panel of the broadcom turned off bluetooth collaboration turned off afterburner but this hasn t made a difference </s>
<s> stranger still if i try the machine on my work s network everything just seems to work fine so it appears to not be a defective card </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> also i assume your network is something like workgroup and all the machines have this in common </s>
<s> yes all have the same workgroup assigned and all machines have unique names </s>
<s> try to only enable 802 11g on the router and all computers labtops </s>
<s> if you have a mixed network the network throughput might be dropped to half or more if there are 802 11g and 802 11b wireless clients in the network </s>
<s> try to tune the wireless adapter settings on that compaq computer and see how it works </s>
<s> also the wireless bandwidth is shared among wireless clients the more clients you have the slower the network </s>
<s> hope this helps o picohat </s>
<s> thanks for the suggestions i tried changing the base station and repeater to g only but this made no difference to the performance of the laptop </s>
<s> i m beginning to think there s an incompatibility between my base station belkin f5d7230 4 revision a and my laptop s card a broadcom 4311 mini pci e card </s>
<s> same one as is used by dell under the name 1410 if memory serves </s>
<s> at this stage no communication takes place between the two devices </s>
<s> i cannot get an ip via dhcp and no activity occurs on the wlan light on the belkin when i try to repair connection via windows </s>
<s> the broadcom does see the belkin though at 5 bars 54mbps strength and a different machine using an older broadcom chip wirelessly is connected via dhcp and is screaming </s>
<s> should also add that the troubled machine has no issues whatsoever connecting via ethernet and is also fine wirelessly in another network </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> been a while thought i d post a followup i ve been using the laptop wired for a couple weeks with what i thought were no issues turns out i d just not been using it at the same time as my wife </s>
<s> it seems even with the radio switched off just having the laptop powered up was knocking her machine off the wireless network </s>
<s> to make matters more surreal i physically removed the wireless card from the machine just having it powered up knocks her off the network </s>
<s> to be fair the laptop is only a couple feet from the wireless ap and is probably causing some interference when i get a chance to try relocating things i ll give it another go </s>
<s> wanted to ask if anybody s seen this kind of behavior before </s>
<s> i know things like microwaves flourescent lights cordless phones can all mess with 802 11x traffic so i suppose a cpu could too if its chassis were poorly shielded and its clock were close to the 2 4ghz range </s>
<s> again this is a dual core amd machine running at a 1 6ghz clock speed </s>
<s> if you ve seen this kind of behavior before what did you do to resolve the issue </s>
<s> will also try changing channels on the router and repeater </s>
<s> i would focus on the router and extender as most probable cause </s>
<s> first ensure you have the latest router firmware </s>
<s> reset the router to factory default config and shut off the airport extender to see if problem still exists </s>
<s> you were right it s the laptop interfering with the router i had reset the router and updated firmware to no avail when i realized i didn t even need to have the wireless card in the unit to cause the problem interference as the source of the problem came clear </s>
<s> so and this hurts the easy fix i changed channels to 11 from 1 on the ap and extender and it solved the problem </s>
<s> looks like the combination of 1 6 ghz cpu clocking the lot of other clocking in the laptop generates hash into the 2 4ghz signal of the ap </s>
<s> moving the network signal moving higher into the spectrum took care of it </s>
<s> let s hope none of my neighbors go gung ho on channel 11 thanks to everybody </s>
