<s> thanks a lot for replying d d </s>
<s> just want to pipe in that i have given up with the small form factor sony s et </s>
<s> al </s>
<s> whether at home or traveling i cannot do without my dell latitude with 15 4 quot screen and resolution of 1920 x 1200 it is a bit heavy but well worth the added weight </s>
<s> i would consider other brands if i could get them to tell me what their resolution is and sell me a laptop with a high resolution monitor at a reasonable price </s>
<s> hmm all i have been hearing constantly for a year now is how dell isn t as good as other notebooks are </s>
<s> i dunno i guess it gave me a bias opinion towards them and now no matter what i always look the other way when i hear dell </s>
<s> s </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> these types of questions generally illicit tons of opinions that just cause further confusion for the buyer </s>
<s> as i write this i see an older toshiba sitting beside me a gateway in my travel bag and my daughter s new acer that she bought when she got her first job out of college </s>
<s> none of these computers have ever given me any issues or problems </s>
<s> all three have performed at or above their respective specifications and my own expectations </s>
<s> so what would you have me say </s>
<s> i would rate all of them a buy </s>
<s> what i would suggest is going to a store of your choice and test driving all of the systems </s>
<s> compare them and then make a decision based on your results and reviews </s>
<s> i just finished helping a neighbor purchase a new notebook and after everything was done they bought a new hp laptop </s>
<s> i think they made a great choice based on their criteria not mine </s>
<s> that is what s important </s>
<s> one more thing regardless of what you buy once you have don t second guess yourself based on information you didn t have originally </s>
<s> make the best choice available and then move on and enjoy the new system </s>
<s> good luck and let us know what you eventually get </s>
<s> hey thanx a lot for the response </s>
<s> my biggest problem with this acer notebook is that i can not find a single review of that model for the life of me </s>
<s> am i gonna be the only one in the world who purchased it </s>
<s> it kinda scares me lol </s>
<s> well you won t be the only one that is exactly the one my daughter bought at compusa in late august </s>
<s> she went for all the bells and whistles and so far has been very pleased with the performance </s>
<s> i doubt she will ever quot review quot it as being a full time 6th grade teacher she doesn t spend much time doing that type of thing </s>
<s> i won t review it as i don t spend enough time on it to do a proper job of reviewing it and that wouldn t be fair to the people reading the review looking for an opinion </s>
<s> i will say this out of the seven computers in the house it is by far the fastest one of the bunch </s>
<s> it smokes thru spyware and anti virus checks that i do for her every month </s>
<s> other than that i would prefer not to comment further </s>
<s> again good luck with your search </s>
<s> hey thanks a lot for the comments everyone </s>
<s> i have bought the acer 5112 which i was looking at for a long time </s>
<s> its a great computer for me its incredible </s>
<s> it runs new games on high speed the one i tried was oblivion very well </s>
<s> the battery life isnt the greatest but thats cuz its a powerful notebook </s>
<s> if you have any questions or if you wanna buy this laptop and cant find any reviews anywhere arrrr then you can ask me and i shall answer again thanx a lot </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> congratulations </s>
<s> enjoy your new computer you obviously did your homework and now it is time to reap the benefits </s>
<s> the notebook i own is old but it still has better specs intel 2 00ghz 768ram 80gb hd </s>
<s> how is 768 ram better then 2 gigs of ddr2 </s>
<s> yes your intel has 2 0 ghz but mine has 2 processors and they are amd so an amd 1 6 ghz processor is better then a 2 0 ghz intel </s>
<s> just cuz amd processors are measured differently </s>
<s> oh and im sure my graphic cards can kick your comps ass </s>
