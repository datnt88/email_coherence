<s> the internal sound on my g4 sawtooth is inadequate in fact almost inaudible now </s>
<s> i have a couple of little aiwa speakers that my daughter left behind when she went into the wide world and they can plug into the computer but they don t always work very well and i was thinking of getting some new ones </s>
<s> my needs are modest i want to be able to hear the sound on videos and the rest of normal computer sounds such as voices </s>
<s> it would be lovely to listen to music but since i have a nice couple of speakers on my stereo and no ipod and i haven t yet listened to music on the computer i think that something pretty basic in the speaker line would do for me </s>
<s> i am very willing to try to find such speakers myself but i tried the peripherals forum and it all seemed to be about pcs also cnet s speaker reviews and found only one that explicitly said it was mac compatible </s>
<s> can someone either recommend speakers to me or lead me to the terms i need to use to search the reviews and the peripherals forum </s>
<s> i seem not to have hit on the right way to search for the speakers that would suit my purposes and my ancient computer </s>
<s> i don t want junk but don t need the very best either </s>
<s> i had been hoping to catch the sales on computer equipment happening at a few stores tomorrow monday but i m sure it s more important to me to do some research and get what will work well than to rush into the purchase </s>
<s> thanks for any tips jenny </s>
<s> as your stated requirements are basic pop along to your local radio shack and pick up a pair of powered speakers </s>
<s> the speaker outlet on the g4 is a standard size 3 5mm i think so you will have no problem finding a pair </s>
<s> try to avoid any that are powered by the usb port as this not only ties up a port that you could otherwise use but also draws power away from any other usb devices you have connected </s>
<s> a reasonable pair should not cost you more that 20 p </s>
<s> thanks for the useful recommendation </s>
<s> j r had a three speaker pairs in that range and a bit higher for their cyber monday sale that sounded promising harmon multimedia jbl duet altec lansing v52420 and logitech 980 000023 s 220 but i couldn t determine from the descriptions or from reviews of them from cnet whether they fulfilled the specs you mentioned </s>
<s> i m just not familiar with the terms as described so though at least two of those brought enthusiastic reviews overall i think i ought to follow your guidance </s>
<s> getting something that didn t work would be a real pain and as you say my needs are simple hearing what the computer is transmitting watching a movie perhaps or listening to some music but not requiring anything super in the transmission </s>
<s> i can always use my stereo if i want to satisfy my urge for high quality sound </s>
<s> i m not even sure that my computer is up to producing anything worthy of more expensive speakers or those with more pleasing sound </s>
<s> so when i get a chance i shall trot off to radio shack there s one near me and get a pair of the speakers </s>
<s> thanks again so much </s>
<s> jenny </s>
<s> more confusion </s>
<s> if all you want is something to hear sound with and are not really worried about the acoustic quality of the sound you hear the a cheap set of speakers will do </s>
<s> still powered ones though </s>
<s> there are speakers out there that do not require any power but the audio output of your mac does not have enough ooomph to make them work </s>
<s> the sound it produces requires amplification before it is strong enough to hear and for this the speakers need power </s>
<s> the jbl speakers are 120v powered as are the logitech ones </s>
<s> i didn t find any information on the altec lansing v52420 and i now know that is because it is actually a vs2420 </s>
<s> tsk tsk this one will be good too as it is also 120v powered </s>
<s> so whichever one you fancy from j r will be good for your machine </s>
<s> of course you can still check out radio shack </s>
<s> let us know what you decide p </s>
<s> dear p it s on me not you but frankly i didn t anticipate a reply </s>
<s> thanks for this one it s food for thought though i probably shall get the radio shack ones after all </s>
<s> oddly enough the computer s own sound has increased who knows why although i still think i d get more out of external speakers and even modest ones </s>
<s> many thanks again </s>
<s> i ll surely let you know what happens </s>
<s> jenny </s>
<s> sorry for the long delay on this </s>
<s> i hope that you all haven t been holding your collective breath awaiting my answer about which speakers i got </s>
<s> i considered all the speakers i mentioned plus a three part set at j r and ended up the with harman jbl ones </s>
<s> they re a little funny looking but they are compact and have lovely sound and had the virtue of being on sale for 15 less than the usual price </s>
<s> i am pleased with them </s>
<s> i do wish there were some way to turn off their lights without taking the plug out </s>
<s> usually i don t bother but with the cable modem the router and the speakers all on and the other two of them blinking lights constantly i feel like an energy waster on a big scale </s>
<s> my environmental bona fides is at a new low </s>
<s> multiplied by all the others who are doings as i am doing it s a lot of energy use </s>
<s> but the cable guy told me never to turn off the modem and i ve no idea what turning off or unplugging the router would do so i go on a bit shamefacedly letting them all glow or blink without hindrance </s>
<s> lt sigh gt thank you for the guidance p the radio shack speakers were just fine but i found the harman jbl sound mellower and though that wasn t what i started out looking for it caught me unawares </s>
<s> i listened to a schubert string quintet the other day and was surprised by how pleased i was being able to listen and work in the same room </s>
<s> i hope that everyone s new year will play out happily and successfully </s>
<s> jenny </s>
<s> glad your listening desires are being sated peter </s>
