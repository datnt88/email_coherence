<s> i have 2 hard drives one of which is thw boot drive </s>
<s> is it possible to make the other one the boot drive </s>
<s> if so you should be able to switch between drives through the bios </s>
<s> but by default most will look for the master drive on the first ide channel </s>
<s> so you can also change drive jumpers to accomplish this or if using cable select switch positions on the ide cable </s>
<s> since you did not mention anything about hardware i am presuming you are using ide hds </s>
<s> if you are using sata drives bios or cable selection is still how it s done </s>
<s> open up the computer and make de master as slave and the second make it master </s>
