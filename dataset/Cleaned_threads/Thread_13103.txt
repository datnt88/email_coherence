<s> i am running about 8 computers in my home business and my web guy tells me that he can t make my combination of macs and pcs quot work together quot the current method of printing is to email him all documents so he can send them to the printer </s>
<s> he s also telling me he can t create multiple email accounts so all the business emails come into one account which he then reads and passes along </s>
<s> now i am no genius when it comes to computers but i possess a basic understanding </s>
<s> can t i just use a wired router and create a network </s>
<s> i realize there may be potential issues with sata vs usb ports on the printers as one is older so worst case scenario would be two separate networks right </s>
<s> it s like telling me i can t use a mac at a wifi hotspot </s>
<s> your wifi router is the same technology as what your hotspot uses </s>
<s> gt there are issues with some oses as you go past 5 machines </s>
<s> xp has connection limits so a shared printer or files will only allow the first 5 machines </s>
<s> read which notes the xp pro and windows 2000 professional limit </s>
<s> no need to create 2 networks </s>
<s> show them your working network later </s>
