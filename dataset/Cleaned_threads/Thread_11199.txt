<s> ok so i have a dell latitude d505 laptop that i received for free </s>
<s> i came with a fujitsu 60g ata 100 hard drive which i quickly filled up to capacity </s>
<s> i purchased a new western digital 160g drive from newegg which is ata 6 </s>
<s> i used a hard drive clone device to copy my smaller drive and then pulled out the old caddy and replaced the drive </s>
<s> upon start up i received an error message that the new drive was no bootable </s>
<s> is this due to the difference between ata 6 and ata 100 </s>
<s> thats the only discernable difference </s>
<s> the new drive has 40 pins and the old drive has like a bar type connection </s>
<s> if that is the case is there anything i can do to use the ata 6 drive or am i screwed </s>
<s> hey i figured it out </s>
<s> no need to respond </s>
<s> of helping others </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
