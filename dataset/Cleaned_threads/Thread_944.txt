<s> i have just bought an external usb hard drive case that enables me to add in any ide hard drive </s>
<s> whenever i put in my 40gb maxtor hard drive it gets recognised instantly on my windows xp service pack 2 system </s>
<s> however when i swap the drive to my ibm 120gb hard drive it does not even get shown in device manager </s>
<s> i put the ibm drive in another system but attached directly to the internal ide cable and the drive works fine </s>
<s> i then reformatted the ibm drive but it is still not recognised when i place it back into the usb case and attach it to my system </s>
<s> i did try changing around the drive jumpers but nothing seems to work </s>
<s> does anyone have any ideas </s>
<s> the only cases i see have all but one setting </s>
<s> it s cable select </s>
<s> if your documention states otherwise that would be a first or some very old unit </s>
<s> the drive may not show in explorer </s>
<s> try the disk management tool start help support if you can t find it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the jumpers i were referring to were the ones on the hard drive itself </s>
<s> but whatever setting i think they are ignored </s>
<s> i can set the jumpers on my maxtor drive to master slave or cable select and it is always recognised </s>
<s> i have tried the ibm drive on more than one computer within the usb case and it never gets recognised </s>
<s> i can now only guess </s>
<s> i wonder if its a capacity problem incompatibility or some other obscure reason </s>
<s> for instance the drive management tool </s>
<s> stick with cable select </s>
<s> it s too bad you didn t supply the make and model of the case </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> apologies as i tried to post full details previously but closed my browser down too quickly </s>
<s> case is as in the link below when i look under computer management then device manager and disk drives the ibm drive does not appear there </s>
<s> however swapping over for the maxtor drive and it appears under device manager ok </s>
<s> 1 the cable type appears to be 80 conductor ide in the drive case </s>
<s> that means to stick to cable select </s>
<s> 2 you didn t look in the disk management you can find with start help and support </s>
<s> it s fine you looked in the device manager but do try the other </s>
<s> it could be an older design case that didn t support that drive or the drive just doesn t work in that case </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes i did look in disk management it was one of the first things i checked but it does not appear there </s>
<s> i phoned the tech support place this afternoon from where i purchased this product and the guy at the other said end seemed to think that my drive is not supported by the usb controller in external usb device </s>
<s> now if i had bought a car that was not able to drive on fast roads </s>
