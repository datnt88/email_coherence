<s> alright so i tried installing a new sound card on my custom built machine </s>
<s> when i went to turn it on and install the new drivers when it wouldn t boot </s>
<s> nothing </s>
<s> i hit the power and the led lights come on fans kick in but no video signal is sent and the monitor just goes into stand by </s>
<s> what could be my problem here </s>
<s> i am thinking mobo but hoping maybe just the ram </s>
<s> how to i check before buying all new </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> spooky or what </s>
<s> i turned my machine on this morning and have exactly the same problems </s>
<s> power supply fan and cpu fan both start again no beeps from the memory monitor led doesn t change from amber to green </s>
<s> tried pressing reset button but nothing happens pressed power button again nothing only way to turn off is to disconnect from mains power supply </s>
<s> wondered if there may have ben a power surge overnight </s>
<s> anybody got any ideas </s>
<s> otherwise it s going to be case of swapping each componant into another machine one at a time to find the fault </s>
<s> regards mike </s>
<s> hi mediafreakgodicon since reading your post and posting my first reply i have spoken to my mate who suggested a way to solve my problem and it has worked so i thought you may want to try it </s>
<s> look on your mobo for the jumper to clear your cmos and short it out </s>
<s> if there isn t a jumper to short remove the battery for a short time whilst disconnected from the mains </s>
<s> this will restore cmos to default settings </s>
<s> it has worked for me so give it a try </s>
<s> regards mike </s>
<s> hey mike i tried that out today but it didn t work as well for me as it did you in fact it didn t work at all </s>
<s> i pulled out the lithium battery to clear the cmos </s>
<s> when i put it back in and restarted my pc i was still in the same boat as where i started </s>
<s> any other ideas </s>
<s> i m about ready to just give it up </s>
<s> sound card </s>
<s> i always unplug my pc before i ever open the case </s>
<s> i had more or less the same problem yesterday </s>
<s> computer froze i rebooted and nothing </s>
<s> the power comes on the hard drive light is on constantly the cd rom light comes on briefly and then that s it </s>
<s> i tried clearing the cmos but no joy i don t care about tha data it s my kids pc but i don t want to throw it away </s>
<s> bit of a bugger really richard </s>
