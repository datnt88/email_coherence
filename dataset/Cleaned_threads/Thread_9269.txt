<s> ok long story short my employer downsized and moved their office into their basement to save costs </s>
<s> i moved their network from the office to basement </s>
<s> i made not ip changes or config changes to server </s>
<s> only difference is the dsl line that the network will share has a dynamic ip going into the netopia modem router and not a static ip as before </s>
<s> will this work </s>
<s> also a linksys wireless router is connected to the netopia to provide wireless access in the house </s>

<s> the servers are on a 192 168 200 </s>
<s> the netopia is giving me a 192 168 2 </s>
<s> and has dhcp server on and the linkys a 192 168 1 </s>
<s> i got so frustrated that i bought a wireless nic for the workstations which already had wired nics setup to access the existing network and working just fine and tried to connect the wireless nic to the wireless network </s>
<s> that worked temp but how can i plug in manual ip etc on a dynamic dsl network </s>
<s> help i m so confused and really want to learn what i am doing wrong </s>
<s> i m looking for the most cost effective and easiest route for this today </s>
<s> thank you so much </s>
<s> i should add that the netopia has dhcp server turned on should this be acting as quot relay agent quot </s>
<s> are there some settings in the netopia or the linksys that i should change </s>
<s> why not try it our way </s>
