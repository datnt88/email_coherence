<s> i have and old dell laptop i would like to clear it and use it as an external hard drive </s>
<s> how would i do that </s>
<s> i have windows xp on both laptop and desk top </s>

<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the laptop itself i would like to leave it conected in my network and just be able to access files from it </s>
<s> the probelm is it runs windows xp and takes alot of the laptops memory </s>
<s> can i clear it and use it as storage </s>
<s> how would i do that </s>
<s> here you already have it setup to access and basically got storage present </s>
<s> if you don t like xp because it seems a resource hog then find some linux os you can live with and use that as storage </s>
<s> you problem isn t storage as your 1st </s>
<s> posed but rather with xp </s>
<s> you probably could be better served using some ext </s>
<s> usb case with hd and just deal with it as an extension of your current main system rather than a network </s>
<s> using a nas purchase setup would be more open to a network storage and any system that has access to it </s>
<s> the last option would be to keep your laptop xp os and add replace with a larger hd to increase storage itself </s>
