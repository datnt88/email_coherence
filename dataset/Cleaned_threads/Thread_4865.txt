<s> i just bought a factory repaired seagate barracuda 750 gig sata drive and installed it </s>
<s> when i rebooted the mobo started to beep and the drive made similar sound or noise </s>
<s> both sounds continue with drive data cable unplugged from board and drive </s>
<s> after about 2 mins </s>
<s> both sounds cease </s>
<s> bios does not detect it </s>
<s> the drive spins up and otherwise sounds normal </s>
<s> my rig is as follows ecs 865g m8 motherboard celeron d 3 2 ghz processor seagate st3750640as 750gb 7200rpm 16mb sata 300 hdd austin dr b300atx 300 watt max power supply someone pleeeease help me </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> since you do not give details on this what was the status of your system before this </s>
<s> was this a working system </s>
<s> if so take out the seagate drive and put the other drive back in </s>
<s> if all ok bad drive </s>
<s> if this is not the case and the system never was started before try a different drive or try the drive in question in another system </s>
<s> while i have not used a drive of that size from the specs it does not use any more power than smaller drives and should not overwhelm the power supply </s>
<s> see here </s>
<s> just unplug the hd completely not the data alone </s>
<s> if the sound continues you have another problem source at least </s>
<s> offhand it sounds like a bad fan </s>
<s> there are fans in the psu and check all others when starting </s>
<s> if you haven t already clean out the dust bunnies and the fans as well </s>
<s> depending on your wallet if the psu fan s are the source of noise you maybe better off replacing the psu as damage from lack of cooling maybe already present and thus your result </s>
<s> of course any other fan failure not turning or not 100 will cause problems too </s>
<s> if fan replace will similar unit </s>
<s> if psu replace with higher wattage unit cost for similar type above 300w is easily affordable imho for generic psu </s>
<s> follow your ear for noise source open case however don t unplug fans to test observe </s>
<s> verify under the bios area that the hd segment has been enabled for new hd plus be sure master slave jumper or cs cabling is proper </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> try this drive in another machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry for missing info i m new to this whole forum approach however i ve been building for a while now </s>
<s> you know how it goes new config and never encountered this before </s>
<s> everything was running great </s>
<s> all my fans volts and rpms great nothing even close to too hot no dust build up </s>
<s> everything was running and performing fine </s>
<s> i suspected the hdd from the start just trying other things to keep from the hassle of sending back and the whole go round of it all </s>
<s> that s a fairly new jumbo size drive </s>
<s> we ve seen issues over the years as some bios will not play with newer drives </s>
<s> while covers most issues you are on the leading edge so that and the not so big power supply becomes suspect </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this just started last night and i m waiting for some ppl to get home that have sata plugs on their mb s and are willing to let me try this on their machines </s>
<s> these ppl live in the country and i live in back woods boondocks so this takes a while </s>
<s> thanx for the tip i ll post results hopefully late tonight </s>
<s> thank you so very much for the help </s>
<s> we seem to be thinking along the same wavelength </s>
<s> i was thinking that trying the drive in my friends machine will answer that q too </s>
<s> i am not sure of his psu size but with his rig set up i know he has to have no less than 450 raid 4 big nvidia sli cards so on so forth </s>
<s> thankx again </s>
<s> since you have a sata hd be sure you have a good seat on the sata cable </s>
<s> older mtrbds </s>
<s> did an issue on this matter </s>
<s> newer sata cables are better seating and or lock in better </s>
<s> even so just check it as some builders even silicone them into place </s>
<s> as for 750gb hd is a tad large if your mtrbd </s>
<s> needs any bios updates see what they re for it may address such issues </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> turn on or enable the sata controller in the mb bios </s>
<s> were the sata drivers loaded for the motherboard </s>
<s> what os and sp are you running </s>
<s> sure the bios is up to date and will handle large drive s </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> hi i m about to flash and update my bios </s>
<s> my main issue and concern is the beeping from the mb when the hd is plugged into just the psu with data cable unattached to either hardware item </s>
<s> this is what is making me call my psu into question </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
