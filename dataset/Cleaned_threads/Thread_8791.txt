<s> hello i just removed a very full internal hard drive seagate ide and replaced it with a new 160gb western digital hard drive </s>
<s> i thought it would be a simple swap just needing to change jumpers as i was slaving the old drive </s>
<s> however none of the drives are booting up i am getting a clicking sound from both drives </s>
<s> what went wrong we simply unplugged and followed the directions that came with the new drive </s>
<s> windows xp o s </s>
<s> 1 these computers have the os installed to those hard drives and a new drive would do nothing </s>
<s> your post does not reveal how you prepared the hdd for booting </s>
<s> 2 the car analogy </s>
<s> some folk think you can change a hdd like you do a car tire </s>
<s> sorry no </s>
<s> it s much more complicated </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> disconnect he new one visit the seagate com site and get the diagrams so you can set the new one to a slave </s>
<s> also download the seagate utility to clone drives then set the new one as master the oldie as slave and reboot from the seagate utlity cd dvd usb </s>
<s> wd has a slightly different way to jumper their hd s than other makers </s>
<s> look close at the paper work or visit their site </s>
<s> if you have 80 cond cables you might want to try the cs jumper and the proper plug on the cable </s>
