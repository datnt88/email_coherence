<s> in my motherboard manual it says pc1600 ddr ram but my local computer store only sells pc133 ddr ram or pc 400 ddr think that is right ram </s>
<s> motherboard in question is an msi kt2 combo </s>
<s> has 2 ddr and 2 sd ram slots </s>
<s> they constantly say they can t supply pc1600 ram and i am wondering what the actual differences are </s>
<s> i was wondering if it is really worth the effort to hunt down the exact type of memory listed in my user manual </s>
<s> the specifications for your motherboard indicate the following memory is compatible two modules of pc1600 or pc2100 ddr sdram 184 pins or two modules of pc100 or pc133 sdram 168 pins ddr sdram ddr for short is a different type of memory than simple sdram ddr memory slowest lt pc1600 lt pc2100 lt pc2700 lt pc3200 lt fastest the fastest ram that your motherboard can support is pc2100 ram </s>
<s> however since memory makers have decided that it isn t profitable to make the slower and older pc1600 and pc2100 ram anymore you will have a difficult time finding it in stock </s>
<s> no need to worry because ddr ram is backwards compatible and you could use pc2700 or possibly pc3200 modules in a board that calls for pc2100 </s>
<s> reference for windows xp get that computer up to 512mb or 1gb or memory </s>
<s> ram is referred to by 2 different means ie pc2700 333 mhz or ddr333 you d be best to go to and use the on line scan to determine your needs </s>
<s> spend some time on that site to get an underatnding of ram designations </s>
<s> a google never hurt either </s>
<s> and yes it does matter you need the excact ram </s>
<s> and no i never heard of a motherboard that will support both sdram ddr ram sdram is for older machines like 5yrs older </s>
<s> board that supports 2 types of ram </s>
<s> didn t do my homework it s sunday night </s>
<s> i purchased what was affordable at the time and now have 512 mb of pc400 ddr ram </s>
<s> my motherboard has 2 ddr sockets and 2 sd sockets so you can use one or the other but not both </s>
<s> also i built this machine from the board up so i know a lot more then the casual user </s>
<s> and it s been fun because i am always pottering around with it and upgrading things here and there </s>
