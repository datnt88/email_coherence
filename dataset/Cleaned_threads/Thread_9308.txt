<s> i removed and refilled the black ink cartridge on my 880 and and could not get it to print </s>
<s> multiable cleanings would not improve quality of color so i removed it also and filled all the head wells with head cleaning fluid </s>
<s> read this was very effective on episons now black or color will not print </s>
<s> is this one of the episons that has a chip to stop reuse of cartridges </s>
<s> jand </s>
<s> if this is the first time refill and it doesn t work then you may have the chipped ink cartridge </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> after removal neither black which printed well or color poor quality would work </s>
<s> it s a second hand printer but worked when i got it </s>
<s> send a note to the guy at atlascopy com he knows a lot fj </s>
<s> oops meant to say would not work sorry </s>
<s> you don t want to know i tossed out an epson c80 last week </s>
<s> i think someone carted it off and they won t write a similar post </s>
<s> nothing tells me that your printer actually works </s>
<s> on the downside i had to buy a full set of new ink to see if the printer had failed </s>
<s> of course it had failed </s>
<s> so smarting from that failure i bought a new printer and am back in business </s>
<s> to remove part of the stinging feeling i lucked out and found another c80 owner and shipped him the full set of inks then tossed out the old printer </s>
<s> you have to grapple with these printers since the costs are now so low that a full set of inks is close to what the new printer is bob </s>
<s> seems i ve not been clear last night </s>
<s> printer worked when i got it except red ink had lines </s>
<s> cleaning heads with head cleaning did not improve this </s>
<s> after using printer for a while the black ink indicator said to replace it </s>
<s> i refilled the black and it would not work after multiable cleanings </s>
<s> decided to remove both and use head cleaner in wells </s>
<s> then neither cartridge would work </s>
<s> that s why i wondered if this epson was one that had the chips to prevent the use of cartiadges once they were removed </s>
<s> trying to figure out if i need a chip or a printer </s>
<s> sorry for the confusion </s>
<s> jand </s>
<s> sadly if cleaning doesn t clear that up you have to try some dozen times then you have to decide if its worth it for a new printhead </s>
<s> the quot chip quot on the inkcarts was visible on all the epson models i ve seen </s>
<s> it s a little green blue circuit board </s>
<s> refilling might be possible but i never have </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for your patience </s>
<s> did 8 10 cleanings with no results </s>
<s> have some destructions for dismanteling and cleaning this printer </s>
<s> guess i have nothing to loose at this point </s>
<s> jand </s>
