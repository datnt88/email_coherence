<s> i recently purchased a yamaha cavit dp u50 personal sound receiver for the pc </s>
<s> i also purchased the yamaha ns u50 speakers as well </s>
<s> how do i get these speakers to work with this receiver and did i buy the wrong speakers </s>
<s> the receiver has rca plugs but the speaker are the normal quot bare wire quot connections </s>
<s> i am getting no sound from this setup </s>
<s> please anyone help </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> amplifier capable of driving the speakers </s>
<s> or does it expect you to use powered speakers which have an audio amplifier built into them </s>
<s> i ll do a search and see if i can learn more </s>
<s> as for the two wires you can simply snip the rca connector off and use the wires </s>
<s> the shield may be the return for both speakers </s>
<s> comes with two sound powered speakers </s>
<s> why did you buy separate speakers </s>
<s> or did you simoply buy the card </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it says downside no amplifier </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i purchased each separately </s>
<s> the receiver was sold alone and i thought i had purchased the correct speakers </s>
<s> i guess i didnt </s>
<s> i tried snipping off a pair of rca jacks with speaker wire but the sound is way too low </s>
<s> have i missed something here or do you think i should purchase other speakers </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ray thank you for taking the time to look at this </s>
<s> i guess i should have researched this better before i purchased it </s>
<s> ebay purchase </s>
<s> speakers because the unit does not have an amplifier built in the first link that i went to 190 or so said that it came with powered speakers then saw on other links that you could get it much cheaper without speakers </s>
<s> didn t know that you bought it through ebay </s>
<s> i ve never even looked there for anything </s>
<s> i figure if i got burned once i would never save enough to make up for it on another purchase </s>
<s> you can get a cheap pair of powered speakers at wal mart for 15 00 </s>
<s> with a so called quot woofer quot for 25 00 </s>
<s> hope that things turn out ok now that you know the solution </s>
<s> yeah dp u50 is a processor only no amp </s>
<s> the rp 100 has the built in 30 watt per ch </s>
<s> amp a tuner still only 2 channels virtual dolby 5 1 </s>
<s> you can find one for 99 nice price </s>
<s> also if i m not mistaken you can check out the rp u200 5 channel discrete a remote </s>
<s> i picked up a pair of the ns u50 s for 17 99 new last week </s>
<s> they re o k with a sub but my polk r15 s sound much better </s>
<s> i m using the rp 100 mostly in straight stereo </s>
<s> i got it to use with my g4 cube which only has usb sound interface does everything i need more for not a lot more than a pair of those tinny mac pro speakers </s>
<s> good luck </s>
