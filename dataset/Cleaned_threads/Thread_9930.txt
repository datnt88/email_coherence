<s> i am having problems with dust in my computer </s>
<s> i have my computer on for several hours a day and i think that it is overheating and when i took the case of my pc i discovered that there was a lot of dust inside especially on the fans </s>
<s> does anybody know what i can do about the dust or if there are any solutions </s>
<s> if you do please let me know </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> blow out all case filters fans heatsinks and other components with a can of compressed air </s>
<s> add case filters to air intake vents </s>
<s> purchase them or fabricate them out of any fine mesh nylon stocking scotchbrite pad piece of household air filter etc </s>
<s> as another poster offered you can use some type of filter arrangement </s>
<s> just beware that you have to maintain those filters and clean them because if those get clogged up they will be worse than just a dusted fan or so you cut off the airflow supply </s>
<s> if your system is on the floor or close to it elevate it at least 6in </s>
<s> or place on stand small table etc </s>
<s> to reduce dust pick up </s>
<s> if you have pets try to reduce thier dander or understand that can attribute to the dust problem </s>
<s> you wil always have some dust and thus be prepared to maintain at quot your cleaning periods quot what s best for you </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
