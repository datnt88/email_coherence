<s> ok i just opened my pc case to clean the dirt and so on when put back together and turned on right away it says quot monitor out of range quot with a pure black screen and pressing keyboard buttons or restarting the comp doesnt help </s>
<s> i tried putting my brothers monitor considering my monitor might be dead but still same error on screen is something wrong with my motherboard </s>
<s> how do i fix it please help </s>
<s> all help appreciated </s>
<s> it s possible you dislodged the video card unless yours in on the mb </s>
<s> agp slots can be touchy and component fit is not always perfect </s>
<s> video cards get unseated and it only takes small movement to do this </s>
<s> remove and reseat it and see if this helps </s>
