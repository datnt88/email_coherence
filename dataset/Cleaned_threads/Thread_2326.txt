<s> i just had verizon come in and set up my wireless network at home </s>
<s> i m running two laptops on it and would like to run my printer through the router </s>
<s> the printer is hooked up and the router recognizes that something is plugged into the ethernet port but the ping test always fails </s>
<s> i ve tried adding the printer as a standard tc ip setting but the computer can t find the printer i suppose because it s not communicating with the router properly </s>
<s> printer hp laserjet 2840 laptop windows vista any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> networking this printer would be a great help </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> have you set your printer s ip to be in the same range as your network ips </s>
<s> does the printer s subnet mask match your network s mask </s>
<s> usually these are set from the printer s front panel but you ll need to refer to the manual for actual adjustment </s>
<s> thanks sunwatcher i set the printer s ip subnet mask to the one s assigned by the router but still can t get the printer to ping </s>
