<s> i d love to get some thoughts on these components </s>

<s> this will be for gaming and general purpose web browsing ms office etc </s>
<s> i do have one specific question is my ram matched up well with my cpu </s>
<s> or will the ram speed be a major bottle neck </s>
<s> all other suggestions are appreciated </s>
<s> save yourself a few bucks and get a gigabyte ga p35 ds3l 90 instead of the ep35c </s>
<s> the ep35c supports both ddr2 and ddr3 but only 4gb with ddr3 rather than 8gb with ddr2 </s>
<s> and its performance with ddr3 is slower than ddr2 </s>
<s> so it s not buying you anything </s>
<s> the p35 ds3l is a bit faster </s>
<s> if you must have matrixraid get msi s p35 neo2 fr 110 </s>
<s> ultra s power supplies get very mixed reviews some are good some are crap </s>
<s> check out jonnyguru com hardocp com and anandtech com </s>
<s> make sure that specific model has good marks or go with a better brand </s>
<s> antec tru power trio 650w coolermaster s extremepower 650w corsair s 650w ocz s gamexstream 700w are all about 90 after rebates </s>
<s> ocz s 600w is one of the best power supplies for the money 69 after rebate if you re willing to spend the money saved on the gigabyte mobo just get a 8800gts 512 </s>
<s> as for ram you could go for faster cl4 but it won t make hardly any difference </s>
<s> likewise ddr2 1066 is faster but only noticeable in benchmarks </s>
<s> i d pop 4gb in just since it s so cheap now and you won t have to crack the case open anytime soon </s>
<s> i would go for the core2duo e8500 </s>
<s> it s the newest e processor and is 50 more for a 2 ghz boost </s>
<s> might as well splurge on it because it s only 50 bucks more for the latest and greatest </s>
<s> only 5 3 faster but 37 5 more expensive </s>
<s> is there a chance this ram won t work with the motherboard you recommended </s>
<s> this wasn t something i considered </s>
<s> then check the efficiency of that power supply </s>
<s> a more efficient power supply will use less energy </s>
<s> think 70 </s>
<s> the weight of it is also important </s>
<s> more weight the better the psu </s>
<s> this is due to the the number of windings in the transformer </s>
<s> power supplies are transformers they convert ac current to dc current </s>
<s> windings defined this thread untracked </s>
<s> thanks i went with ocz s 600w psu </s>
<s> 80 efficiency and higher in some cases according the tests i looked at </s>
<s> the gigabyte or msi motherboards </s>
<s> i ended up going with this i had read it s better to go with 2 2gb sticks </s>
<s> those sticks are way overpriced </s>
<s> for that price you could get ddr2 1066 with the same 5 5 5 18 timings here s another ddr2 800 2x2gb kit with the same timings for 81 tighter 4 4 4 12 timings are only a few bucks more p s </s>
<s> 4x1gb is fine if you run at stock speeds and you don t seem to be interested in overclocking </s>
<s> are those timings going to amount to a hill of beans while playing games </s>
<s> so why spend more than 80 </s>
<s> it actually comes out about the same </s>
<s> the rebate on the the ram originally listed was good on only one of the sets </s>
<s> so i wasn t getting both sets for 30 for a total of 60 also the ram i m getting is listed for more than i what i paid for it </s>
<s> i think an offer expired </s>
<s> either way it was going to be 120 </s>
<s> also a big factor in switching was that the corsair message boards were saying the mobo i got didn t do well with all the slots filled up with the ram i originally listed </s>
