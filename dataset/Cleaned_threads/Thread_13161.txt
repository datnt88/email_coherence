<s> i have a 500 gb maxtor onetouch 4 usb desktop drive that i use for archival stuff formatted into a 400 gib hfs and a 64 gb fat partition </s>
<s> except when i was upgrading my hd and upgrading to snow leopard i used it as a temporary time machine drive in case of drive failure during the transfer process </s>
<s> all of a sudden i get this message quot mac os x can t repair the disk quot maxtor 400 gb quot you can still open or copy files on the disk but you can t save changes to files on the disk </s>
<s> back up the disk and reformat it as soon as you can quot the fat partition appears to be fine </s>
<s> so my questions are what may have caused this and how stable can i expect the drive to be in the near future </s>
<s> i ve already started transferring data off the drive but i was really hoping to wait until black friday to get a new drive </s>
<s> will information on the damaged partition be quot safe quot for the time being </s>
<s> equally interesting to me is what could have caused this </s>
<s> i haven t run time machine backups to the drive for at least a week and have done no other major file operations besides reading movie files </s>
<s> the drive isn t making any sounds that would indicate drive failure and it seems to read just fine was this just the result of a random software glitch that corrupted the data structure somehow </s>
<s> interestingly i was checking the size of various folders and i noticed that the backups backupdb folder which should be around 65 gb last i checked reported as taking up over 230 gb of space when i started the backups a few weeks ago there was only 80 gb of space to begin with </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> buy your new one on black friday move all the data onto the new one reformat the old one </s>
<s> the warning did not have any specific time frame </s>
<s> the drive could be kaput even as i type this </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> sounds like a plan i ll just backup the stuff i really don t want to lose and cross my fingers </s>
<s> what do you think can cause something like this </s>
<s> just a random software error corrupted something </s>
<s> or do you think the drive itself may be suspect </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if it reformats nicely it may well be fine but i would be wary of it in the future </s>
