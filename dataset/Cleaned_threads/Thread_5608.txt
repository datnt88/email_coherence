<s> hey everyone im about to build a new pc and i d like some advice on what parts i should be buying my budget is about 1900 2200 thanks yp </s>
<s> almost forgot im thinking about playing games like crysis cod4 supreme commander coh yp </s>
<s> i m in the same situation as you are </s>
<s> same budget and everything </s>
<s> anyway this is the setup i m most likely going with intel core 2 duo e6750 evga nforce 680i sli nvidia socket 775 atx motherboard 2x corsair dual channel 1024mb pc6400 ddr2 800mhz evga geforce 8800 gts 640mb western digital caviar se16 500gb hdd sony dru830a cd dvd burner silverstone fp34 black internal 26 in 1 card reader writer drive ocz gamexstream 700 watt power supply thermaltake kandalf lcs case windows xp professional that s what my list looks like at the moment but i don t think it will be changing a whole lot </s>
<s> this is about what our budget will allow </s>
<s> of course you could always go with a less expensive case in order to get more memory better gpu or better cpu </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> that s a good setup except it looks like you re sticking with on board sound </s>
<s> you can find an x fi gamer for about 40 and it will give you better sound quality and higher framerates when compared to integrated sound </s>
<s> thanks for help man yeah im kind of thinking about a sli setup thanks for all the rest though </s>
<s> it is pretty close to what you want </s>
<s> and about 1900 </s>
<s> replaced the e6600 with an e6750 and kicked up that psu that would be pretty good right there </s>
<s> yeah i was looking at intel new line of processors and i though i d take that new e6850 my friend is selling it to me on 275 and a case that came with a 1000watt psu for 280 also im getting that gamer fatal1ty sound card for 130 and im going for 2 8800gts but the 320mb model thanks for all the help though i whole machine will come at2087 with tax included so i guess is a good piece of hardware </s>
<s> firstly its impossible to build a computer to pre empt unreleased games secondly directx 10 was made obslete at the announcement release of directx 10 1 not to mention that game development for the pc has become questionable at best due to the popularity and equality of consoles contrasted to the massive performance delta between the average pc and the performance pc </s>
<s> thirdly nvidia and ati are planning to release new graphics processors in about 5 or 6 months replacing geforce 8 and radeon hd 2xxx </s>
<s> also theres no real advantage to having a creative card don t really care what anand says over integrated audio in regards to quality performance etc </s>
