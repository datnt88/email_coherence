<s> i have western digital external hard drive that is compatible with both pc and mac </s>
<s> it was working fine with both and now it does not work with pc </s>
<s> when i connect it with mac i am able to view all the files and can copy edit etc </s>
<s> however when i connect it with a pc i can see the drive but i cannot see the content in the drive </s>
<s> what could be the problem with it </s>
<s> could i have deleted some of the files </s>
<s> is there any way i can do to fix this problem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> have you checked those posts </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> but since it s working you have the opportunity to save your files on your backup </s>
<s> then you can format it again on the pc and on your mac copy the files back onto that drive </s>
<s> there are thousands of prior discussions </s>
