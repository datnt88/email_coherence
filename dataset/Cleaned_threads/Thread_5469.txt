<s> i don t know if will be helpful or not but i had the same problem with all 3 of my optical drives </s>
<s> the culprit was slysoft s anydvd </s>
<s> i would suggest that you check to see if this particular piece of software is on your machine </s>
<s> after going into the registry and deleting all references to slysoft and anydvd and rebooting all 3 optical drives reappeared </s>
<s> good luck </s>
