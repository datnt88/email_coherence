<s> first off i own a gateway gt4016 desktop computer </s>
<s> on the front there s a little panel thing in one of the slots like where the dvd drive is fixed that has a usb connection and two slots labeled quot sd mmc sm ms ms pro xd quot and quot cf microdrive quot </s>
<s> i being the genius that i am inserted my cf card from my camera into the cf drive but i think i did it backwards </s>
<s> it wasn t reading and didn t click or anything so i got tweezers to try to pull it out but that just pushed it in more and now i can t even try to pull it out from the front </s>
<s> it doesn t read on my computer and whenever i try to open the drive called quot compactflashi ii h quot it says i need to insert a disk </s>
<s> if i click eject it does nothing </s>
<s> my question is how do i go about getting my card back out </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> most desktops allow the removal of the covers skins </s>
<s> if your system allows this then remove the frt </s>
<s> bezel cover </s>
<s> you ll gain greater access maybe the depth of the bezel removed will be enough to grip the cf card </s>
<s> otherwise if that area itself can be removed as like a cage unit to gain further access w o actually tearing down the unit itself </s>
<s> you ll still have to open case etc </s>
<s> to get into this </s>
<s> all this info is generic in nature you have to check then proceed </s>
<s> i exclude any possible damage that may have happened if the cf card port was permanent </s>
<s> all those memory cards i can t recall if it used contact pins to mount vs pads on the cf card </s>
<s> you ll need to inspect after cf removal the card and port for continued us </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> try this see if the lower right corner of the screen where the system tray are show a white box with a upward green arror that same icon you see if you have a usb drive installed in if yes try clicking it </s>
<s> try to see if you can eject the card treating it like if it was a usb drive 2nd option start computer then you will see a listing of all your drive right click on the drive where your card is see if you can get a pop up menu with the word eject showing as one of the menu choice try clicking the eject from there to see if the card will come out good luck </s>
