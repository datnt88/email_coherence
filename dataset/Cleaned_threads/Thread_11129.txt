<s> thanks to anyone who did the research and is willing to share it </s>

<s> that the fcc limits power emissions in any one direction so all makers are playing from the same rule book </s>
<s> good routers tend to all blur into a group of good routers with bad routers finding bad comments so no one router stands out </s>
<s> this is hard for most to accept </s>
<s> that is some think there is a router that will outperform all other routers by say 2 times </s>
<s> that s untrue yet you find people researching this </s>
<s> here i use post 18 of this forum sticky if i need better coverage and it costs so little that maybe that s why many won t do that </s>
