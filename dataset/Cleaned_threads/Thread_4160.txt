<s> i am wondering if i should swich over to mozerilla firefox from ie </s>
<s> i have heard a bunch of good about it just wondering what everyones opinion on it was </s>
<s> does it get junky all the upgrades and stuff </s>
<s> seeing as ie is the main target for virus and spyware writers i only use ie for windows updates or any of those web sites that still only use ie proprietary html that doesn t always work in other browsers </s>
<s> why not try firefox </s>
<s> if you like it you will stay with it </s>
<s> if not you can always uninstall it </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> mozilla firefox has become my workhorse browser </s>
<s> lots of add ons for whatever you need </s>
<s> as many others do for security reasons i only use ie for windows updates code testing and those sites that require ie </s>
<s> ciao </s>
<s> i use it and prefer it </s>
<s> for some strange reason ie quot hangs up quot and i usually have to exit and re enter the program i don t have this problem with firefox that s why i prefer it </s>
<s> like others have said why not try it you can always un install it if you don t like it </s>
<s> occasionally rarely is more accurate a website will require ie i simply close the firefox browser and fire up the ie hoping it doesn t freeze up </s>
