<s> could someone please help me make up my mind </s>
<s> i am a tablet virgin looking to finally pop my cherry </s>
<s> i am looking to not spend alot of money and im not a techie </s>
<s> i will be using it for online classes research test taking blogging reading and my son will be using it to play games and watch movies at home and on trips </s>
<s> i know that with the nexus comes google play and other apps but it doesnt have hdmi port or sd card slot and less onboard storage 8gb vs 32gb </s>
<s> they have the same screen resolution but the asus is 10 quot vs 7 quot for the nexus </s>
<s> does the asus have an app that i can download a bunch of games for free or at least inexpensively as well as some shows and movies if i went with it instead of the nexus </s>
<s> i could really use some advice </s>
<s> i found them to be subpar for such applications </s>

<s> no i have never even used a tablet </s>
<s> tablets are not laptop replacements for creating app docs yet </s>
<s> you see folk are trying this by adding keyboards but many have run out and bought these without checking it all out ahead of time </s>
<s> a few are quite burned up about it </s>
<s> these things will get better but for now test drive it before spending your money </s>
