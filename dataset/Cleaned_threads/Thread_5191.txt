<s> my cousin just graduated with her nursing degree and wanted to clean up her computer </s>
<s> she backed up all of her pictures and handed over the laptop with all the discs that came with it </s>
<s> i formatted and installed a fresh new version of windows xp on it </s>
<s> it is a dell inspiron 600m </s>
<s> i am at work with it open on my desk here </s>
<s> i have my own laptop and 2 monitors and one of the network switches is right under my desk </s>
<s> we also have 2 different wireless signals for just my company alone </s>
<s> i still cannot get internet </s>
<s> the laptop worked fine before i re installed </s>
<s> i have gone to dell com and downloaded the drivers put them on my memory stick moved them to her laptop and installed them </s>
<s> the wireless shows the networks available </s>
<s> i have put in my passwords and it says connected and signal strength excellent </s>
<s> i clicked on the internet explorer icon and it gave me the connections wizard </s>
<s> i chose to set up my connection manually and then connect to a network that is always connected or always on </s>
<s> still nothing </s>
<s> no matter what page i get internet explorer could not open the search page please help if you have any idea what i can do </s>
<s> i promised this back by thanksgiving </s>
<s> best cv </s>
<s> check the wireless symbol in system notication area for a status like quot limited or no connectivity quot </s>
<s> the symbol changes also </s>
<s> that has nothing to do with the signal strength but everything with not being given an ip address by the wireless dhcp server </s>
<s> you can check that with ipconfig or usually on the router management page </s>
<s> the usual cause is a non matching encryption mode or encryption key or the mac address not passing the mac filtering on the router </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> the most that it changes is from excellent to very good </s>
<s> i ve seen the quot limited or no connectivity quot before on another computer but i m not getting that </s>
<s> it has also said wireless connection unavailable but only for a few seconds and then it went back </s>
<s> i cannot get ipconfig to work </s>
<s> i must be doing it wrong i m hitting start gt run gt then typing ipconfig </s>
<s> i think that i may have the wrong ethernet driver </s>
<s> i am 100 certain that the cable i have hooked up to it is working it was before </s>
<s> there are so many network drivers on the support page for this laptop that i don t know what is right </s>
<s> maybe if someone could look at that for me and make suggestions as far as the driver </s>
<s> i should at least be getting a wired signal </s>
<s> type ipconfig thru start run </s>
<s> you do it in a command dos window </s>
<s> if you are testing inside a company chances are they have mac filtering or some other wireless security implemented </s>
<s> take the laptop to a coffee shop with wifi or some other hotspot and check there </s>
<s> you won t get to surf until you have a password but if you reach their login page you know you have good wlan connection </s>
<s> o yes generally a wired connection works by just plugging in </s>
<s> if that doesn t work it s most likely a driver problem </s>
<s> given what you did that could be motherboard drivers </s>
<s> didn t there come something like a quot driver and utilities cd quot with the laptop </s>
<s> i m afraid your on your own with regard to selecting the right drivers from the manufacturers site </s>
<s> i once managed it for a lenovo t30 rather satisfactorily because everything seems to work except the help key </s>
<s> kees </s>
