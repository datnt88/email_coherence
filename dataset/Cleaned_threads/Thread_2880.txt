<s> i just recently bought a new video card an ati radeon 9250 256mb agp card </s>
<s> my old card was an ati radeon 7200 64mb agp card </s>
<s> when i went to switch them out my computer didn t recognize the new one yet it still runs fine with the old one </s>
<s> basically my monitor never recieves a signal and it gives me the error sound of a long beep followed by 2 short beeps </s>
<s> i hooked the card up to another older computer running a nvidia geforce pci card and it booted up fine </s>
<s> the old computer is 5 years older than mine </s>
<s> i ve tried everything i can think of and i m stumped </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> perhaps you have a mobo that can t accept an agp 4x 8x card </s>
<s> i have an aopen mx34 motherboard </s>
<s> i ran some checks and looked on the site and it said the agp port was 1x 2x and 4x </s>
<s> this is not a problem </s>
<s> what is a problem is quot you haven t installed the new card quot </s>
<s> you can t until you uninstall the old one </s>
<s> open quot device manager quot and remove old card go to control panel add remove and remove software for old card </s>
<s> shut down </s>
<s> then you can remove old card and install new card </s>
<s> xp or any other os will then see new card when you boot up </s>
<s> a piece of advice i have noticed on a lot of hardware even newer stuff will not install from xp quot autorun quot </s>
<s> my ati 9250 card is one of them </s>
<s> when you put the disc in stop autorun and open disc manually </s>
<s> first read the instructions may be readme file </s>
<s> important </s>
<s> sometimes things have to installed in a certain order and some things may not be necessary for your computer </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> when you installed the new card in the old pc and it booted up ok were you using the same monitor or a different one </s>
<s> it s very rare that a video card and monitor have a compatibility issue with a particular motherboard but i have encountered such things on very rare occasions </s>
<s> try a different monitor if you have one this would be the easiest first step to trouble shoot the problem </s>
<s> if this doesn t work check to see if your motherboard bios is the latest revision available </s>
<s> if not update and try again </s>
<s> does your system bios have options for agp </s>
<s> if so make sure you select the right compatibility mode for your new configuration </s>
<s> hope this helps cindy </s>
<s> try booting the pc without any video card new or old </s>
<s> did you get the same number sequence of beeps </s>
<s> if so the mobo isn t happy with the card </s>
<s> try clearing the cmos page 13 of your manual using the procedure below </s>
<s> 1 turn off the system and unplug the ac power </s>
<s> 2 remove atx power cable from connector pwr2 </s>
<s> 3 locate jp14 and short pins 2 3 for a few seconds </s>
<s> 4 return jp14 to its normal setting by shorting pins 1 2 </s>
<s> 5 connect atx power cable back to connector pwr2 </s>
<s> now try booting with the new card </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
