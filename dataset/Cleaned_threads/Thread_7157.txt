<s> i recently installed a cd rw drive in my computer </s>
<s> it was purchased from an electronics store as rebuilt </s>
<s> it s frankensteined </s>
<s> before the cd rw was installed the cd rom drive worked fine </s>
<s> now after the install it doesn t recognize and cd including music cds games or blank discs </s>
<s> i have uninstalled and reinstalled the drive in device management i have physically re installed both drives swapping the cables and the master slave jumpers i have checked the drive properties and they say the device is working properly </s>
<s> i have also checked to see if there is a hardware conflict </s>
<s> none </s>
<s> i booted in safe mode and the drive still won t read discs </s>
<s> i have also cleaned the drive with a cd drive cleaning disc </s>
<s> i m thinking that my 40 pin cable connecting the cd rom drive may be faulty at the connection </s>
<s> anybody have suggestions or ideas </s>
<s> not wanting to replace the drive as i know it s good it works in my other computer </s>
<s> make sure you have 40 pin 80 wire type cable </s>
<s> then use either the master slave setup to connect </s>
<s> if that doesn t work use the cs jumper instead for both </s>
<s> its important to use the newer type of cable for best operation </s>
<s> if the problem still persists then the new cd drive just isn t capable to reside with the other cd drive or its really old </s>
<s> quite frankly you could have done better with a dvd drive that s cd and dvd capable even as a burner </s>
<s> besides being newer and usually more open to the setup </s>
<s> you didn t provide details of make and model etc </s>
<s> the details of your pc os etc the provided info is generic so use as it pertains </s>
<s> also are there any bios updates what do they do </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> you wrote ide but here s my plea </s>
<s> please know the rules about ide cables and jumpers </s>
<s> these are easy to find today so let s hope it s that </s>
<s> also after i move drives around i boot windows to safe mode and remove all the cd dvd drives there so on the next boot windows will refresh all the drives </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you start out by saying quot you wrote ide but quot nobody in this thread said anything about ide until you did </s>
<s> and i do know the rules for ide cables and jumpers </s>
<s> the master goes on the end and the slave in the middle with the appropriate jumpers set for each </s>
<s> that was stated in my post </s>
<s> the computer is an amalgam of three or four computers and to be honest i don t remember the specifics </s>
<s> i can access them and post them but everything was working fine until that cd rw went in </s>
<s> i am going to take the ide cable out and put in a newer one and if that doesn t work i will set both jumpers to cs and let the computer figure out what is what </s>
<s> thanks for the generic your word information </s>
<s> i appreciate your time and effort in helping with this issue </s>
<s> as to ide and such </s>
<s> you wrote 40 pin cable so yes there was an odd 40 pin scsi from the 90 s but i doubt that was it </s>
<s> take a moment to reflect on your reply </s>
<s> will you get more help if you sound a little tense </s>
<s> but do try that safe boot item </s>
<s> i ve lost count how many times it helped </s>
<s> best of luck </s>
