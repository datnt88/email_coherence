<s> i about fell off my chair when i came across this review this morning we ordered a pc from alienware amost 8 weeks ago </s>
<s> it was supposed to arrive 8 28 </s>
<s> we finally got fed up and cancelled the order yesterday 10 6 </s>
<s> the number of excuses alieware can come up with as to why they haven t built and shipped your pc is mind boggling </s>
<s> i can only hope we don t have to contact the florida state attorney general and the federal trade commision to get the 3400 charge removed from our credit card </s>
<s> cnet stop stop stop stop promoting alienware </s>
<s> they are turning your store ratings into a joke </s>
<s> 4 stars for alienware gimme a break </s>
<s> you might even find micahel dell s information and e mail him directly the acquisition was announced in march to be complete after regulatory approval there s no pr at the alienware site to say the deal has been sommuated however so it may still be in process </s>
<s> dave k </s>
<s> i knew that dell bought alienware </s>
<s> my problem is with cnet continuing to give alienware a 4 star rating </s>
<s> you don t show reviews that people post for stores only products </s>
<s> you check any other reseller rating site and you will find dozens of bad reviews for this company yet cnet continues to give them 4 starts </s>
<s> here on cnet you don t see what an awful time people are having with this company unless you read the reviews for alienware products </s>
<s> it s turning your own store ratings into a joke </s>
<s> look at yet here they are on cnet with 4 out of 5 stars </s>
<s> i was in exactly the same boat but i decided not to allow alienware to drag me along that long </s>
<s> when they started giving me delivery dates that were a month longer than they said when i placed the purchase i immediately cancelled and built the system myself </s>
<s> my dollars speak for themselves i build the same system for about 1500 less and used the difference to buy a nice dell for my niece </s>
<s> i ll never buy again now that i ve built a system on my own </s>
<s> cookiebun i am sorry to hear about the trouble you have had with your order </s>
<s> just out of curiosity which system did you order </s>
<s> was it the same one from the review </s>

<s> we cancelled our order with alienware and decided to build my husband s new gaming rig ourselves </s>
<s> we spent about 3000 at newegg com </s>
