<s> how is it going my pc is making me ponder </s>
<s> i have a 256 mb ddr 400 cl3 stick in a 3000 amd sempron my q is why is my available physical memory only showing 30mb yet my total physical memory is 256mb </s>
<s> i am running xp but the computer is only 1 month old and i am only running internet explorer on it also if i want to upgrade my ram to hopefully solve that issue and have it run quicker do i have to buy same brand or can i get any other brand as long as it is 256mb ddr 400 </s>
<s> i have 4 slots on my memory area how much can i upgrade to </s>
<s> a million thanx for being there ps is there ever going to be the perfect computer </s>
<s> 512 mb </s>
<s> no need to buy the same brand </s>
<s> if you have four slots it makes me suspect that the mobo provides support for dual channel memory </s>
<s> are the four slots all the same color </s>
<s> maybe tell us what mobo you have </s>
<s> do you have the manual for the mobo </s>
<s> that should tell you the maximum amount of memory the mobo will support and the largest size stick that you can put in one slot </s>
<s> for me re dual channel i don t know if the sempron s support dual channel </s>
<s> possible the mobo supports it for the big brother cpu but not for the reduced capability sempron </s>
<s> what type cpu socket does the mobo use 754 939 or 940 </s>
<s> the 30 mb memory issue is referring to memory not in use at that moment </s>
<s> the operating system will use as much memory that it needs at any moment </s>
<s> when it runs low it uses virtual memory page file the hard drive which then slows things down a little </s>
<s> you can always check in task manager to see how much of each is being used </s>
<s> identify the memory type and upgrade options at crucial com by your computer brand and name </s>
<s> after you find the type of memory and amount of memory each memory slot can handle shop around </s>
<s> nklein </s>
<s> you may be using a virtual memory operating system os </s>
<s> linux windows macosx should use every scrap of ram since ram wins on speed compared to disk access </s>
<s> when more ram is needed it s freed or something is swapped out </s>
<s> the concept of quot free memory quot is something you worried about in non vm oses such as dos </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> either socket a or 754 thus they will not support dual channel </s>
<s> if you have a socket 754 mobo the only way you can use dual channel with it is to use a fx51 cpu and registered memory </s>
<s> thus no specific rules re putting in more same type memory </s>
<s> thanx for your message regarding the memory slots i looked that up and it seems i have 4 total 2 blue color and 2 black color i cheched crucial com and it seems i am only allowed ddr modules 400 cl3 </s>
<s> i am not sure what my mobo is since the pc was open box and it didn t come with any manuals nor discs </s>
<s> thanx for your help </s>
<s> for some reason they were talking about you in the speakeasy forums </s>
<s> i personally don t like the speakeasy forums as i have issues with the people in them </s>
<s> if you have that information see what the mfg recommends </s>
<s> you could also go to corsair com and crucial com and see what they say works with your pc </s>
