<s> my computer has been acting up on start ups and never quite make it to the window s login screen without several reboots on startup </s>
<s> i replaced the power supply and the graphics card since the fan on both components were not spinning even though i had a successful start up </s>
<s> however my startup problem still persists and comes and go </s>
<s> sometimes while i am online the system will just reboot as if a ghost in the machine is in control </s>
<s> i ve already tried formatting the hd and re installing xp pro </s>
<s> the system is clean of any other software </s>
<s> are there utilities out there that let s me test the memory hd graphics card and other components </s>
<s> is the software free </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
<s> i think you misunderstand me </s>
<s> my computer is not sluggish nor does it have a virus </s>
<s> what i have is a hardware issue that i can t seem to pinpoint and i was wondering if there is a software out there that can assist with locating the hardware problem so that it can test the sound card graphics card memory hd cd rom floppy and anything else </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> try the free lite version first just to get a feel for it </s>
<s> the problem with these sorts of progs is that your not using the windows drivers as long as you understand that then i suppose they are of some value </s>
<s> anyway the price is right so give it a test drive </s>
<s> i went to their site and was so impressed i purchased the pro version </s>
<s> sharpwitz geeks com sells a diagnostic kit that traces the codes during post for under 30 </s>
<s> this gadget installs on a pci slot </s>
<s> it comes with a booklet containing all the code definitions </s>
<s> it s helped me a few times </s>
<s> between the two of them you should be able to isolate the problem </s>
<s> sorry for the misunderstanding </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
