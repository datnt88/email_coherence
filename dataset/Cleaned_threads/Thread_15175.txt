<s> so a desktop that i have started slowing down performance wise and then would just freeze up on me </s>
<s> after about 2 weeks of just degenerating like this the shutdown time was pretty steady with it freezing up in 30 60 minutes </s>
<s> when it got to this point i got an error message during bootup that stated it could not detect a hard drive </s>
<s> if i left the pc alone for a while at least a couple of hours i could boot up again into windows but again after half an hour it would freeze with the no hd message again </s>
<s> i would also boot up with a cd knoppix and my hd would dissapear just the same after bout half an hour </s>
<s> at first i thought it might be a bad hd so no biggie buy a new one </s>
<s> but here s what s changed </s>
<s> i went into my pc not through my regular account but through the administrator account and now it s been on hour about a day without incident </s>
<s> so now i m confused </s>
<s> could it be that the bad part of the hd was related to the area used by the user account and since now i m on the administrator it hasn t accessed that area and thus has not crashed </s>
<s> or is there a possibility that this could be virus software related </s>
<s> haven t seen one that acts this way specially with the initial boot error that now seems to have dissapeared as well </s>
<s> any thought on this would be appreciated thanks </s>
<s> by the way in case it helps winxp home </s>
<s> of the hdd at question </s>
<s> give it a test and eliminate that as a problem </s>
<s> how long has it been since you ve cleaned out the dust bunnies in the case </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i ll download the diagnostics for and update </s>
<s> as for the case i had cleaned it out couple of months before </s>
