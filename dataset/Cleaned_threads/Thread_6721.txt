<s> hello everyone </s>
<s> there s new hardware now compared to when i first got into the hardware aspect of computers and it confuses me </s>
<s> for instance in this image of a motherboard what are those two white slots between the black and blue slots </s>
<s> in addition what are the black blue slots </s>
<s> down and left of the black heat sync there are four slots what are they </s>
<s> is that big red thing another weird shaped heat sync </s>
<s> what is up with all the different power supply connectors </s>
<s> some like on this mb have twenty pin 2x10 connectors on one area of the motherboard and another four pin 2x2 connector here at the top right near the processor </s>
<s> some have just twenty and some have twenty four and another four </s>
<s> it s confusing how can people expect their power supply to work on a motherboard unless they carefully check </s>
<s> one other curiosity of mine why do these new power supplies need the extra four pins and why separate </s>
<s> thanks good day </s>
<s> christopher </s>
<s> that s the longest url i ve seen yet on these forums </s>
<s> maybe next time you can do a lt carraige return gt or two so we don t have to search for the rest on our walls or someplace </s>
<s> here you go everything you ever wanted to know about this motherboard and were afraid to ask and life goes on jack </s>
<s> anyways a the small ones are pcie x1 slots b the large ones are pcie x16 slots for sli c 20pin 4pin has been the standard for atx power since the year 2000 with the introduction of the pentium 4 the 24 pin is just to provide even more power d most psu s ship as 20 4 or 24 4 none ship w o the extra 4 pin e yes the red thing is a specially shaped heatsink for the asus board it s just an asus design i have an abit that has the nb hs actually cut so that it says abit from certain angles abit vt7 f those blue connectors are serial ata or serial ata ii and have been around for a while also that board uses ddr2 just fyi and features the new lga 775 quot socket quot t interface for intel pentium 4 and pentium d processors also if you notice that board has the following for power input 1 24 pin atx connector 1 4 pin atx connector 1 4 pin molex connector any other questions </s>
<s> yeah sorry about that i didn t even realize it was that long i had just copied pasted from the address bar to my post </s>
<s> for some reason i figured the url would automatically wrap but i guess not </s>
<s> i will make sure to carraige return in the future </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> a detailed motherboard map is in the manual on p 2 3 acrobat reader navigation page 29 p5nd2 sli deluxe manual warning </s>
