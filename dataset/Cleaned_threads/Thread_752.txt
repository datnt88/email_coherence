<s> hello all lately i have been encountering a lot of internet problems regarding the range of wifi throughout my house </s>
<s> i am unable to get wifi in one side on my basement as well as very spotty connections on the third floor </s>
<s> i am also have a lot of dropped connections throughout the house </s>
<s> i tried building a parabolic reflector as well as placing the router in different locations with no improvements in wifi range or stability </s>
<s> my question is should i wire my house for ethernet </s>
<s> i use my laptop throughout the house </s>
<s> all in all there are 5 laptops an xbox 360 ps3 as well as a few portable devices cell phones ipod etc </s>
<s> all the laptops are predominantly used without batteries they are plugged into the wall </s>
<s> my tenant plays a lot of online games on the his ps3 but has issues with the wifi dropping out </s>
<s> i know wiring a completed house is a lot of work but i dont have a problem doing some labor if its worth it </s>
<s> i also want to be cost efficient </s>
<s> in an ideal world basically i would want to be able to connect anywhere in the house have reliable connections and have good speeds to stream movies and download content </s>
<s> current router is dlink dir 625 </s>
<s> any help or advice would be much appreciated thanks in advance </s>
<s> have you tried using a wireless booster first this my work as it lets use position then through out the house so that you can get a stronger signal down stairs and farther </s>
<s> a wired home network would be ideal if you don t mind doing the work of running wires </s>
<s> once you run the wires you can even add wireless access points at those places where you need better wireless coverage </s>
<s> if you want to avoid the work though you may want to try out power line network adapters </s>
<s> they have worked well for me in a variety of situations and allow you the flexibility of moving the adapters to different areas of the house to give you connectivity </s>
<s> you can even add waps to these as well for wireless coverage in weak areas </s>
<s> as another poster mentioned if you can run the cables i d do it since that would give you some options wireless access points etc </s>
<s> if you are going to do the cable runs use cat 6 instead of cat 5 if you can since chances are you will eventually upgrade your hardware specifically the modem router from a g series to a more current n and cat 6 would give you a potential for better throughput </s>
<s> good luck </s>
