<s> i bought a new motherboard for the desktop i am building </s>
<s> i was wider if it has an am3 processor socket will it work with any amd processor with an am3 plug in </s>
<s> or do i have to buy a certain processor </s>
<s> amd complicated things a bit in the am2 am2 and am3 phase of things </s>
<s> for instance you can t use an am2 processor in an am3 socket or later </s>
<s> you can use an am3 processor however in both am2 and am2 sockets </s>
<s> easiest thing is to look at what the motherboard manufacturer says will fit </s>
<s> almost always however if the socket and the processor descriptions are the same they will fit </s>
<s> you then have to worry about how much power you want to use when it s turned on how much heat you are willing to generate and deal with how much cpu power you need for what you do </s>
<s> for instance i have an amd phenom x4 processor on one computer which can be used for intensive stuff when needed </s>
<s> more often when i m just visiting forums reading emails maybe run a few low rez youtube videos i use a low power sempron processor on a linux box which i leave on most of the time </s>
<s> although higher power processors ramp down when at rest so do those already low power </s>
<s> a new sempron 45w might run at 25w when just resting </s>
<s> i doubt my phenom x4 processor on newer mobo drops to that level </s>
<s> fit processor to socket fit your expected power requirements fit your budget </s>
<s> thank you this helps a lot </s>
<s> you take the make and model of the mobo and visit the maker s site </s>
<s> you then look at the cpu support list </s>
<s> that will tell you what cpu s are supported and what bios level is needed </s>
