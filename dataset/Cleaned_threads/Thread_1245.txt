<s> i m getting a ide cable to cut down on dust and i need to know if ide cables are also compatible with dvd cd drives </s>
<s> did you plan on getting round cables </s>
<s> if so they work just fine with cd dvd drives </s>
<s> i don t know about cutting down on dust but i suppose it makes sense as they reduce clutter </s>
<s> also a big help for cooling as they permit better airflow </s>
<s> thanx alot </s>
<s> you re welcome </s>
<s> c j </s>
<s> the ide drive be certain to not get one that is too long </s>
<s> it can cause problems because some of the round ones have more cross talk and noise than the flat 80 conductor cables </s>
<s> the flat ones also should not be any longer than necessary </s>
<s> this does not apply to the atapi optical dvd et al drives because their data rate is substantially lower </s>
