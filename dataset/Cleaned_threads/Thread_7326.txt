<s> hey guys i was wondering if i could prepare and know which graphics card i should upgrade to </s>
<s> i don t really mind which brand though i would think to stick with ati </s>
<s> also please find graphics cards that are under the range of about 350 </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> specs graphics card not really needed ati radeon hd 5700 series chip type amd radeon graphics processor processor intel core i7 2600 cpu 3 40ghz ram 8 2gb </s>
<s> anyways here is my computer with full specs </s>
<s> after you pick the card see if your case is normal sized and then check your power supply </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> how would i find out if my case was normal sized and my power supply </s>
<s> would i need to open my computer for the power supply </s>
<s> also that link i gave with the full thing to my computer says quot chassis type microtower quot so would that be considered normal size </s>
<s> since i can t chance it i always look </s>
<s> since we re inside the case every 6 months to keep it clean it s just another thing to read while we re inside </s>
<s> as to the case size it wasn t clear to me so you can take measurements to see if a full size card fits and if there is a heat issue you can always cut a big hole in the case or leave a cover off </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> a few questions would a brand new power supply be needed </s>
<s> and im guessing this card can fit into my case and work with my computer </s>
<s> i was thinking of getting this card </s>
<s> heres a working link from above geforce gtx 650 ti </s>
<s> here s how i figure that out </s>
<s> i get the watts off the old supply and if it s the usual under 500 we take that number then add double the watts the new card will draw </s>
<s> reviews seem to write about 112 watts so we double that and add that to your current psu </s>
<s> now find a psu with a single 12v rail unless you are adept at figuring out amperes </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m not great with computers and don t really understand what your saying </s>
<s> but maybe i could give you some of the info you need and you can help me </s>
<s> i asked on another forum about a power supply and someone linked me this </s>
<s> 12v1 25a 12v2 25a however shows it s a dual rail supply </s>
<s> you ve told me enough that you want a single rail to avoid all those other questions </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i found some more info about my graphics card it is the hd 5770 and requires 450 watts to run i have 460 watts in my computer and the gtx 660 the one i want takes the same amount as hd 5770 </s>
<s> you re also falling into the trap of the just big enough psu </s>
<s> so we have a few issues to cover </s>
<s> are you going to exceed any psu rail </s>
<s> that s in amperes not watts most of the time how old is the psu </s>
<s> i ding the spec by 25 per year of age for the first 2 years </s>
