<s> i am guessing you are a dsl user </s>
<s> dsl usually uses pppoe software ppp over ethernet </s>
<s> this gives you a login prompt using ppp </s>
<s> pppoe is considered a tunnel protocol </s>
<s> you seem to have multiple virtual adapters when you should only have 1 try to uninstall your the software your isp gave you and delete all of those virtual adapters </s>
<s> then reboot the computer and reinstall the software </s>
<s> or buy a router for 50 and let it do the pppoe for you </s>
<s> you will benefit with a small performance increase and some security </s>
<s> worms and hackers will be probing the router instead of your pc </s>
<s> if you buy a router you will not need the isp software any more </s>

<s> sorry i was not very specific yes i have dsl and i do have a router </s>
<s> actually we have 2 computers and the other one that is connected quot with wire lan cable quot to the router has no problems at all mine was connected wireless and had no problems at all too </s>
<s> now i disconnected the other pc and i trying to make the laptop work quot with wire lan cable quot </s>
<s> at the beginning i thought it might be the wireless card even though the computer receives perfect signal </s>
<s> i don t know anyway i think my isp didn t give me any software could that be </s>
<s> the sw i installed was the one of the router lynksys thanks again </s>
<s> please let me know if you thinks is something else </s>

<s> why i have virtually adapters </s>
<s> i had kind of the same problem and somebody told me to check if my connection was bridged </s>

<s> go to show all my connections </s>
<s> look to see if the connection that you are using to connect to the internet is bridged </s>
<s> normally it will say the name of the connection the next line will tell you if is connected or not followed for the word quot bridged quot or quot firewalled quot if you see the word quot bridge quot right click and look for quot unbridge connection quot click on it and the connection should unbridged by itself </s>
<s> good luck </s>
