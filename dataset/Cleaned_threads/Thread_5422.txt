<s> i have a toshiba satellite a105 s4014 with a matshita dvd ram uj 841s </s>
<s> the os is xp media sp2 </s>
<s> my matshita worked fine for a long time </s>
<s> suddenly it was no longer being recognized or was being discovered as new hardware and loading drivers </s>
<s> sometimes it would show up as what it was supposed to sometimes not </s>
<s> it was always a garbled variant of matshita dvd ram uj 841s </s>
<s> i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers to no avail and sought software conflicts with the same results </s>
<s> i started thinking i had a bad loose cable so with a nervous heart i took my notebook apart </s>
<s> i found no internal cabling problems </s>
<s> disappointed i started putting it back together </s>
<s> i had it almost completely reassembled when i noticed something </s>
<s> my dvd ram is held in the chassis by a single screw no handy latches </s>
<s> the screw hole only lined up with the dvd ram sticking out of the chassis about 1 16 inches </s>
<s> i considered this to be far enough that the connection probably didn t seat properly with the screw in </s>
<s> i pulled the device out of the chassis and took a look </s>
<s> the screw that holds it in place goes through the bottom of the notebook case and into a tab that sticks out the back of the dvd ram </s>
<s> i tweak the tab with a pair of pliers so that the screw hold would line up properly with the dvd ram seated completely in the chassis and the connector would thus be seated properly </s>
<s> it worked </s>
<s> i am now very happy </s>
<s> my matshita is recognized and running at all times </s>
<s> john s </s>
<s> the problem probably started with the cd tray getting bumped a few times while sticking out </s>
<s> beware </s>
