<s> os windows vista home premium speakers 5 1 i turned on my computer the other day and noticed that where there would normally be sound there was only a hissing noise </s>
<s> i checked my cables and ensured that everything was plugged in </s>
<s> i checked the sound controls and made sure that nothing was muted </s>
<s> none of my setting had changed </s>
<s> i normally listen to music and such on a daily basis so i know the sound had been functioning just recently </s>
<s> i uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers </s>
<s> i googled for solutions </s>
<s> i m completely bewildered </s>
<s> i should add that the hissing noise only occurs when there would normally be sound </s>
<s> if i turn up the volume on my speakers the hissing gets louder </s>
<s> however if i reduce the sound through the software the hissing remains at the level set by my speakers </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas </s>
<s> on the s w side was there any recent system updates or system installs etc </s>
<s> if not then very possible the audio portion just got blown away it happens </s>
<s> see if using plain 2 1 audio works or similar </s>
<s> if you have a testing pgm </s>
<s> as some audio pgms </s>
<s> do use it </s>
<s> even though you checked the cabling has anyone else been at work </s>
<s> also verify the cabling again </s>
<s> try the speakers elsewhere is possible </s>
<s> as for the audio ckt </s>
<s> check the mtrbd card in the areas in question for burnt or obvious damage </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i confirmed that speakers do work on another system </s>
<s> also i am the only on who uses this computer and the cabling is relatively difficult to accidentally move </s>
<s> i do not see any burnt areas on the motherboard </s>
<s> audio test programs hiss at me </s>
<s> i don t know what you mean by 2 1 audio honestly i m not really a sound guy </s>
<s> can you explain </s>
