<s> i have a six year old computer with a reset button on the tower </s>
<s> this button is convenient because when a screen freezes up it is easier to press the reset button than to press ctrl </s>
<s> alt </s>
<s> and delete </s>
<s> i need to buy a new computer but the stores that i visited only sell computers that do not have reset buttons </s>
<s> if i buy a computer without a reset button how would i fix a frozen screen </s>
<s> thank you very much </s>
<s> if you buy a new computer one would think a frozen screen to be very rare </s>
<s> if necessary you can depress the power button for up to 10 sec and the machine will power off you can then restart </s>
<s> xp is so much more stable than w95 98 </s>
<s> that s why the reset button is gone </s>
<s> xp can recover from frozen screens if and when they ever happen </s>
<s> i have four pcs running xp home and pro and it never happens to me </s>
<s> then again pressing the power button for gt 5 seconds powers off and you can power back up </s>
