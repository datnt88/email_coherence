<s> the free printer does not come with a cable so you ll need to get one for about 25 </s>
<s> jason </s>
<s> there is better out there </s>
<s> emachines t6520 package for 669 97 after rebates better cpu with 64 bit capability more ram larger harddrive pci express x16 for upgrades better ati xpress 200 chipset with 128mb of shared memory for integrated graphics </s>
<s> 15 in </s>
<s> lcd monitor however i would reccomend the emachines t6522 for 689 97 after rebates </s>
<s> better cpu with 64 bit capability larger harddrive than the dell and t6420 more ram than the dell has a tv tuner unlike the t6520 and your dell 3000 pci express x16 for upgradability socket 939 motherboard however if you were willing to spend close to a grand without rebates then you could go dual core </s>
<s> these systems are more then your 3000 with the free printer and extended waranty </s>
<s> however you get so much more for only a 100 difference </s>
<s> better deal </s>
<s> that first computer is selling for 1000 though </s>
<s> and those are without any warranty </s>
<s> also chip seems worse than what i m getting with the 3000 </s>
<s> in terms of performance especially in gaming the amd athlon 64 has always been superior to the intel p4 in most catagories </s>
<s> just look at the benchmarks </s>
<s> note that the first system i showed you had the athlon 64 3400 and the other was the 3500 </s>
<s> intel has got caught in the clockspeed war thinking that more clockspeed equals faster cpu </s>
<s> that is not true </s>
<s> without getting technical amd has found otherways to find performance with their chips design such as a fast fsb front side bus </s>
<s> the best cpu out there is an amd fx 57 not an intel </s>
<s> if you want some technical stuff read this discussion also note that the p4 in your dell does not have 64 bit capability which will be necessary for future applications </s>
<s> in other words the emachines will last longer </s>
<s> in regards to the warranty all emachines feature a 1 year limited warranty that feature 1 one year guarantee on parts and labor </s>
<s> 2 one year technical support via telephone </s>
<s> you can read about it if 1 year isn t long enough for you you can purchase an extended warranty through emachines </s>
<s> just scroll down on that page </s>
<s> also circuitcity and bestbuy will offer their own warranties to you as well </s>
<s> either way your covered </s>
<s> imo if your computer has faulty hardware or software you will see a problem within 1 year and extended waranties are unnecessary </s>
<s> if you take care of your computer you will not need it </s>
<s> also note that if you buy a dell printer ink is not popular in stores such as staples officemax and walmart </s>
<s> so you will need to buy your ink online if you buy a dell printer </s>
<s> those computers are both in the 1000 range but with rebates they are within your budget </s>
<s> i know this is not the main point of this chain but since the printer cable was at least brought up earlier i thought i would through my 2 cents in </s>
<s> yes you do need a printer cable if you get the dell printer </s>
<s> i think you may need it for about any printer they just don t come with them for some reason but instead of the 25 from dell bst buy circuit city try ebay </s>
<s> i got a 10 ft one for 2 99 i found for little stuff like cords and cables ebay has great prices </s>
<s> another example i got a 10 ft ethernet cord for like 5 99 30 in normal stores again minor point but still something i thought i would mention </s>
<s> i was aware to buy usb on ebay thanks though </s>
<s> any other recommendations on items wires computer items that are better purchased on ebay instead of by dealer </s>
