<s> we woke up one morning to find that our computer wouldn t go past the hp screen </s>
<s> an internet search revealed the problem was probably a bad hard drive </s>
<s> so we bought a new one from a computer store and i installed it </s>
<s> i couldn t get into bios to tell it to locate the new drive though </s>
<s> afterwards i went to use the system recovery discs purchased from hp but it s not working </s>
<s> i ve gotten two errors 0xc00000e9 and 0xe0ef0003 </s>
<s> on a couple of occasions i got to the hp recovery disc option screen and first tried choosing to quot restore to factory quot and then when that failed tried telling it to check the computer </s>
<s> it responded that i needed to put in the first recovery disc the one it was operating off of </s>
<s> so i removed it and reinserted it but it refused to recognize it and the drive door became unresponsive until i d restarted the computer </s>
<s> now i can t even get to the hp recovery screen options the error messages shut things down </s>
<s> my husband and i are both students we need this computer for our classes and i m completely out of ideas </s>
<s> i m not an expert this was my first shot at even installing a hard drive i used the hp whitepaper on it and am pretty sure things went ok with that although this failure is demoralizing </s>
<s> is there anyone out there who can give me a heads up on what to do </s>
<s> i read after installing the hd that hp puts a secret partition so only hard drives bought from them will boot with recovery discs is that the problem </s>
<s> arrgh </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> may not be your hard disk </s>
<s> it could be your cmos setting is corrupt or worse a failed chip somewhere </s>
<s> try to reset the cmos first to see if it will then boot recovery cd successfully </s>
<s> consult your manual or online for how to reset cmos </s>
<s> i hope you entered the bios and made the 1st boot device the cd dvd drive in order to proceed quickly to boot from disc and saved before exiting </s>
<s> otherwise it will error or complain and try to boot from hd and then goto the restore disc cd drive </s>
<s> if already done and set in the bios then you may have a further issue </s>
<s> hp and other provide a 2nd partition on their hds to access the restore recovery process </s>
<s> also this is where the creation of making your own restore recovery discs for you usage if needed </s>
<s> replacing the hd of course removes that option </s>
<s> provided you have working restore discs then it should the process </s>
<s> you say you have them but encounter problems </s>
<s> excluding any other issue quot do you trust the restore discs quot </s>
<s> if these are factory provided then ok if you made them some doubt maybe at work </s>
<s> otherwise in most cases it should have started the recovery process </s>
<s> the other half of this is not a recovery issue but a true h w fault with the mtrbd bios or related cause </s>
<s> if you have warranty then use it </s>
<s> you can post your query in the hp forum here and see where it leads </s>
<s> you maybe asked to drop this one and or be informed of any continuation of this thread </s>
<s> fyi i have found hp issues to be problematic in the last few yrs </s>
<s> and resolving them more hassle than encountered before </s>
<s> while success is at hand too often only a new part or factory supplied one seems to resolve the problem </s>
<s> basically imho it seems more constricted to apply true tested fixes from the past </s>
<s> lt div gt tada willy lt div gt </s>
<s> cmos is reset by removing the button battery yes </s>
<s> if so then i have done that both before and after replacing the drive </s>
<s> the discs are from the manufacturer </s>
<s> so according to you guys i can trust them </s>
<s> as far as changing any settings in bios i can t even get to it </s>
<s> the computer gets as far as the hp screen then freezes there </s>
<s> i ve tried repeatedly pressing the button that would cause it to go to the options shown on the hp screen not sure which one leads to bios but i think it s the one that you press esc for </s>
<s> doesn t do anything either i can t get in before it freezes or the new drive lacks anything on it for it to go to </s>
<s> the computer does start to run the recovery disc and gets as far as the recovery homepage so it knows it s there and is able to access it </s>
<s> but i can t get it to do anything from the disc </s>
<s> any chance replacing the sata cable would fix this </s>
<s> or is this for sure something like the motherboard </s>
<s> computer is about three years old and out of warranty </s>
<s> do homework like researching and reading manufacturers instructions on paper or online before diving in </s>
<s> in your case since all else failed what have you got to lose by reading the manual </s>
<s> clues the cmos reset is usually a dip switch but may vary by models so read and find it </s>
<s> the bios entry is usually f10 for hp but again may vary so read and find it </s>
<s> when you get to recovery cd homepage what does it offer </s>
<s> make sure kybd and mouse are ok if usb type plug in another port to try </s>
<s> stop fixating on hard disk as root cause </s>
<s> and hardware does die but less often than most owners think unless broken by their owners </s>
<s> troubleshooting and fixing a pc takes time and logic </s>
<s> impatience is not a virtue </s>
<s> i read the manual when i first got the computer </s>
<s> it doesn t mention cmos dip or bios </s>
<s> checked the hp website which was no help on resetting cmos but according to what i read online in other forums removing the button battery should ve done it </s>
<s> no information in the manual on bios but since i can t get into it that probably wouldn t help me anyway </s>
<s> the keyboard is working as is the mouse </s>
<s> the cd recovery homepage offers two options </s>
<s> one is to check the computer s functioning </s>
<s> the other is to restore to factory default </s>
<s> i ve tried both </s>
<s> neither of them work </s>
<s> hitting the f2 f10 or f11 key during boot up repeatedly should get you into the bios also called cmos </s>
<s> one of those keys should do it </s>
<s> sometimes hp is generic in providing info as they are similar to various hp models so don t be too disconcerted if not directly to your model </s>
<s> below is the problem solver hp webpage primary support webpage if all fails use the hp search button to find what you need </s>
<s> hp also provides an user form query there </s>
<s> sometimes common issues are resolved or fixes pointed to </s>
