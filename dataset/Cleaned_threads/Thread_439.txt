<s> i have 2 western digital raptors sata that i ve been running in raid0 1 as the boot drive c and the other as a data drive d </s>
<s> recently my motherboard died and i need to get the required data off the drives </s>
<s> my wife s computer is my old pc which is a p4s8x and has a fasttrack raid controller </s>
<s> my question is how do i attach one of my sata drives to her already running computer and have it be visible in windows so i can copy paste files i need </s>
<s> i do not want to format the drive </s>
<s> i added the drive to the computer and it was detected by the fasttrack controller and it wants me to setup an array for the drive </s>
<s> what should i do </s>
<s> if i setup an array for the drive will it be visible in bios windows or do i need to do more </s>
<s> will this erase the data </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> btw did you install the drivers fasttrack raid controller </s>
<s> believe you should do that first then connect the drives believe you ll need to connect both drives to make up the raid and retrieve your data </s>
<s> you said you are running in raid 0 this means the two drives are joined as one continuous drive and would only have one drive letter </s>
<s> as such they cannot operate independently </s>
<s> is it possible you meant they were on raid capable channels on the mb but configured as basic sata </s>
<s> in this case you normally can just connect them to an sata channel of another pc and see if it s recognized and readable </s>
<s> don t try to boot from a bootable partition however if your os is xp </s>
<s> it won t work </s>
