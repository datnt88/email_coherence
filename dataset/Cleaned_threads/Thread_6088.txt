<s> hello i want to buy a new computer and just have a limited budget </s>
<s> so i thought about buying the new intel e4700 with 2gb ram and a hd3850 256mb </s>
<s> i just don t know if the e4700 is really fast enough to run vista in an acceptable speed please tell me your opinion </s>
<s> learn memory management and see what the benchmarks are for other operating systems and by this i mean non windows and non mac </s>
<s> honestly buy it and go for linux gnu or bsd </s>
<s> can you actually afford it and will another processor do the same job </s>
<s> all cpus in the same family have the same cpuflags and will mxecute the same instruction set s </s>
<s> internal speed is more important and if smp isn t readily supported you won t b e getting the performance you want </s>
<s> also remember that 64bit systems cannot run certain applications nwithout a compatibility layer </s>
<s> this is an added comment to the above post </s>
<s> vista can run on single core pcs and the e4700 is as fast as an athlon x2 5000 </s>
