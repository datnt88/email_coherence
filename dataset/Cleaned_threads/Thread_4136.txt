<s> i recently had to purchase a new router to accomodate a fifth computer added to our lan our router only had 4 ports </s>
<s> i know most routers will control other routers attached to it automatically so i added another 4 port router actually all i could find was a 4 port switch is this the same thing </s>
<s> is there any additional security gained from being behind two routers and thus behind two hardware firewalls </s>
<s> unless you disable dhcp on the router not connected to your modem you ll likely lose your internet capabilities </s>
<s> a router and a switch are different in many ways but the key difference is in the way each device manages the packets of information exchanged between computers we will use the term quot hosts quot </s>
<s> a router actually analyzes the quot routing information quot layer 3 of the osi model </s>
<s> many companies have boosted that degree of intelligence to include other services quot built in quot to the magic box such as nat network address translation dhcp dynamic network addressing and plenty of security related features packaged and presented to the owner administrator with a built in web based interface </s>
<s> note if your router includes wireless be sure to read the articles on cnet com regarding securing your wireless router </s>
<s> a switch does not include the intelligence of the router but if you already have a router then a switch is perfect for adding ports </s>
<s> a switch is a quot layer 2 quot in the context of the osi model device and while it does not contain the intelligence of the router it does provide high throughput for the devices that are connected to it kudos to you you got the right box </s>
<s> at home i have a switch connected to a belkin pre n wireless router connected to a linksys vonage voip router connected to my cable company s modem </s>
<s> i also have a lightyear voip router connected to the vonage router and it all works just fine together network printing via konica minolta magicolor color laserjet ethernet printer two ip phones 4 laptops 2 windows desktops 1 linux desktop and an audio video recording studio system </s>
<s> hope i ve helped some woody fairley </s>
<s> well i didn t directly answer your question in my earlier post a switch does not have the intelligence and safeguards built into it to enhance security </s>
<s> if you had purchased another router same brand and model generally speaking it would not enhance security either </s>
<s> a different brand model of router might enhance security generally speaking because it might use a different set of algorithms for the security functions and hacker attacks would have to crack the first router security firewall then discover and crack the second security firewall </s>
<s> honestly with only one router you are pretty safe but i recommend viewing the articles on cnet com regarding securing your home network ok </s>
<s> woody fairley </s>
<s> adding a switch is the best way to add more ports and less headaches </s>
<s> but for more security you can get more firewalls to the pcs and have a router from each of the big makers lined up one behind the other </s>
<s> cool thanks for the tips that cleared my confusion right up </s>
<s> pretty sweet set up you have there by the way </s>
<s> never thought of it that way you could even have multiple routers from the same maker only different model numbers that do not share the same software driver firmware version running in them </s>
<s> imagine the security of 86 firewalls hehe hmmm </s>
<s> is that a single network or is it a different network </s>
<s> i just curious how do you manage the network ip nat dhcp etc </s>
<s> i quote at home i have a switch connected to a belkin pre n wireless router connected to a linksys vonage voip router connected to my cable company s modem </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> i apologize for not replying sooner i ll check the forum more often </s>
<s> my home network is a single network however i have configured the routers to provide back to back firewalls and the voip phones enter the system at different levels between firewalls </s>
<s> nat and dhcp are active at every level but the hosts receive dhcp assignments from the inner most level dhcp server router </s>
<s> it s easier to visualize if i could draw it on a napkin preferrably served with a drink </s>
<s> it s important to change the default settings at every level for security purposes </s>
<s> admin passwords dhcp ranges default gateway addresses ssid s every setting that you can change should be changed but remember to write it all down and keep it filed for when you forget </s>
<s> woody ps i ve added two apple systems to the mix since my last posting </s>
