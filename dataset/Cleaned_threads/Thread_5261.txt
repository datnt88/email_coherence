<s> i have an intel 2 6ghz which is working very well </s>
<s> my temperature is ok but i still want it to be cooler </s>
<s> it is always displaying 42 c and i would like to lower it </s>
<s> i have not oc d it </s>
<s> i know that 42 c isn t a big deal but i would like to have a more efficient fan hs anyway </s>
<s> i have three case fans two exhaust fans in the back and one sucking air into the case on the side of the same </s>
<s> does anyone know about a top of the line fan for my processor in order to keep it even cooler </s>
<s> i want a better fan heatsink not the thermal paste since i think that means that you can t get the hs fan off anymore for top 50 </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> charlie when you remove heat sink to put on a better one with larger fan heat sink the paste isn t a glue </s>
<s> you have to i repeat have to use it to make contact </s>
<s> make sure you remove old and use a quality paste </s>
<s> in the shop i work in i use arctic silver a very thin coating on the heat sink the size of the chip i all thats needed </s>
<s> well if you want to play i doubt that you can go too far wrong with these folks </s>
<s> looks like around 20 bucks </s>
<s> i suspect you will still need the thermal paste </s>
<s> after thought </s>
<s> what happens to cpu temp if you take the fan on the side cover input and turn it around and make it exhaust </s>
<s> a no cost test </s>
<s> but does that mean that the thermal paste doesn t dry </s>
<s> and one more what would be a good quality paste </s>
<s> nope stays pasty artic silver is good but when you buy new heat sink most come with either a tube with paste or heat sink has a pad which is the transfer medium </s>
<s> what do you think about these pastes </s>
<s> anyone that you would recommend </s>
<s> and then i would like to know if this is a good choice thanks again </s>
<s> in my opinion the pastes are pastes i use the cheapy silver have had no probs </s>
<s> and i dont know anything about that heat sink i use a stock amd recomended one for my computer </s>
