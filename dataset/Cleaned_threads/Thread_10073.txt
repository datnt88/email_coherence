<s> i have a tiny piii 55o mhz 256 sdram 100 mhz running win98se i need to replace the motherboard and would like to upgrade to a socket 478 with a 2 4 p4 cpu i have already replaced the cd cd rw on this system and would like to use as much of it as possible i have been looking at several motherboards </s>
<s> some support my sdram and some support ddr my question is in order to use my existing ram do i have to buy a motherboard that supports only sdram 100mhz or can i get one that supports sdram and ddr both including sdram 133 </s>
<s> i am not sure exactly what specs i should look for in order to use as much of my old system as possible </s>
<s> i have a p4 1 9 ghz socket 423 with i845 chipset which i put together because i wanted to recycle some 512 sdram i had </s>
<s> what a mistake </s>
<s> it runs at about the speed of a 900mhz p3 </s>
<s> you may as well just find some 1ghz p3 and get that speed </s>
<s> other issues </s>
<s> your power supply unit psu to run this new dragon should be abotu 400 or more watts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> increasing your processing speed while using pc100 is like buying a ferrari and using regular unleaded </s>
<s> your performance will suffer </s>
<s> if you are going the upgrade route consider adding new ddr compatible with your new board </s>
<s> between a new p4 2 4 533mhz </s>
<s> new board and new ddr at least 256mb you will greatly increase performance </s>
<s> if you can splurg for a sata hard drive that wouldn t hurt either </s>
<s> optical drives floppy sound and video can be recycled for gaming you might want to upgrade the vid but that s another story </s>
