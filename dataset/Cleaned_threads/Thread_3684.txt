<s> i have been doing a littel upgrading on my 2nd older pc </s>
<s> i still play some games on it </s>
<s> already added more memory and was thinking about upgrading the video card </s>
<s> the motherboard only has a 4x agp slot and most cards i m interested in are 8x </s>
<s> if i put in an 8x will i run into any problems </s>
<s> it s a confusing area but if the card plugs in then it s ok bob </s>
<s> and it s not easy to buy a 8x agp card now </s>
<s> newegg com and geeks com but i still prefer cards from this list gt keep in mind the repeating issue i see is not agp motherboard issues but the weakling power supplies </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks everyone </s>
<s> i had the power supply take a crap a while back </s>
<s> i replaced it with a 450w one </s>
<s> as far as agp cards </s>
<s> i have found them all over the place </s>
<s> as long as an 8x cards works in a 4x slot i m good </s>
<s> the market could not support such a card so we never found one </s>
