<s> i would like up upgrade my computer by replacing the motherboard cpu ram and power supply everything else will stay the same </s>
<s> i am ruuning windows vista home premium </s>
<s> my question is will i have to re load windows vista </s>
<s> i upgraded to vista from xp and only have the upgrade dvd and not the full version </s>
<s> the price for the hardware is not an issue but if i have to pay 250 for the full version of vista that then becomes a problem thanks wayne </s>
<s> install xp then vista or install vista and upgrade to vista </s>
<s> both options will work and allow you to continue if you have a full copy of windows xp and not a upgrade version then your good to go </s>
<s> thanks mementh i don t have the full version to either one they are both upgrades that i installed </s>
<s> windows will recognize the new hardware and of course run through the wizards to install but you will likely have to reactivate your copy of windows </s>
<s> i recently moved my xp hardrive from an old machine to a different mainboard cpu ram and psu due to a mainboard failure </s>
<s> xp detected a significant change in hardware and made me reactivate </s>
<s> but that only takes a few moments </s>
<s> its better to reinstall then to use a old install the old drivers could cause issues and its just better in the long run </s>
<s> vista handles low level hardware changes much better than xp </s>
<s> avoiding a complete reinstall when changing mobo drive controllers was one of the goals that it actually met </s>
<s> thanks for your replies to my question </s>
<s> my son just told me that he and my grandkids are buying me the full version of vista ultimate for christmas and beings i won t be doing the upgrade until after the holidays there is no problem now </s>
<s> thanks again wayne </s>
