<s> i just finished putting together my dream computer </s>
<s> i turn it on and everything lights up for a fraction of a second and goes off </s>
<s> i do this a few times and finally it stays on but there s no display from the video card </s>
<s> it seems random whether or not the system will have short quot false starts quot or stay on again with no functionality or display </s>
<s> i ve tried removing everything and reseating everything </s>
<s> is this likely a power supply problem </s>
<s> or the cpu </s>
<s> two separate problems </s>
<s> i m paranoid about cpu damage i feel like i had to press it down pretty hard on it both when i locked the bracket and when i mounted the heatsink </s>
<s> it s a socket 775 with the pins on the socket not the chip </s>
<s> pull the motherboard out of the case yes it s a big pain but you should have done this before installing mb in case put it on a piece of cardboard and try it with nothing but the psu cpu ram video card keyboard and monitor connected </s>
<s> if you can t get it running at this config then clear cmos and last check the cpu installation </s>
<s> once it s running then start connecting the various peripherals one at at time </s>
<s> then retest </s>
<s> once all the components are connected and the system s still running then put it all back in the case </s>
<s> keep us posted </s>
<s> vapcmd vapcmd </s>
<s> check to see if you took plastic cover off back of cpu chip </s>
<s> i almost closed the cover onto it because motherboard instructions don t tell you to remove it while the cpu instructions do the heatsink will be easier to fit too if this is the case </s>
