<s> hi i can t seem to figure this one out </s>
<s> pc specs asus p4s800 motherboard pentium 4 2 8ghz 512mb ddr memory i don t think anything else is relevant </s>
<s> it was a barebones kit </s>
<s> i put everything together back in april i think and everything was working fine </s>
<s> i haven t experienced any problems until recently </s>
<s> suddenly one day the computer would not boot </s>
<s> i would turn it on and it would power up but nothing happened </s>
<s> no beep it would just hang </s>
<s> so i opened it up and started disconecting parts hd cd drives etc one by one </s>
<s> no change </s>
<s> then i started to check connections on everything else video card memory etc and nothing </s>
<s> now for the part that really confusses me </s>
<s> i unlocked the cpu fan to try to take it off </s>
<s> i had difficulty getting it off so i decided to give up reattached the fan and just for kicks turned it on </s>
<s> it booted and went straight to system bios with a message next to cpu external frequency i think </s>
<s> it said something about the setting being too high </s>
<s> i think it was at something like 200 33 </s>
<s> i could be wrong about that value </s>
<s> i have it written down somewhere </s>
<s> anyway there wasn t a lower setting </s>
<s> so i left it alone and exited for the bios and let the pc boot </s>
<s> after this anytime i wanted to use my computer i would have to unlock the cpu fan lock it again then boot </s>
<s> otherwise the system would just hang without booting </s>
<s> also the computer would freeze if i had it on for too long </s>
<s> now it will not boot no matter what i do </s>
<s> could this be a problem with the power supply unit </s>
<s> i thought it might be the processor overheating maybe </s>
<s> i am really lost here and hope someone might be able to help </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> hear much more details about this locking unlocking of the hsf </s>
<s> describe exactly what you are quot unlocking quot and why you can t get the fan off </s>
<s> separating the hsf combo from the cpu should be simple the heat sink compound may cause them to stick together a little but should still be easy to separate </s>
<s> also it is a combination of a heatsink and a fan </s>
<s> are you trying to remove the fan from the heat sink </s>
<s> any chance that you are unlocking the zif connector lever </s>
<s> zero insertion force that allows the cpu to be put in or removed without any insertion force </s>
<s> had a case in the forums where someone was doing that and caused the cpu contacts to get burned due to poor contact because the lever was not locked </s>
<s> well this is going a little beyond my knowledge </s>
<s> i have been learning alot as a result of this problem which is great </s>
<s> anyway i probably could have gotten the fan off but i really didn t know what i was doing and was afraid of accidentally damaging something </s>
<s> there are two levers that lock the fan in place atop the heatsink </s>
<s> all i did was open the levers found the the fan came loose but did not come right off and because i didn t know what i was doing i locked the fan back in place and tried to boot up </s>
<s> even if i did something wrong at that stage it wouldn t explain the initial problem </s>
<s> although it might have made matters worse </s>
<s> i do not think that is the case </s>
<s> i was trying to be very carefull </s>
<s> as for the zif connector lever i am not sure what this looks like </s>
<s> the levers i was touching were about 1 5 inches in length laying horizontally one the top and one on the bottom of the heatsink at least i think they were connected to the heatsink </s>
<s> up until about a week ago i had no idea what a heatsink was </s>
<s> my guess is that you are describing a pentium 4 fan and heat sink </s>
<s> after you loosen the leavers the metal clips have to be moved to remove the fan and heat sink </s>
<s> john </s>
