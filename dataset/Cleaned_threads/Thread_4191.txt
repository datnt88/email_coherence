<s> i have a pentium 4 ht 2 80ghz lga775 pretty much a brand new cpu socket with a pci e card </s>
<s> nvidia 9400gt and i need a new motherboard </s>
<s> i don t want to have to buy all new parts </s>
<s> here is the motherboard in question and i have g skill ddr2 pc2 4200 i was wondering if my ram will work with the motherboard in the link </s>
<s> it seems to be the best board in question for it s price </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> have </s>
<s> there s somewhere between 20 and 40 vapcmd </s>
<s> i have this one i m wanting to find a motherboarc compatible with this cpu my g skill ddr2 pc2 4200 ram with sata and a pci e 16x slot </s>
<s> any ram speed in your case 4200 lower than the motherboard bus speed gt 4200 which happens to be ddr2 667 vs your ddr2 533 is going to create instability lots of crashing is going to happen it s like your ram a souped up car running on a 1 lane street the motherboard which will mean frequent shutdown bsod etc i tried running slower ram on faster bus speed board never realising it until i ve checked the specs of the board minimum bus speed for ram and when i took out the slower ram the system became stable here s the link regarding ram and their bus i o speed so you ll know which ram model to lookout for </s>
<s> that looks like what you might recycle out of your common dell hp or other name desktop </s>
<s> when changing the motherboard from a name brand the os license fails on the new board </s>
<s> is that an issue here </s>

<s> news is the ram required ddr2 800 is faster than what you have and it s inexpensive </s>
<s> get a kit with 2 dimms 1gb each to take advantage of dual channel memory architecture </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> slow ram does not cause memory issues because the motherboard chooses the proper divider </s>
<s> it will autoconfigure itself for any standard speed ddr2 533 ddr2 667 ddr2 800 and some handle ddr2 1066 </s>
<s> slower ram can result in a more stable system since it doesn t push the mch hardware to its limit </s>
<s> this is why many small business servers still come with ddr2 667 as the base memory option </s>
<s> it came out of a dell computer that the motherboard died on </s>
<s> i don t have alot of money and all the ram video card and harddrives were pur chased just last year to upgrade the dell </s>
<s> now i d like to swap over the parts into a new board and in a new case so it s no longer dell </s>
<s> if yours has a dvd drive you could look at windows 7 rc to run until next year for free </s>
<s> but don t count on windows that came with the dell to run </s>
<s> it might it might not and we don t have a leg to stand on to demand a new license </s>

<s> i m just trying to replace the motherboard using the existing parts i have the cpu ram video card hard drive psu etc </s>
<s> all i need is the motherboard i have everything else </s>

<s> my 9400gt 512mb pci e card </s>
<s> that s all i ask </s>
<s> will the motherboard i posted work with it </s>
<s> some may insist this means it s like a car </s>
<s> you change the tire and then get in and drive off </s>
<s> in this case it s not simple </s>
<s> you change the motherboard and while it does work the os will not run </s>
<s> your pc will not work as before </s>
<s> windows is not running </s>
<s> the computer works but will likely need a fresh install of windows but that oem windows may fail </s>
<s> i hope you see the problem </s>

<s> i ve got the disk to fixed that </s>
