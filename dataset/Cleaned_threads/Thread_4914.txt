<s> hello everyone i have a dell optiplex gx270 and it s only a few years old </s>
<s> i recently started getting problems with the monitor usb mouse and usb keyboard shutting off after a normal boot up </s>
<s> it s not always consistant with boot up </s>
<s> sometimes it will happen when running a program </s>
<s> the power light is still on and fan is running when it occurs leaving me to believe it s power supply </s>
<s> i also replaced the motherboard 3v lithium battery after i got the system voltage battery low warning i did have the machine on a surge protector and into the wall electrical outlet hoping that would fix my issue </s>
<s> i still have the same result </s>
<s> please advise if i should replace my power supply or motherboard next </s>
<s> or both </s>
<s> thanks in advance symbolize </s>
<s> sounds like it may be a problem with the connection between your battery and the laptop </s>
<s> if the connector to the battery is on the motherboard then yes motherboard should be changed but definitely sounds like a bad connection somewhere </s>
<s> try to change the power supply with sum1 elses and c if its workin if not then surely u need to change the motherboard or call a technician </s>
