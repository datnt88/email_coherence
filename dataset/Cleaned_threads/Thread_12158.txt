<s> hi everyone </s>
<s> i was wondering if there was a usb dongle that works like a router </s>
<s> that i can plug it into my computer which has a wlan connected and it will become an access point for wifi </s>
<s> basically a router that is as small as a usb flash drive </s>
<s> thanks to those who help </s>
<s> what is your pc currently connected to and how </s>
<s> if you go straight to a modem then you buy a standard wireless router </s>
<s> if you re connected to a wired router you add a wireless access point to that </s>
<s> if you want others to connect through your pc what you d need is a wireless network interface device that can act as an ap and be bridged to your wired nic </s>
<s> in any event i think you re looking for an ap and not a router unless you have some other purpose here </s>
<s> maybe if you could explain more about your plan it would get you a better answer </s>
<s> thank you so much for replying steven haninger </s>
<s> i have a wired connection cable </s>
<s> cable plugged into modem and modem plugged into pc </s>
<s> that s it </s>
<s> i know there are usb flash drive sized wireless adapters that pick up wireless from existing access points </s>
<s> but i would like to know if there s a flash drive sized router </s>
<s> where i can plug it into my wired pc and it will broadcast my internet </s>
<s> i just want an access point made from my wired connection but not with something as big as a router </s>
<s> thanks again for all your help </s>
<s> there is ics which i will no longer write about </s>
<s> too unreliable twitchy to setup so google ics and move on </s>
<s> the honest truth is a router is just as much money as a usb wifi anything </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> but money s not the problem </s>
<s> i just want it to be portable and a snap to set up </s>
<s> i once got such a thing for the wii nintendo system </s>
<s> it s as small as a usb flash drive you simply plug it into a computer that has a wired connection and it will broadcast that connection to become an access point </s>
<s> but it only works for nintendo products </s>
<s> and see if such is out there </s>
<s> what s odd is that a portable wifi router is easy to find </s>
<s> setup is no harder than any router setup </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> quot a portable wifi router is easy to find </s>
<s> setup is no harder than any router setup quot can you point me to one </s>
<s> thanks again for your help </s>
<s> typing in quot portable wifi routers quot </s>
<s> you ll see most are designed for mobile use </s>
<s> but since you said that a standard router was too big are you sure that something the size of a deck of cards would be acceptable but not one as big as a paperback book </s>
<s> is that what s most important to you </s>
<s> otherwise about all i can think is that maybe you insist that your pc be on before the connection even exists </s>
<s> keep in mind that part of what a router does is handle ip addressing on a network and that connecting such to your laptop would create a separate network as well </s>
<s> i also can t see anyway that doing what you re asking isn t going to cripple your laptop in some regard </s>
<s> a wireless router connected to your modem would do all you seem to want if you could find about 40 or so cubic inches of space </s>
<s> dear sirs please link you will find the products usb wifi router which meet your requirments </s>
<s> thanks </s>
