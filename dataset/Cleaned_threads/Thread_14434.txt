<s> hey my friends may call me a geek cos i am really </s>
<s> but it is time to call in the big guns cos this geek can t rectify my situation without some help or some or </s>
<s> so my 500gb maxtor hdd decided it didn t want to play anymore a few days back and i have been trying to recover my data since then </s>
<s> but i think you can guess that i haven t been successful </s>
<s> quot did you back up quot i hear you say scream yell </s>
<s> no i didn t my bad and lesson learnt how we say learned in the uk </s>
<s> but i would still like to try to get my stuff back off the hdd and that is where you come in hopefully </s>
<s> as it stands i now have a 500gb seagate hdd in my pc running windows 7 maxtor hdd had vista </s>
<s> 1 my maxtor drive is spinning up but with clickings noises </s>
<s> it does get recognised by the bios but i clearly can t boot from it </s>
<s> it is only recognised when the machine is turned on i e not on a restart </s>
<s> i have tried different sata ports also </s>
<s> 2 my maxtor drive is also recognised by my device manager and it says that is is functioning correctly </s>
<s> it is also recognised by disk management but there is no letter assigned and it is not initiated </s>
<s> it will not allow initilisation to an i o error </s>
<s> which i imagine is the hdd fault </s>
<s> 3 it is not recognised in my computer or in dos </s>
<s> so can t try fdisk or scan </s>
<s> 4 downloaded seagate tools now owns maxtor and it also recognises the drive but can t diagnose it but does offer a firmware update </s>
<s> 5 i have tried the following see if the hdd is recognised in knoppix or ubuntu it isn t </s>
<s> and i have tried the following programs stellar phoenix windows data recovery ubcd4win pc inspector file recovery getdataback for ntfs pc inspector samrt recovery arcronis disk director file scavenger 3 2 find and mount hdd regenerator kroll ontrack easyrecovery o o disk recovery recover my files v4 r studio and spinrite v6 0 only a couple of these were able to recognise the drive including pc inspector file recovery but couldn t access the drive </s>
<s> 6 i have also tried freezing the hdd and then attaching it </s>
<s> the rather frustrating thing is that the hdd is still semi working and being semi recognised so i don t quite follow why any of these programs can t pick it up or the other oss that i have tried </s>
<s> if it wasn t spinning or wasn t being recognised at all i would probably capitulate but i know that someone must have the answer </s>
<s> can you help </s>
<s> thanks matt </s>
<s> that won t be cheap however </s>
<s> we generally recommend kees </s>
<s> unless you have super critical data on the hd consider this a lost cause for the end user </s>
<s> the quot clicking noise quot is a sure sign the hd is faulty in a h w way or plain broken </s>
<s> as already posted to you call the pros if you need that data </s>
<s> otherwise find another hd and reload and start over again </s>
<s> you could have lessen the impact of losing the data if you quot back up quot i hope its a lesson learned once </s>
<s> last don t buy a maxtor hd enuf said </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> at the top of the forum the usual diy titles are noted </s>
<s> try the demo of getdataback just for that last change then we are looking at you saw you tried other sata ports but try another sata power plug too </s>
