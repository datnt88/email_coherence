<s> recently my laptop stopped charging </s>
<s> i believe it has to do with the dc jack having s bad connection since before it completely stopped working it would get really hot </s>
<s> i ve opened the back panel of my laptop and can see that the dc jack wiggles a little in its socket </s>
<s> do you guys think resoldering it to the motherboard would fix the issue </s>
<s> if you don t do solder work then your choice for this to be your first </s>
<s> if you do such work then why not </s>
<s> frankly at a few dollars i suggest you replace the jack </s>
<s> google this gt laptop jack repair lt bob </s>
<s> inside that little plastic connector for the external adapter is a small switch that selects the power source </s>
<s> either adapter of battery </s>
<s> this jack gets jammed yanked and pulled six ways at once </s>
<s> it s not uncommon for the connector to work loose pull up traces create cold solder joints and burn things up </s>
<s> after repeated repairs from repeated abuse i just put the connector on a pig tail that hangs through the hole </s>
<s> this keeps that connector area free from stress and can patch around a damaged pcb to salvage an otherwise junked unit </s>
<s> an inspection is certainly called for </s>
<s> since you can look at the dc connection internally be sure what s what </s>
<s> solder being loose or contacts are wiggle able should be soldered </s>
<s> however many times a minor crack is present on the pcb board so be sure all is well </s>
<s> you can even re enforce it abit by placing a short piece of wire to hold more solder and thus brace it up provided that can be done at all </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
