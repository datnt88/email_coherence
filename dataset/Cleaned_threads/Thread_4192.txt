<s> imac g4 flat panel os 10 4 11 my imac keeps recognizing one ext fw hd but not my iomega ext fw hd </s>
<s> both are journaled </s>
<s> startup disk selection in prefs does not recognize the iomage hd yet i see it on my desktop </s>
<s> whazzup </s>
<s> how to keep the imega hd as my startup disk </s>
<s> why do you need it as the startup drive </s>
<s> along with the mac os x journaled make sure that the thing is set to guid partion table </s>
<s> if it is not it will not be recognized as a legitimate startup disk p </s>
<s> techtool pro tells me the int hd only 80 is failing the io hd is 250 only 8 mos old </s>
<s> so i figured the io hd could hold every thing with room to spare </s>
<s> where do i go to set to guid partition table </s>
<s> how to do </s>
<s> and erase that iomega drive </s>
<s> then partition it into one partion </s>
<s> click the customize button and choose apple as the partition type </s>
<s> proceed from there </s>

<s> solved my problem ppc macs will not boot from usb ext hd only fw </s>
<s> i goofed on titling this thread my iomega hd is ext usb </s>
<s> anyone selling an ext fw hd for a g4 </s>
<s> should be hundreds of choices today </s>
<s> but if i had that iomega i might pull the hard drive out of it and see if it fits in some enclosure like </s>
<s> platform specific </s>
<s> a fw hd will work on a pc or a mac as will a usb drive or a sata drive p </s>
<s> usb 2 0 has max transfer rate of 480 mbits s ieee 1394b 2002 has 786 4 mbits s </s>
<s> wouldn t iomega or wd use slower drives for usb 2 0 external drives than they do for firewire 800 external drives to minimize costs </s>
<s> what would happen if i put a slower sata drive inside the firewire 800 external drive enclosure </s>
<s> does it still work except for slower transfer or my mac won t mount the drive on its firewire 800 port </s>
<s> i m interested because i m looking for a fast firewire 800 external drive to make periodic bootable backups of the boot disk on my macbook pro </s>
<s> i think i need about 500gb to keep the most recent 2 3 bootable backups of my 200gb boot drive on my mac to recover from disk crash or system hang </s>
<s> i already use an iomega ego 1tb mac edition for time machine backups </s>
<s> is it wise to assemble my own firewire 800 external storage or buy one off the shelf </s>
<s> my problem is mfgr s like iomega and wd don t give you enough details of the hard disk inside the box to compare </s>
<s> i m a computer hardware professional in a past life but is not sure how to make sense of the info published by hard drive manufacturers </s>
<s> any recommendations for a refresher or tutorial </s>
<s> i find many to get uppity as they begin the learning process that transfer rate over the wire is not any indication of the overall speed of the transfer </s>
<s> yes 800 should result in lower times but in my experience it never cut a 10 second transfer down to 5 seconds </s>
<s> as to the slower sata drive that s easy </s>
<s> even sata 1 5gbs is faster than 800 so you should not see any measurable change from sata 3gbs to that </s>
<s> yes the drive seek time changes have more of an impact but you knew that </s>
<s> as to the tutorial i suggest you keep reading and reading and after a few months it will start to make sense </s>
<s> i like our classes when we read about amdahl s laws and think it applies here </s>
<s> this and thinking about this like the slowest link in the chain sets the speed </s>
<s> however the read and write speeds of drives are far lower than the transfer rate of the interfaces </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes you re right </s>
<s> thanks for pointing out that these external storage all use sata drives </s>
<s> unless i have an esata port on my mac i m getting way too cerebral here and would be wasting my money on the faster drives </s>
