<s> i have checked with the epson website and managed to get the printer working but they do not have a scanner photocopier driver for windows 7 is there any way i can get these functions to work on this printer </s>
<s> i am using an acer 5635z 64bit laptop </s>
<s> epson com wrote quot download and install the windows vista version of epson scan from the epson website quot for the scanner in windows 7 did you try that </s>
<s> claims their scanner software works but do drop them a line </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no epson s suggestion using the one for vista won t install </s>
<s> vuescan seems very impressive but the free test one has dollar signs over the result </s>
<s> the usable one costs 39 </s>
<s> question is it worth spending this on an old printer or do i buy a new one </s>
<s> vuescan used to offer a demo mode so you could test it </s>
<s> ask them for that or just try it </s>
<s> i can t tell if you feel if this scanner is worth it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob it is the demo where you finish up with dollar watermarks over the result </s>
<s> no i know you can t make up my mind for me </s>
<s> it was a kinda rhetorical question </s>
<s> at least you can give it a test before you decide </s>
<s> can i share an observation here </s>
<s> a few get upset over the lack of drivers as the years roll by </s>
<s> while i can explain why this is so what i want to write is this gt many get so upset they write quot i ll never buy from them again quot here s my observation </s>
<s> this issue is not limited to just a few makers </s>
<s> i ve seen this happen with every product over the years from each maker </s>
<s> however i have had good luck with windows 7 xp mode where i use an old outdated no driver will ever be found usb microscope </s>
<s> this device has been very nice to capture pictures of stuff i need to document </s>
<s> it would be a shame to work that hard and for some there is that cost to upgrade to windows 7 pro or higher so vuescan is likely the cheap exit unless there is a new all in one that is cheaper than vuescan </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but i am not eligible to download windows xp mode with windows 7 home premium </s>
<s> vuescan seems very good but i must weigh this against the cost of a brand new printer scanner for about 50 you are right about about the compatibility cost of windows 7 i lost adobe photoshop corel draw videocam look greeting card magic and canon zoom browser does not link to pictures </s>
<s> all these were working well on xp so i seem to be paying the price of getting up to date </s>
<s> the cost of that is to upgrade to 7 pro </s>
<s> then you gain access to xp mode and those old softwares can run in xp mode </s>
<s> maybe that would be worth it </s>
<s> it takes a little learning to master it but i find it to be a great solution </s>
