<s> thanks </s>
<s> if you must use ics and the crossover you need to set ics to use a different ip address range than the router such as 198 168 1 xxx </s>
<s> however you could save yourself all kinds of headaches if you simply got another wireless adapter for the other computer </s>

<s> within the same network segment is an exercise in futility </s>
<s> use another wireless device and ditch ics </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> well just to follow up on what i did in the end i moved the wireless router and got an cat5 extention so the second computer and the xbox were wired while the first computer recieved internet wirelessly </s>
