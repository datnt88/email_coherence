<s> i know this should be simple but i have a user that is having problems with her printer when she prints anything the paper come out curled up </s>
<s> she happens to be the office manager i cant think of anything that would cause that before i check it out i would like to have some ideas help quick thanks </s>
<s> two reasons for paper curling tension and heat </s>
<s> due to humidity and or environment paper is prone to curl to its weak side </s>
<s> its the way the paper ream was cut </s>
<s> leave a sheet of paper by a sunny window and show it start to curl overtime </s>
<s> as for tension when going through the paper path the bends and curves will cause this </s>
<s> under heat more so like in laser printing </s>
<s> cheap paper too is prone to this condition </s>
<s> again on tension if possible use the straight paper path if available some models do </s>
<s> the tension rollers keep the paper firm in its paper path but under wear tear will lessen over time </s>
<s> any correction may cause less curling but over time will cause jamming crimps kinks or off shrew as the paper isn t flat as can be </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> but i would like to add another thought </s>
<s> inkjet ink especially in large amounts has also been cited as a cause of paper curl </s>
<s> a text page which may have perhaps 10 ink will not curl the same as as a photo page which may have 90 ink coverage </s>
<s> also the kind of paper and the kind of ink used come into play </s>
<s> there are papers made specifically for laser printers papers made specifically for inkjets and compromise quot all purpose quot papers </s>
<s> inkjet papers also have a quot photo paper quot category and there are sometimes special inks for these papers </s>
<s> while these things primarily affect image quality they might also affect curl </s>
<s> and btw paper does have quot sides quot the side toward the top of the package is always the quot better quot printing side </s>
<s> the brand grade and weight thickiness of the paper could also be factors </s>
<s> i suggest that you check the printer manufacturer s recommendations and if the problem is serious enough try different papers and inks to find the best combination </s>
<s> hope this helps a little frank </s>
<s> but the reason was the feeder </s>
<s> we had a tech come in and had it replaced </s>
<s> but thanks for the help </s>
