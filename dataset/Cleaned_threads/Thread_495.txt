<s> here take a look at this motherboard i don t get it two pci slots are in between the two pci e x16 slots </s>
<s> how will you be able to use the pci slots if you have 2 gpus in sli if the the sli bridge will obstruct the access installation of the pci slots </s>
<s> or is it that this board does not require the sli bridge at all </s>
<s> 1 you lose the use of a pci slot for every pci express x16 card inserted </s>
<s> 2 worst case scenario is that if you go with 2 video cards in sli you will be left with one pci slot and one pci e x4 slot </s>
<s> this usually is not a problem for sli gamers who really only need pci for a good sound card </s>
<s> everything else excpet maybe a dial up modem is integrated into the motherboard </s>
<s> if you need more expandability use the pci e x4 slot or external hardware via usb or firewire </s>
<s> the board comes with a quot soft quot sli bridge cable that allows you to have a pci card between the vid cards </s>
<s> when you use sli on the asus a8n sli premium you don t lose pci slots </s>
<s> definitely worth it if you must have the most sli bandwidth </s>
<s> any motherboard with an quot nvidia nforce4 sli quot chipset runs the two video cards in sli at 8x speeds </s>
<s> this is the a8n sli premium motherboard </s>
<s> the quot nvidia nforce4 sli x16 quot chipset motherboards can run both cards at x16 speeds </s>
<s> so the a8n32 sli deluxe can have twice the bandwidth in sli </s>
<s> whoah </s>
<s> with regard to losing expansion slots you will lose one pci slot and one pci e x1 slot on the a8n sli premium if you add beefy video cards or wish to have decent video cooling </s>
<s> the way i see it it s pretty much a wash between the two boards with respect to losing expansion slots </s>
<s> imo pci slots are important but not as critical as they used to be for the typical computer user because dual ethernet hd controllers sound usb 2 0 firewire and other capabilities are integrated into the motherboard </s>
<s> as always every individual s needs are different </s>
<s> if you need many expansion slots by all means go with the motherboard with the lesser chipset </s>
<s> they are both good </s>
<s> 1 for sound card and basically it unless maybe some kind of fan control raid adapter etc </s>
<s> but most likely only need max of 2 pci slots </s>
<s> and i read that it is pointless now since no game out there takes advantage of quot true dual x16 slots quot </s>
<s> dual x8 slots are fine now and provide excellent sli performance at the highest resolutions </s>
<s> i also realized that the 32 delux does not come with onboard firewire which imo sucks </s>
<s> i know that you lose pci slots when doing sli but the 32 delux is too expensive you only have one pci slot after sli and i am reading reviews that it is way too buggy right now </s>
<s> you get no onboard firewire and one pci slot for expansion </s>
<s> personally i can t justify the cost for my uses not a high end gamer </s>
<s> i usually don t consider purchasing such items until there are more models with the new chipset prices drop and bugs are worked out however i did notice that many of its bad reviews seem to come from consumers with less hardware experience </s>
<s> test labs have had success </s>
<s> it definitely is not a novice board </s>
<s> 245 is outrageous for a motherboard </s>
<s> i m not a gamer but i am curious </s>
<s> maybe in the future i ll try an sli setup </s>
<s> i have always wanted to build a super high end system for some reason but i am going to wait until prices drop and newer boards come out with the dual x16 slots </s>
<s> i read a customer review of the board where the guy had to tweak stuff in the bios to get it working properly the customer specially mentioned it is not a novice board </s>
<s> i going to wait and let the competiton fight each other </s>
