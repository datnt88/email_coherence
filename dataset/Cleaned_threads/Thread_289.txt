<s> the 2 desktops have been networked for a long time now </s>
<s> i am trying to add a laptop wirelessly to share files and a printer computer a dell can not find the laptop on the network but can find the other desktop computer b computer b gateway can find both laptop and computer a but when i click on laptop it says laptopname is not accessible </s>
<s> laptop can not find any of the other two computers </s>
<s> when i click on the network name it says that network is inaccessible i have disabled all the firewalls </s>
<s> in fact when i started trying to set this up the laptop didn t have any virus scan at the time </s>
<s> computer a has avg free on it as does the laptop now </s>
<s> did not find any sign of a firewall with that virus scan </s>
<s> all computers have guest account as active </s>
<s> all computers have a folder set as having permission to be shared </s>
<s> all computers can ping each other using their ip addresses </s>
<s> i m stumped </s>
<s> i don t know what to do </s>
<s> i don t know how i got computer b to find the laptop but it can t access it anyways </s>
<s> please help and thanks in advance </s>
<s> tracy </s>
<s> presumably you are fighting your way through xp s add a network place enigma </s>
<s> sometimes it works instantly even without the complete computer name sometimes it just refuses to work unless everything is just so </s>
<s> how microsoft imagined that the average consumer could use this is beyond me </s>
<s> i would suggest that you check that all firewalls are off especially if your have 3rd party ones </s>
<s> don t attempt to set up wirelessly use ethernet cable between the computers until things are working </s>
<s> try running the network wizard on the new machine </s>
<s> other than that just stick at it and eventually it will work </s>
<s> didn t see any mention of this in your post but have you checked that the laptop belongs to the same workgroup as your two desktops </s>
<s> right click my computer gt properties gt computer name tab </s>
<s> thanks for the help guys but i actually got it </s>
<s> i had to install the nwlink ipxspxnetbios compatible transport protocol on the laptop </s>
<s> as soon as i did that they all found each other and they were all able to quot talk quot to each other </s>
<s> once i found that it took me 10 seconds to fix it </s>
<s> pretty frustrating when it is something that simple and i was looking for the answer for a week but at least it s fixed and so far it seems to be working well </s>
<s> thanks again tracy </s>
