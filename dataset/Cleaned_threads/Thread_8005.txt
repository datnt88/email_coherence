<s> the new article with a sneek peak of windows longhorn has made me much less stressed out </s>
<s> someone said you would need like 4gb of ram to run it well and you would also have to have a 64 bit processor </s>
<s> well not only does the article mention it will need quot at least 512mb of ram quot but it also says it comes in a 64 bit and 32 bit versions </s>
<s> i think that because longhorn will also have 32 bit version 64 bit will become the standard at a much later time then most people were expecting </s>
<s> i m just very thankful that m didnt just go all out and make a os that needs a 2 000 computer to run </s>
<s> longhorn will require more than 512mb of ram </s>
<s> i have never had quot any quot version of windows run smoothly with the minimum recommended ram </s>
<s> i think ms must base their calculations on the premise that windows will be the quot only quot program installed on your computer </s>
<s> jdm btw the people i ve talked to about longhorn say that most of the good stuff will be under the hood </s>
<s> that s nice to know but it will be a tough sell for ms people like what they can see </s>
<s> its like windows xp it says it can run on 128mb of ram but you should probobly have 256mb </s>
<s> so in this case it probobly means you should have 1gb which is much more do able then 4gb </s>
<s> what do you mean by under the hood </s>
<s> does that mean just over all better performance </s>
<s> oh and the artice mentions you need a good gpu </s>
<s> do you think it would turn off all the extra effects while you are playing a game </s>
<s> its bad enough that windows wastes a lot of your processing power when playing a game it would really suck if windoes also started watering down your gpu </s>
<s> and quot better written quot software is what i ve been told </s>
<s> my contacts say it s going to be a great new quot framework quot for doing bigger and better things </s>
<s> their verdict is quot awesome quot and they are really picky guys </s>
<s> knowing them they re impressed by things like quot stability quot quot efficiency quot quot security quot quot expansion capacity quot etc </s>
<s> i m not a programmer so i don t understand exactly what it is that has them so excited but they are quite excited </s>
<s> from what i know once you ve installed the software it won t be easy to enable disable the enhanced graphical features </s>
<s> that will be more of an quot initial setup quot issue </s>
<s> i would assume however that those features wouldn t really interfere with game play </s>
<s> jdm </s>
<s> lets see now longhorn is not in a beta yet over a year away </s>
<s> don t hold your braeth </s>
<s> lets review some history </s>
<s> windows 95 hype for 3 years </s>
<s> befor it came out </s>
<s> many probles with the product </s>
<s> then win98 didn t work good untill second edition in 99 then winme to many problems to go into </s>
<s> win xp now on sp2 still lots of problems </s>
<s> ms has had to take so much out of longhorn that it should be called shorthorn </s>
<s> there is an old saying quot the proof of the pudding is in the eating quot </s>
<s> right now ms is selling sizzle but there is no steak </s>
<s> i look a longhorn maybe when it gets to sp1 </s>
