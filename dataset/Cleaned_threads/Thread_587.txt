<s> hi there can someone point me in the right direction of a web site that shows how to test a atx psu ie what voltages etc should be coming out of what leads etc </s>
<s> i realize it should be under load conditons mobo and at least one hard drive but the rest i have no idea </s>
<s> so your informed help would be greatly apreciated </s>
<s> kindest regards tony b </s>
<s> shows a test rig for testing a power supply </s>
<s> such are rarely needed for most of us </s>
<s> in fact a new power supply with watts to spare will cost much less than testing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> osha will hate you </s>
<s> lol you can probe the rear of the power connector on the mobo </s>
<s> the black leads are all common ground in most peoples terms </s>
<s> the main 5 volts is on pins 4 6 19 and 20 the main once 12 volts is on pin 10 now there is also a separate 4 pin 12 volt connector 2 pins 12 v and 2 gnd it is now spec d to be provided by a separate set of rails in the supply </s>
<s> the 3 3v is on pins 1 2 and 11 the pins run from 1 thru 10 down one side and 11 next to 1 thru 20 down the other side </s>
<s> the 11 thru 20 side has 4 black wires the other row only 3 black wires </s>
<s> 5 volts are virtually always red </s>
<s> minus 12 and minus 5 volts are virtually no longer used </s>
<s> testing an atx standalone means you have to learn how to turn the supply outputs on </s>
<s> robert s link probably shows that </s>
<s> i chuckle over some stories </s>
<s> why do you need to test it </s>
<s> pwr supply fan runs 12 good </s>
<s> processor fan and other fans 12 good </s>
<s> hdd spins cdrom drive opens 5 good </s>
<s> need meter harbor freight 5 for 5 12 3 3 which i have found burnt out a few times because the current rating is small </s>
<s> is a link to describe the voltages of typical atx supply </s>
<s> do with a voltage scale </s>
<s> they draw virtually zero current </s>
<s> that s the point of a voltmeter </s>
<s> the old d arsonvals were usually 10 000 ohms per volt </s>
<s> modern digital are multimegohm </s>
<s> meter burnouts occur when one tries to measure 120 vac when on an ohms scale does it every time </s>
<s> just a thank you to all who have contirbuted to this discussion </s>
<s> regards tony b </s>
<s> 12 5 are rated at about 300 400ma while other voltages are rated 5a 20a </s>
<s> the point being that the minus voltages can be easily burnt out </s>
<s> i don t think they have the same interupt as the voltages do </s>
<s> short out the 5v and the pwr supp will restart instead of burn out </s>
<s> lightening or other way excessive surges can more easily burn out voltages as has been my experience </s>
