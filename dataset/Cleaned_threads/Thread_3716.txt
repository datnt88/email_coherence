<s> the samsung 17 inch lcd monitor 710n 2 black is selling for such low prices at newegg and others 309 minus 30 mail in and minus 40 immediate rebate 239 incl shipping </s>
<s> this is a 12 millisecond model </s>
<s> i heard that some of the faster ones didn t match up when it came to color quality </s>
<s> do you think that samsung is unloading them </s>
<s> i saw newegg promoting it just earlier this morning as well </s>
<s> i bet samsung is definitely trying to unload them </s>
<s> i purchased the samsung 710n 2 from zipzoomfly and received an older model quot samsung 710n quot no 2 and the box came without any upc code for rebate </s>
<s> i am currently in the middle of trying to rectify this situation with zipzoomfly samsung </s>
<s> beware of dealing with them as you may end up with something you did not want </s>
