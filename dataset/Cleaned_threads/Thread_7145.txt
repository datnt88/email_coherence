<s> i m having a horrible problem with my iomega usb cd burner zip cd 650 and it s become a big mystery for me </s>
<s> i ve had the burner since april and it s always worked perfectly well but a couple weeks ago my cd burner stopped burning disks </s>
<s> in fact whenever i had it connected to the computer the computer would freeze </s>
<s> the green power light flashes while it s just sitting there not being used </s>
<s> i consulted with the online help at iomega com and he suggested that the power source was probably going bad </s>
<s> it would cost 15 to replace </s>
<s> so i bought another used iomega zip cd 650 exact same model as i had before on ebay for 17 50 i figured that way i would have another drive in case the power source turned out to not be the problem </s>
<s> the new to me power source initially seemed to work just fine and i successfully burned nine cds within a couple of days </s>
<s> then the drive started having problems again and it started making this intermittent clicking noise and the green power light again started flashing and disappearing again while it s just sitting there not being used with no cd in it </s>
<s> so i switched the old drive out for the one i bought on ebay </s>
<s> this seemed to work and i successfully burned two more cds </s>
<s> now the new to me used really drive is doing the exact same thing </s>
<s> then i thought maybe the problem was with the usb cable and i switched it with a different one </s>
<s> no help </s>
<s> i also i tried re installing the driver </s>
<s> now the newer drive is causing my computer to freeze when it s connected to my computer just like the old one did </s>
<s> but it s a completely different drive power source and usb cable </s>
<s> what are the chances that this drive has the exact same problem as the old one </s>
<s> and how might it be fixed </s>
<s> i m going nuts here </s>
<s> i need this cd burner </s>
<s> i use it all the time for work or at least i used to </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> i checked out a site called the quot unofficial iomega click of death quot and found a couple cases when people thought it might happen with the cd burners too </s>
<s> could this be the problem </s>
<s> with both of them </s>
<s> i am on an imac 333 mhz 96 mb ram os 9 1 the burning software i m using is adaptec toast </s>
<s> thanks for any help anyone can give me </s>
<s> that s for the zip 100 drives </s>
<s> what s the date of manufacture on those drives </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for responding </s>
<s> i was hoping it wasn t the cod </s>
<s> but some people on that site i mentioned described having clicking problems with the zip cd 650 that preceded its death so i was concerned </s>
<s> not sure exactly when these cd rws were released </s>
<s> i think it was 2000 or 2001 the little bugger is sitting there clicking at me as i type </s>
<s> sigh </s>
<s> the drive is not supposed to click so maybe they designed it in since it was so popular with the zip 100 </s>
<s> ducking bob </s>
<s> not funny cries so ah no helpful suggestions then </s>
<s> oy </s>
<s> glares at </s>
<s> cd burner </s>
<s> the case has been known to be re usable </s>
<s> you remove their failed cdrw drive and stick in a new ide cdrw drive </s>
<s> from 10 to 20 bucks </s>
