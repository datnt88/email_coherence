<s> does anyone know if there is a way to enable the usb port of a tv to access video files held on a nas drive </s>
<s> my aim is to access the drive via wifi or ethernet </s>
<s> presumably it would need to present the drive as a mass storage device to the tv s usb port since that s basically what the port picks up </s>
<s> any suggestions would be most welcome </s>
<s> the tv does not support dlna and i m trying to avoid having to buy a separate media player e g </s>
<s> wd live tv box </s>
<s> lt div gt lt div gt </s>
<s> this sounds like the fellow i met yesterday that wanted to make cellular phone calls without a cell phone </s>
<s> rather than upset him i just nodded a lot </s>
<s> for you my nod is to the logitech revue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i hear what you re saying but the budget won t stretch that far </s>
<s> is there any kit which might achieve what i m looking for </s>
<s> i imagine others will have considered this as it would seem to be an obvious solution to centrally accessing media files for viewing on the telly </s>
<s> a lot of modern tvs have pretty good built in media players </s>
<s> but is it possible </s>
<s> because such needs some little computer in a box like the revue and such and that i limit explanations to 3 or less paragraphs let s go with this </s>
<s> gt what have you found that does what you want for your price </s>
<s> if nothing then what happens if you try the 99 buck price </s>
<s> and wait wait don t tell me about the roku stick at bob </s>
<s> i was just hoping there might be a cheap and simple piece of kit which might achieve what i m after </s>
<s> i ve done some research and haven t found anything hence my question </s>
<s> i realise that if it ends up costing the same as a media streaming box then it would be pointless </s>
<s> has anyone found a set up which does this simply and cheaply </s>
<s> i ve seen the older roku refurbs on woot com for 49 bucks </s>
<s> but i had that and gave it to my brother and now have the logitech revue which is now 99 bucks </s>
<s> there is a zero cost solution you may have already </s>
<s> hook up your pc to the tv and you are done </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i suspect that might be the only realistic option </s>
<s> there are 2 devices which do exactly what i m looking for the first is reported to be the better device and they re not that cheap so it s questionable whether these would be worth the money over a network dnla type media player </s>
<s> and less capable </s>
<s> good luck and tell us how it turns out </s>
<s> today it looks like you can get both units for 89 95 </s>
