<s> hi i recently bought a 2tb external drive seagate everthing is fine except a small issue when i access the hard drive or using any files on it it is ok if it is left idle for some time say 5 10mins or no files on the drive are being used the hard drive turns off and few secs later turns on and i get the autoplay options is there any way to get over this </s>
<s> first check your windows power settings in control panel that could be the issue </s>
<s> if not it may be a setting in the external drive software sounds like one or the other </s>
<s> but if i read page 9 of it looks like you can change it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks a lot for the help </s>
<s> thank u for the advise </s>
