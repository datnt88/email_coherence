<s> i am planning on a home wireless network for the first time and wondering about purchasing b or g devices </s>
<s> it would be for two desktop computers and maybe a laptop sharing a dsl connection </s>
<s> some of the b stuff i have found is quite cheap and i don t think i need the faster speeds of g are there other benefits to a g network that i should consider </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> around here the g equipment is within 1 dollar of the b equipment </s>
<s> in a nutshell b goes 11 megabit per second and g might get 54 for 1 dollar i d get the g equipment </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks i appreciate it </s>
<s> doing some price comparisons clearl backs you up i can find a very cheap b router but not a cheap b pci wireless card the total is about the same for a g set up </s>
<s> as bob points out the prices are close </s>
<s> although the b speed is sufficient for simple dsl connectivity you will find it dragging when transferring large files between computers and just plain inadequate when playing a high quality music or video file that resides on the other computer pauses and dropouts </s>
<s> the g equipment will be robust enough for that </s>
<s> since the price differences are not material don t box yourself into unsatisfactory performance with the slower b equipment </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> thanks for your comments </s>
<s> there are some benefits to using g over b the speed issue you know about and while it won t boost your internet connection much since i doubt you have an 11mbps connection no matter how broad your bandwidth is it would facilitate faster file sharing between the machines on the network a plus </s>
<s> some g equipment is equipped with wpa a stronger encryption protocol than wep another plus and you will want to encrypt your network if you don t know why read some recent articles in cnet on the subject </s>
<s> lastly any g hardware will work on a b network like if the notebook goes down to a local cafe with wireless service but b hardware won t work on a g network </s>
<s> in a problem like this i would plan ahead </s>
<s> what will you eb doing in the future </s>
<s> thiknig of upgrading to a fast broadband connection ever </s>
<s> in which case the 812 11g will be needed </s>
<s> also anything for 812 11 is compatable with 802 11g </s>
<s> my advice would be to get a g network and use b equipment on it until you need to upgrade to g equipment when you need the speed </s>
<s> if you do alot of large file transfers between the pc s on your wireless network go with g if your just gonna use the internet with different computers b is the cost effective solution and you won t notice any difference anyways </s>
<s> also g is backwards compatible with b so you can mix and match the cheapest parts but you would be limited to b s transmission speed of 11mbps </s>
<s> if you don t need the speed of the g then stick with the b </s>
<s> it s slower but also a liitle more secure then g </s>
<s> b 11mb transfer rate g 54mb transfer rate </s>
<s> in response to your saying g will run on a b but b hardware won t work on a g network </s>
<s> that s not true </s>
<s> b will run on a g network but only at b speed 11mb </s>
<s> hi </s>
<s> i used b myself for a project last year </s>
<s> i did not find that g would give me any other significant benefits </s>
<s> however i would suggest that before you buy any equipment you check the range they provide for </s>
<s> especially if you use an access point </s>
<s> make sure you check that the signal strength supported by the cards and the access point covers the distance that you intend to use it over </s>
<s> also keep in mind that the g version is going to become more and more popular from now on whereas b may soon be fogotten i personally don t think that will happen too soon </s>
<s> if you want to go into the technical details of the issue g uses a wider frequency band but the same modulation technique as b g actually reaches the same speeds as version a but there is also version e that s under construction </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
