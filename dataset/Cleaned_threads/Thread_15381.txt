<s> when i turn this computer one it just does one long beep over and over and over i was wondering what this ment </s>
<s> it wont boot up at all </s>
<s> look here </s>
<s> is that the bios has notified you of a fatal hardware error </s>
<s> this could be ram processor or video </s>
<s> it could just be a poor connection such as an unseated component </s>
<s> agp video cards are notorious for this because of the construction of the card edge and mb slot </s>
<s> they tend to creep with pressure from tightening screws and the cable </s>
<s> such is probably why newer versions are locked in place </s>
<s> take everything apart and reseat it </s>
<s> try disconnecting what is not vital and try again </s>
<s> this might help to disclose a weak power supply </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> ok well we tryed pulling stuff out like 1 think then another and the only time it dident do the long beep is when the processor was out of it </s>
<s> i m guessing that means the processer is broke </s>
