<s> hi i can t seem to access the net when transferring large files between my desktop winxp sp3 100mbps net card and my laptop win7 54mbps wifi </s>
<s> i have an edimax br 6228nc 150 mbps broadband router to which my desktop is wired and the laptop connects through wifi </s>
<s> the speeds never go above 2 5mbps so there should be plenty of bandwidth left for internet use </s>
<s> my router config confirms that there s no internet connection while transferring the files </s>
<s> can anyone please help me with this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i had a similar problem when transferring large files but i would lose all connectivity and the router would reset itself </s>
<s> i tried every possible solution before giving up and buying a different make model router </s>
<s> i haven t had a problem since then </s>
<s> does the router have the latest firmware installed </s>
<s> have you tried a factory reset </s>
<s> do you have the same problem when both computers are wired to the router </s>
<s> since i don t have the full picture of router and more settings i suggest you try router and such defaults first along with a channel check </s>
<s> what s that </s>
<s> read this recent discussion </s>
