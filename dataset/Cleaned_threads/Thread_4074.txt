<s> all capital letters are too hard to read </s>
<s> for 3 to 5 year games you best use a machine from that time </s>
<s> an intel 2 8ghz dual core should be fine with 1 or 2gb ram and a newer video card </s>
<s> i think this dell has a pcie slot so let me offer a card i would use gt this moves the video card up to game play standards without having to replace the computer s power supply </s>
<s> be sure to see if the card mechanically fits </s>
