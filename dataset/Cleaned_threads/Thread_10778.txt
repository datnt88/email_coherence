<s> i was hoping someone could give me some advice on upgrading memory </s>
<s> i hate to ask what might be a basic question but i also don t want to either buy the incorrect or best option for memory </s>
<s> i am looking to upgrade my pc to i think 4gb of ram </s>
<s> i currently have a hp m7248n with 1 mb of ram </s>
<s> more specifically acording to the stats i have 2 x 512 184 pin ddr sdram </s>
<s> the pc has a athlon 64 x2 m 4200 2 2 ghz processor and i am running windows xp media center edition ver 2002 service pack 2 i also believe i have 4 slots for memory 2 in use 2 available </s>
<s> i have included a link to the hp web site with my model below if i left out any additional information </s>
<s> in regards to use i am not a huge power user except for the fact i burn a lot of dvds of home movies </s>
<s> also burn cd s listen to music transfer songs to mp3 </s>
<s> i also do a lot of uploading photos etc </s>
<s> dad of 3 kids basically </s>
<s> i don t do gaming really at all so beyond the power intensive dvd rendering and other items above my use ends up mainly limited to internet etc </s>
<s> here are my questions 1 right off the bat what kind of memory should i get </s>
<s> when i did a quick look i saw options such as 800 mhz ddr2 1333 mhz ddr3 etc </s>
<s> i know what memory is in general but get lost on the ddr2 vs ddr3 etc 2 if i have 4 slots open and am interested in 4 gb can i actually buy 2 2 gb cards and keep my existing 2 and actually end up with 5 gb </s>
<s> or am i better off yanking what i have and just putting in the 2 2 gb or maybe 4 1 gb if the cost make more sense i hope i provided enough info and made my questions clear </s>
<s> if not scold me i have a thick skin then tell me what else you need to know </s>
<s> also i am fairly comfortable with opening the system removing the memory i have putting new in etc i have done that before it is not a matter of how to but what i need </s>
<s> thanks thanks thanks in advance agian if needed additional link to pc model with technical stats </s>
<s> 2 25gb ram </s>
<s> so why go much over 2g </s>
<s> has your model listed so stick to that and you ll be fine </s>
<s> but i don t expect more than 2 per cent speed gains on anything you said you are doing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> just for clarification are you saying if i go from 1gb to 2gb i won t get much more than a 2 or so improvement </s>
<s> or that if i go much beyond 2gb i won t get much more </s>
<s> in regards to what i am doing yes i should of been more clear </s>
<s> for the basics i don t have any issues at all email internet excel and word stuff etc </s>
<s> the only reason i am thinking about a bump up is when i go to download either a huge number of photos and edit them or when i am creating dvds </s>
<s> i know the additional memory may not actually cause the burn of the dvd to occur faster nor do i care that much i run it before i head to bed </s>
<s> but the editing dumoing of a lot of video comes to a crawl at times </s>
<s> i figured especially if i only do about 2gb for 50 00 if it helped it would be worth it </s>
<s> so given that sorry for the additional question but do you think at least bumping to 2gb would help </s>
<s> and if so are you saying that might but then beyond 2gb is just overkill especially with an older processor etc </s>
<s> thanks again for your help </s>
<s> it was xp with 2 identical machines </s>
<s> the dvd render took 6 hours on the machine with 512mb ram </s>
<s> the 1gb machine did it 5 minutes faster </s>
<s> we couldn t believe the results so we swapped ram and re ran the tests </s>
<s> same results </s>
<s> you are asking for speed so this is not where to get it as you are already at 1gb and have xp not vista which would change my answer </s>
