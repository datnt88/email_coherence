<s> i have 3 macs connected wirelessly to an airport express </s>
<s> in the past few days the wireless signal to all 3 macs has dropped twice </s>
<s> in other words although there was a steady green light on the airport express there was no signal indicated on any of the macs </s>
<s> after power cycling the airport express restarting the macs the signal was re established </s>
<s> please excuse the lengthy explanation but i am trying to see if i am on the right path to resolving this </s>
<s> a tech at my broadband isp confirmed that there was no problem with either the incoming internet line nor my cable modem </s>
<s> so the problem seems to likely reside downstream from the cable modem to the airport express </s>
<s> i have a voip phone device connected between the cable modem the airport express via ethernet cable </s>
<s> however i have been advised by a knowledgeable person that even if the voip device was faulty the airport express should nevertheless still transmit a wireless signal of course there would be no internet connection </s>
<s> if this is true it would suggest that the problem stems from the airport express itself </s>
<s> is this reasoning make sense </s>
<s> thank you for your patience any help </s>
<s> we are dealing with wifi which can be interfered with by external sources </s>
<s> to expect it to never drop means that the discussion about what wifi is needs to start </s>
<s> and i can t find your router settings </s>
<s> please try the forum suggestions </s>

<s> i am simply trying to validate the following suggestion since an airport express transmits a wireless signal regardless of whether the voip device or any other device upstream in the chain is faulty the airport express will continue to transmit </s>
<s> of course if there is an interruption in the incoming internet pathway the transmitted airport express signal will not allow the computer to connect to the internet </s>
<s> if this is reasonable it would suggest that since my computers are sporatically not receiving a wifi signal at all the problem would reside in the airport express itself </s>
<s> bob you mentioned trying the forum suggestions </s>
<s> could you please point me in that direction </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> is in the top posts called stickies in this forum </s>
<s> i think you have a good handle on the problem </s>
<s> if you can t connect to the wifi router this one is an airport with any machine then it s the airport with some 98 certainty </s>
<s> i take out my spare router for the final test as sometimes you find the owner has repeated the same mistake on all machines too many to list here </s>
<s> the old hide the ssid issue is coming back to haunt owners again </s>
<s> this old advice is making my friends lots of money as they make house calls to unhide the ssid </s>
<s> sometimes you wonder if there is a reason for the bad security advice </s>
