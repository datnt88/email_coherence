<s> hi i have an hp pavilion a600n desktop </s>
<s> i have upgraded the memory to 1mb </s>
<s> i want to upgrade the video card in it </s>
<s> i have approx 200 00 to spend on this at this time </s>

<s> general use gaming graphic design etc </s>
<s> i think u mean 1gb of ram and on ur question of vid card u have to have an adequate psu of at least 400watts then u have to giv me specs as to whether your motherboard has pci express 16 or agp slot or pci slot i will assume u have an agp slot and will suggest getting a card from nvidia since u have a budget of 200 dollars i would suggest getting a vanilla 6800 </s>
<s> what s the difference in these types of video cards </s>
<s> is one better than the other </s>
<s> i see they usually have a different price for the same card in one format or the other </s>
<s> although agp is only sometimes available pci is much slower which is why there is limited graphics card choice when it comes to that standard there is much more choice for agp as it was designed with gamers in mind </s>
<s> agp is an acronym for advanced graphics port and was specifically designed for video hardware accelerators ie video cards </s>
<s> pci stands for peripheral component interface or interconnect and was an industry upgrade from isa </s>
<s> in terms of raw speed at which each one performs in order from highest to lowest it s agp pci isa </s>
<s> much of what is developed today in terms of video either games or applications is geared to the faster ports agp </s>
<s> a new standard which is pci x or pci express is faster than agp but is only available with the newest generation of hardware </s>
