<s> i purchsed an hp system at sam s clug several months ago </s>
<s> the monitor has had a flicker from the beginning which is getting worse </s>
<s> i have tried everything in hp help and nothing seems to correct the problem </s>
<s> i have heard of the blackout problem </s>
<s> is this the way this problem starts </s>
<s> if its just flickering reduce the hertz to 60 and see if that works right click on desk top then properties then setting advanced monitor </s>
<s> there you should see screen refreshing rate </s>
<s> set it at 60 hertz and see if it helps </s>
<s> when it starts blacking out you will know because after about 1 minute when the computer turns on the monitor will blackout </s>
<s> thanks for the quot reduce the hertz quot messege </s>
<s> it was at 60hz when the flicker began and as it worsened </s>
<s> i changed it to 75hz yesterday and it worked fine for about a day then began flikcering again </s>
<s> i begins slowly and gets worse </s>
<s> sometimes the screen turns red and there are lines across the screen </s>
<s> any other suggestions </s>
<s> just by chance is they a light next to them monitor or your speakers next to it </s>
<s> that may cause the monitor to flicker too </s>
