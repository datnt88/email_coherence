<s> hi every one i am curintly useing a older asus agp not sure of the chip set </s>
<s> 2 4ghz 2 gig 512mn 7600 nvidia </s>
<s> i am looking at either to update my sistem and go with a pci board and up my proseserr to a 3 0 doul </s>
<s> or get a agp radon 3850 card </s>
<s> i m not sure if that card will boost my gameing by atleast 40 better or would it be better to get a new system with a 9800 nvidia and upgrade to three gigs of ram </s>
<s> i am willing to pay for either just ot sure on how much of a impact the new card will make </s>
<s> besides how many know about the 3g switch and how often software won t use it </s>
<s> gt the 3850 in agp is a little hard to find but i d like to move off any single core cpu today </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you re at that stage were any money sunk into an older system will the return benefit be decent </s>
<s> or you can use those funds plus some more and get abroad a newer system </s>
<s> since you mentioned gaming it maybe better to really upgrade rather than drag older stuff along </s>
<s> the choice is yours </s>
<s> the newer system pretty much requires more than new video card etc </s>
<s> and that s the extra cost but you should be better suited for newer games and or other demands placed on the system </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> but it s slower than a 160 9600gt </s>
<s> i doubt if your agp board has socket 775 so your best cpu option will probably be a 3ghz socket 478 p4 for about 80 </s>
<s> that cpu will only be comparable to low end dual core cpu at best </s>
<s> so a gpu cpu upgrade will wind up costing you 290 and you ll still be in the low end </s>
<s> instead get a 80 mobo gigabyte ga p35 s3g a 150 video card palit 9600gt and a 120 cpu core2duo e4500 oc it 3ghz by selecting 1066fsb </s>
<s> add 2gb of ram for 40 and you re at 400 only 110 above your agp upgrade but much much faster and firmly in mid range </s>
<s> what is the best mother board cpu graphics card prosseorre and ram chips </s>
<s> but my shopping list might be a core 2 dual or quad 2 0gb ram etc </s>
<s> and a card off this list gt this would get me a best to good gaming rig </s>
<s> best could be too expensive </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> just click the text in the parenthesis </s>
<s> btw the palit 9600gt has a 40 rebate making it only 110 </s>
<s> that s a fantastic price considering it s in the top 10 for single gpu gaming performance </s>
<s> perhaps this will make your choice a little clearer i am in the exact same situation as you though waiting for nehalem to come out and bought the 3850 agp </s>
<s> big mistake </s>
<s> ati amd does not offer driver support for these agp cards </s>
<s> it took me about a week to get the card to work i still have no sound b c of some driver incompatibility </s>
<s> if i were you i would save your money and a giant migrane and wait until next gen cpus come out </s>
<s> if you really must upgrade do yourself a favor and get a 7xxx nvidia card </s>
<s> stay away from 3850 agp </s>
<s> this card will work fine if you install the drivers correctly </s>
<s> meaning you will have to do a manual install of the drivers pointing windows to your folder containing the actual inf files for the card </s>
<s> you will also have to install ati tool app </s>
<s> to force windows to use the proper settings for the card </s>
<s> after this is done your card will work just fine </s>
<s> the reason for all of these quot installation hoops quot is because ati stopped manufacturing agp cards after the x1600 pro </s>
<s> all quot ati quot agp cards are now manufactured by 3rd party companies who simply build the agp card with the chipset borrowed from the original pci e card thus quot converting quot a pci e card for use in an agp environment </s>
<s> you can also try for compatible drivers for this card </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> if you decide to get a new card first detemine if the game you want requires a certain type of card </s>
<s> its weth it </s>
