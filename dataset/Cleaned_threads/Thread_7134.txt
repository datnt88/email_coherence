<s> i have a dell 2350 running a celeron processor at 1 8 ghz </s>
<s> ive upgraded memory power supply and video and graphics card and now for fun id like to try a new better processor </s>
<s> pentium if possible or a faster celeron </s>
<s> as expected dell told me no way but im wondering if any one has had any luck with this thanks in advance for any response </s>
<s> bill wegman </s>
<s> once at the support website for dell see if any quot upgrade option quot is being sold available for that model </s>
<s> if yes then get it on the open market </s>
<s> what may have happened is dell no longer offer upgrade parts as stock is depleted or too old </s>
<s> you can check the quot specs quot page as well for what if any info is available but its important that the bios be able to support any new processor of the same class </s>
<s> imho you maybe able to go to 2 4ghz but that s a maybe as if no fsb settings etc </s>
<s> can t be changed you re locked in to that processor </s>
<s> check the mtrbd </s>
<s> itself for any setting printed on possible jumpers </s>
<s> but in most cases the bios itself has to the setting area </s>
<s> check your bios and see if you can change it at all at least to a lower setting if lower can be done then very possible a higher setting can be as well </s>
<s> since this is a oem type system you re at the mercy of what the vendor allows </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> if you change too much hardware in that type of machine windows may refuse to work </s>
<s> you won t be able to reinstall windows using the dell restore disk </s>
<s> your disk is proprietary to that system </s>
<s> it will be looking for your old hardware </s>
<s> you could end up having to purchase a new windows xp cd to make it work </s>
<s> thats why it can be less expensive to purchase a new computer than update a proprietary machine </s>
<s> thanks for the info i figured im stuck </s>
<s> just have to start fresh and build something from scratch </s>
<s> bill w </s>
<s> thanks for the input i may just build a new machine from scratch </s>
<s> i always wanted to so now may be the time </s>
