<s> i have been using my samsung 40gb hard disk series mp0402h as my portable hard disk for about 1 2 years </s>
<s> last night my portable hard disk just died on me </s>
<s> the casing s led of my portable hard disk just kept blinking and my laptop couldn t detect my portable hard disk even after i tried all 4 ports of my laptop </s>
<s> i tried plugging other usb device like my mouse and cable for my mp3 player into the usb port but they work fine </s>
<s> i did not do any backup for the files in my portable hard disk </s>
<s> now i can t retrieve the documents i need for my work </s>
<s> is there anyway that i could retrieve my old files </s>
<s> thank you in advance </s>
<s> chin jin </s>
<s> or the controllers inside the case </s>
<s> have you tried putting the drive into a desktop as slave </s>
<s> this will tell you more information </s>
<s> if the hd works in the pc then the case or cord is defective </s>
<s> i just tried it on my dad s portable hard disk casing and it s the same thing </s>
<s> the led just kept blinking </s>
<s> i think i d take it to a service center </s>
<s> and hopefully a lesson is learned </s>
<s> backup </s>
<s> all my data i don t want to loose gets backed up to an external hd and that data is backed up to dvd data disks </s>
<s> i have three copies </s>
<s> having all your important quot stuff quot on only one drive is asking for trouble </s>
<s> good luck </s>
