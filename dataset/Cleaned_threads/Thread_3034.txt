<s> i ve just bought a new barebone 100 tigerdirect biostar m7ncg 400 nforce2 socket a motherboard amd sempron 3300 socket a cpu the mobo supports fsb of 400mhz also supports dual channel </s>
<s> the ram i got is pc3200 1gb 2x512mb dual channel and is identified correctly by bios it says dual channel status </s>
<s> pc3200 is 400mhz </s>
<s> the processor speed and the ram ammount in windows is showing correctly too 2 2gb and 1gb or ram </s>
<s> however in the bios settings it says that my fsb is only 200mhz </s>
<s> it should be 400mhz i tried to manually change that but fsb only goes to 250mhz </s>
<s> so there s a option so i tried 200mhz x 200 400mhz but the cl became 3 0 instead of 2 5 and the pc would not boot i pulled the cmos battery and am ready to try again how do i get my ram to run at 400mhz speed </s>
<s> as you can see i m a bit new to advanced bios settings so please explain this as you would to a ten year old thanks </s>
<s> the actual clock rate of the memory and memory bus </s>
<s> however because it is ddr sdram it reads writes on both the leading and trialing edge of the clock thus 2 read writes at 200 mhz 400 mhz effectively </s>
<s> it is simply a terminology issue </s>
<s> i doubt if your cpu supports dual channel however understand that dual channel is not a memory characteristic </s>
<s> dual channel is a mobo chipset and cpu function the memory used is simply standard ddr memory </s>
<s> just uses a pair of the same size and type </s>
<s> if you run the memory bus up to 250 mhz you may fry something </s>
<s> the mobo is simply giving you a capability to overclock your memory bus </s>
<s> that is usually done in 1 mhz steps until the system becomes unstable and then back down a mhz or two </s>
<s> lot more to it than that and you risk frying things </s>
<s> sweet speaking of overclocking i ve overclocked my athlonxp 1 73ghz to 1 8ghz very slightly and the box is already starting to act irresponsively the temperature goes way up </s>
<s> is overclocking really worth it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the big time avid gamers use it however they are students of the subject and buy all of the needed protection devices and are willing to accept losing a cpu along the way to acheive a few more fps </s>
<s> for a simple cpu slight clock speed increase you will never detect any process improvement </s>
<s> a lot of o clocking novices do not realize that as they increase the memory bus speed the pci bus and the agp bus increase their speed proportionately </s>
<s> thus any device plugged into those slots may not respond kindly to the higher speed </s>
<s> tis not a simple subject </s>
