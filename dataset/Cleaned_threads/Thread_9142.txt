<s> i m quite interested in purchasing a desktop pc in the slimline form factor but have read some negative reviews on at least one vendor </s>
<s> are there any brands that you can recommend that have a history of reliable operation </s>
<s> i d also be interested in any other comments such as service considerations restrictions on add on cards and power supply capacity </s>
<s> let s put it this way </s>
<s> these are ready to use not so ready or easy to upgrade boxes </s>
<s> the negative reviews are often from folk that went too cheap and want to add a 3d card for gaming and then run into the usual slim case issues and limitations </s>
<s> but we ve had many over the years and they re fine for what they are </s>

<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> i m just looking for an internet and email pc and would probably add microsoft office </s>
<s> there would be no need for video upgrades </s>
<s> it looks like the pc does have spare card slots but i see that they are a smaller form factor </s>
<s> would those be half height pci express slots </s>
<s> my concern is reliability as i believe i read that some of the earlier hp slimline pcs had motherboard failures and possibly overheating problems </s>
<s> it appears that acer lenovo and perhaps others have joined hp in offering the slimline pcs so i am wondering if some brands might be more reliable than others </s>
<s> my take is if the maker won t answer what the spare card slots are don t buy from them </s>
<s> as to reliability i see the drive makers are pulling back to 3 years and the machines are only 1 year warranty </s>
<s> yes they may last longer and they do here </s>
<s> but then again i know how to used the canned air once a year </s>
<s> tip </s>
<s> on your birthday change all your fire alarm batteries and find your canned air to clean your pc s vents </s>
<s> example at if you don t do the maintenance then expect shorter life spans </s>
