<s> hi and before i get started thank you so much for the help </s>
<s> i m not computer illiterate at all but when it comes down to the very technical details such as overclocking and such i m still new </s>
<s> i m running an nforce chipset with an amd sempron 3300 </s>
<s> it s overclocked to 2 2ghz and i have two sticks of corsair 512mb pc2700 ddr sdram in the two adjoining slots </s>
<s> for whatever reason it s reporting running in single channel mode </s>
<s> both are running at 166mhz which is their base speed </s>
<s> i also have a stick of 256mb pc3200 ddr ram samsung that i tried putting in the 3rd dimm </s>
<s> the computer boots fine and it recognizes it but then i constantly get the bsod with quot irql is less than or equal quot nonsense </s>
<s> i ve checked and updated every driver i know of and so i m left to believe it s a ram issue since i never had that problem prior to putting in the 3rd dimm </s>
<s> anyway to only make this as long as it needs to be i would like to know a couple things </s>
<s> a how can i adjust the bios to allow all 3 dimms w o hangups </s>
<s> b if i can t how can i set the bios to push the other 2 dimms to dual channel </s>
<s> thank you in advance for all your help and i look forward to your replies </s>

<s> one more thing to add i m running windows xp pro sp2 thanks again </s>
