<s> hi i ve been searching for a very long time for an answer to my problem </s>
<s> i m hoping someone here may have that answer </s>
<s> o i have a netgear wgt624v2 108mbps wireless router </s>
<s> 2 pcs are connected wirelessly with netgear wg311t pci cards and 1 pc is connected wired to the router </s>
<s> the problem is this when viewing certain websites pages over wireless the router will lock up </s>
<s> the router lights perform normal even windows xp pro and home remains connected but there s no connection </s>
<s> wired pc can t connect can t connect to the router s configuration pages can t browse local network it completely shuts everything out </s>
<s> all caused by simply trying to load a web page </s>
<s> when viewing these sites pages over wired however the problem doesn t occur </s>
<s> it s only over wireless on any pc that the problem can happen </s>
<s> there are various sites that can cause this so when viewing google results chances are one of them will lock up the router requiring a router reboot </s>
<s> you can only imagine how frustrating that is </s>
<s> what s interesting is if i reboot the router and view a page i know causes this straight away sometimes the page will load fine </s>
<s> if however i view a few pages first before the culprit page it will definitely lock up </s>
<s> also it s not specific to a dns name but more a url website area </s>
<s> for example works fine as does 99 of its pages but does not </s>
<s> that section will kill my router 99 99 of the time </s>
<s> there are other sites such as reporter mozilla org that will do the same thing and countless others </s>
<s> netgear support have been fantastic </s>
<s> i have a support rep who calls me at home and we try various things testing with encryption off various other router settings and i ve even been sent a new version of the router </s>
<s> a wgt624v3 which is much improved still has the same problem </s>
<s> could it be a compatibility issue with my cable modem </s>
<s> i ve never seen an issue like this before have you </s>
<s> regards craig </s>
<s> i might also clean out those temporary internet pages as well as those cookies and clear the history file </s>
<s> while i consider it much like a car maker delivering a busted car and asking you to do the final fix the firmware on your new router is often out of date </s>
<s> the maker s website should have the update and how to install it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for both replies </s>
<s> trying a different brand isn t a solution i m afraid </s>
<s> my router uses proprietary methods to delivery 108mbps </s>
<s> else i ll have 108mbps cards running at 54mbps </s>
<s> cookies are not stored cache is emptied when firefox is closed history isn t even stored 0 days setting </s>
<s> not that i don t appreciate your reply but that s too obvious a solution and of course i ve already tried it </s>
<s> besides the problem doesn t happen on wired even with a full cache </s>
<s> i keep the firmware up to date </s>
<s> in fact at one point it seemed to improve on a few updates </s>
<s> the firmware with the v3 model is up to date </s>
<s> it s only just hit the stores </s>
<s> as a gesture netgear have replaced my v2 with a v3 </s>
<s> i ve still got to work out this problem though </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> i have the same issue running the same router but with the original v1 model </s>
<s> it often locks up and the only fix is to manually reset the power </s>
<s> i ve tried the same maintenance as well firmware upgrades cleaning out temp cache and cookie files etc </s>
<s> though it could be a specific problem with the 108 mbps function i ve yet to find a solution </s>
<s> it s dissapointing but the only solution if you want to maintain 108 mbps may be to upgrade to a new model though there s no guarantee that you won t run into the same problem </s>
<s> i ve tried different modes auto 108 108 only standard g 54mbps various encryption options on and off and it makes no difference </s>
<s> there must be thousands of people with netgear routers on the same isp as me </s>
<s> i m going to try my router and card on a friend s pc who has the same isp as me and see if it works there </s>
<s> if it does i ll have to try and get a new cable modem from my isp o </s>
<s> even though the wgt624 v3 model just hit the stores it may have been boxed months ago </s>
<s> take a look at the firmware on netgear com </s>
<s> it looks like there is a quot version 1 0 128_1 0 1 quot </s>
<s> it was published on 15 sep 2005 and includes 12 bug fixes </s>
<s> on the other end download the latest driver for the wireless network adapter </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> another c net member did and was told a specific version of firmware to use </s>
<s> it cured their issue </s>
<s> sometimes you must ask mother </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> for the passed year i ve always used the latest firmware </s>
<s> even releases that aren t public yet and still no joy </s>
<s> with regards to the cards they re using the latest drivers too </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> i would have returned it as defective </s>
<s> called in to who </s>
<s> dumb question </s>
<s> lol this is why i posted my problem here hoping someone had the same issue and a fix for it </s>
<s> it s quite a unique case otherwise it would be known by netgear </s>
<s> there were a few previous versions of firmware that seemed to perform better but the problem was still there </s>
<s> that suggests a flaw in the firmware but there s thousands of people who use netgear routers on the same isp as me </s>
<s> it would be known straight away if there was such a problem </s>
<s> when i test it at my friend s house on his connection if the result is fine i ll ask for a new cable modem from my isp </s>
<s> my current one is around 5 years old and the modems they ship now are completely different </s>
<s> i have already had it replaced once the company i bought it from said it sounds faulty but i was disappointed to find the problem was still there </s>
<s> 2 months of waiting for netgear support to reply lol i get a personal phone call from one support tech who s currently trying his best to solve the problem </s>
<s> we were hoping the version 3 i had version 2 would be the fix but we were wrong </s>
<s> still i got a nicer more expensive too </s>
<s> looking router as a replacement </s>
<s> it s still frustrating though o </s>
