<s> i m looking at buying a used system for my nieces nephews since theirs just died </s>
<s> right now looking at a nice dell gx745 sff which has a 275w power supply which can not be replaced by a regular after market unit </s>
<s> question is looking at low rise single slot video card upgrades around 35 i see that cards like the radeon hd5450 requires a min </s>
<s> of a 400w power supply but when i research the card s benchmark tests i see that it s max power consumption is only 19w </s>
<s> so when looking at video cards do i look at min </s>
<s> required specs </s>
<s> or the actual power consumption </s>
<s> otherwise with a 275w power supply i don t think they make a pcie video card that low in specs that can be considered an upgrade </s>
<s> i don t think i can help if you believe the 5450 requires that many watts </s>
<s> but it is the card of choice when we can t change the psu </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i ve seen a few sites that showed benchmarks stating that the card s max power consumption is under 20w which makes sense if the video cards requires a full 400 watts then what s left to power the rest of the computer </s>
<s> i tried the wattage calculator on newegg and said that with the systems specs and that card total min would be 248w which kinda pushing it since likely dell s 275w power supply isn t really 275w </s>
<s> well guy never replied back for the computer anyway and found another dell with a 305w power supply same system but the mid tower and read where a few people have installed similar cards without problems </s>
<s> url examples </s>
<s> my hp d4999t is pretty stock with 4gb ram one hdd 2 dvdrw drives and a some nvidia 1gb 240 or such card </s>
<s> on the p3 watt meter it s at 200 watts when a 3d game runs so i don t worry about it s stock 300 watt psu </s>
<s> it s a little tight and while i like to run at 50 or less of the rating this machine is rather dated so we ll just let it be </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bought the mid tower model of the dell 745 with 305w power supply </s>
<s> added the ati hd5450 1gb low profile card and runs perfectly fine </s>
