<s> hello all im here looking for some really good help on building up a new desktop </s>
<s> i just got an very old desktop that has basically nothing in it </s>
<s> the hard drive only has 7gb max 128mb of ram i odnt think theres a sound card or w e </s>
<s> so yeah its pretty old and basic </s>
<s> i want to upgrade everything but really dont know where to start should i start with the hard drive </s>
<s> a new mobo or start with ram </s>
<s> i dont wanna dish out thousands of dollars i just want something that decent for gaming and entertainment and doing shcool stuff </s>
<s> so any simple help on where i should start would be great </s>
<s> you cannot simply upgrade your system as you go </s>
<s> do not toss your computer as you may find it fun to play with it later learning about different oss without having to mess with dual booting </s>
<s> you can also make it into a router nas print server wifi router usb hub etc </s>
<s> if you lay down a price i ll help you build one on newegg </s>
<s> good starting point mix and match as the budget allows </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> you ram motherboard power supply unit and cpu all have to be compatible </s>
<s> compatitbility comes in generations </s>
<s> by slowly upgrading you would lose a lot of bang for your buck </s>
<s> whilst just replacing would be an effective way to get a nice computer </s>
<s> also please list any games you would actually want to play </s>
<s> you can look up the recommended hardware for the game you want to play and keep those specs in mind when picking out parts </s>
