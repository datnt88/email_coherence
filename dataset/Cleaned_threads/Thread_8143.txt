<s> i want to edit my boring vacation and other vhs camcorder tapes into something more interesting and i m going to buy a new computer and need to know aside from a large hard drive and lots of ram what other features and software i need </s>
<s> not trying to be a pro just have a little fun </s>
<s> you will need some form of video capture device to transfer and convert the analog tapes into digital format </s>
<s> then some software to edit it </s>
<s> lots of choices out there just type quot video capture quot into a google search </s>
<s> here s some combo that works </s>
<s> 1 the haupaugge tv pci capture card </s>
<s> the go product is mono but does not matter since capture is from your audio card </s>
<s> you can use it s capture software to get the first step done </s>
<s> less that 50 dollars </s>
<s> 2 a dvd recorder with bundled software </s>
<s> many out there but a multi format unit with plus and minus media support and dvd creation software light video editing too starts at 113 dollars </s>
<s> maybe a trip to radio shack for a cable but unlikely </s>
<s> the host machine for a 2 hour video will have about 20gb free during the work and even my older p3 600 with 256 mb or ram could do the dvd creation overnight </s>
<s> even with more ram and many more ghz of cpu you still have to be patient </s>
<s> bottomline </s>
<s> this is getting a lot cheaper </s>

<s> as i understand it i need 1 something to convert my vhs tape to a digital format to be understood by my computer </s>
<s> one solution is the card mentioned ati tv wonder pci </s>
<s> another solution would be a converter like the one from dazzle </s>
<s> moderately priced computer would not come with such a card but might be purchased as an option </s>

<s> try something like the sony vrd vc10 </s>
<s> it s an mpeg2 encoder and dvd rw burner built in </s>
<s> all you need to do is hook up your vcr to it and then put a dvd r disc into the unit and start converting with the push of a button </s>
<s> if you want to do edits you can still use this unit or the hundreds of others that can also dump your movie onto a computer do your edits i recommend videoredo videoredo com then burn using a dvd burner or that same vrd vc10 for example </s>
<s> alternatively you can have your movies converted professionally </s>
<s> there are many conversion shops to choose from </s>
<s> for example cheers </s>
<s> my answer has changed as the dazzle is not around anymore </s>
<s> why reply to such an old post </s>
<s> because this post is indexed in google and many people may be searching for tips on vhs to dvd conversion and hit an old thread with outdated info happy </s>
