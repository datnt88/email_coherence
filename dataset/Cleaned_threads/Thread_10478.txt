<s> hello i m not sure if anyone has ever heard of this problem but i ll still give it a shot </s>
<s> i will try to explain it as much as i can </s>
<s> say i connected to my network but then if i turn off the router without turning off the wireless on my laptop and then i turn the router back on again my laptop wont connect to the network again it can t even find any access points </s>
<s> i got two access points in my house i have to restart my laptop to fix it but i wont have any issues if i turn off the wireless on my laptop before turning off the router </s>
<s> it would connect again with no problem </s>
<s> does anyone think it could be a service that i disabled or put on manual </s>
<s> any help greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> we have a note on what to change in our forum sticky </s>
<s> i m sorry but i can t seem to find anything in the sticky that may solve my issue </s>
<s> care to tell me which post is it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> meanwhile i ll keep searching for it </s>
<s> but your post s details are so slim that i m guessing it may or may not help </s>
