<s> here is my issue </s>
<s> i work in an i t </s>
<s> office but our wireless guy left and we havent gotten a replacement yet </s>
<s> this is probably a simple question but i have googled it and cant find the answer </s>
<s> i have a few doctors that when they take their laptops home and connect wirelessly the laptop will not find our work wireless when they come back </s>
<s> we are running vista business with cisco g wireless </s>
<s> any basic troubleshooting tips would be very much appreciated </s>
<s> thanks dean </s>
<s> is ssid turned on at work </s>
<s> it s about half way down the page but you can google the setting i m changing to get vista to connect </s>
<s> here s the words gt vista broadcast flag </s>
<s> sure you can argue that it connects at home </s>
<s> all that will do is have me tell you to replace your wifi router wap or upgrade the firmware on the waps </s>
<s> btdt hope you fix it fast now </s>
