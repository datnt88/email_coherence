<s> hello i m looking for a good quality photo printer 5 or more colors that will print on many types of media and up to 13x19 paper </s>
<s> i ve read the cnet editor recommendations but i won t buy another epson stylus due to all the problems i ve had with mine the printer where i work and those that my sister has experienced </s>
<s> canon s i9900 looked promising until i discovered one must use only canon paper how realistic is that </s>
<s> i would appreciate any suggestions as i am completely without a printer now the epson stylus 1280 i have has quit after three years of light use </s>
<s> thank you for any suggestions </s>
<s> i too got fed up with the epson </s>
<s> i had two that failed after a short time with a printhead issue </s>
<s> i switched to hp in order to avoid that </s>
<s> if you want to be able to print 13x19 there will be fewer choices </s>
<s> while i do not have one of these here is a link to a review of one also photosmart printers can print directly from the camera media or computer and this one hp 8750 has built in network capabilities </s>
<s> of course with the capablility to print 13x19 pictures you have to expect a pricetag that is hefty also </s>
<s> thank you for your suggestion </s>
<s> i m checking into it </s>
