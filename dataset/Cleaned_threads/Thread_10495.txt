<s> hi i have a custom built computer with an intel pentium d processor ati radeon x800 video card a 250 gig hdd and an intel mobo </s>
<s> my computer worked for 3 months until one day upon turning it on both my mobo and my power supply fried </s>
<s> i replaced both and it started working again </s>
<s> however 6 hours after it started working it just turned off </s>
<s> it had no response to anything </s>
<s> i replaced the power supply with a more powerful one from a amore reliable company and now wheenever i turn on the power supply the computer s case fans and the video card s fan will click on for a second </s>
<s> at the same time there is a strange clicking noise that the computer makes </s>
<s> what could be the problem </s>
<s> is it a grounding issue </s>
<s> or is it something else i haven t thought of </s>
<s> too bad you re learning the hard way that power issues effect the whole system </s>
<s> 3mo </s>
<s> isn t long for a decent system to feel the effects of a poor psu </s>
<s> you did the right thing in covering the repair replacing both psu and mtrbd </s>
<s> but it quot seems quot you settled on a lesser wattage unit same value </s>
<s> and not a higher wattage one in the replacement process and in all probably used the same cpu etc </s>
<s> componets to rebuild the system </s>
<s> a secnondary problem was lying in wait of one of the other componets </s>
<s> you should remove all hds cds and even the fd drive and make it as simple as possible system </s>
<s> try then to reboot if it fails quickly shutdown </s>
<s> now teardown the whole system and rebuild it with care to mounting posts cabling etc </s>
<s> back to a simple system to rerty again </s>
<s> it need not be in the system case on cardboard or non conductive quot surface to make the system to see what the results are </s>
<s> if it still fails then again the mtrbd </s>
<s> or psu was made kaput </s>
<s> if not and it boots up then add quot one quot componet at a time until it fails or seems to be stable </s>
<s> allow it work for awhile just leave it alone for hrs </s>
<s> and see if it still works </s>
<s> return to system case if it does and proceed there one step at a time </s>
<s> verify all your work etc no guessing or taking anything for granted if any thoughts replace or test elsewhere </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> last fall i built two pcs similar to yours intel 945 mobos antec cases power supplies dual sata drives p4d 3 0ghz in one p4 3 4ghz in the other </s>
<s> the first build went smooth as butter and booted up the first try </s>
<s> the second one took me another 4 days because it wouldn t boot </s>
<s> the lan leds would come on the cpu fan would spin for a sec then nothing </s>
<s> i tore down the functioning pc and started swapping parts and still no luck </s>
<s> my problem was the extra 2x2 pin mobo power connector 12v processor core voltage i forgot to plug it in </s>
<s> hope your problem is as simple </s>
<s> i already made sure that was plugged in </s>
<s> my case fans start up and the led lights do turn on as well as the cpu s water cooling starting up for about a split second then they all turn off </s>
<s> the light on the mobo is on </s>
<s> and it is a 600 watt power supply should be almost excessive </s>
<s> i did take it to best buy once when i got this problem they got it to boot but i have no idea how </s>
<s> you should check out this page which helps you understand how your computer starts up then troubleshoot from there </s>
