<s> i have a belkin n router three hours ago my router disconnected it was secured after it disconnected i tried to connect it said its unsecured i tried unplugging it that didn t work so i reset it and i selected wpa when i chose that i entered my password i clicked on apply changes everytime i click on apply changes for wpa my router disconnects </s>
<s> if your were able to connect in an unsecured state that means the router itself has lost its wireless security settings </s>
<s> it may have been due to a power problem glitch in the hardware or malevolent action </s>
<s> you didn t post the specific model belkin but hopefully the following will help </s>
<s> i recommend resetting the router to its factory default setting using the reset button on the device </s>
<s> then navigate to 192 168 2 1 and adjust the settings </s>
<s> you may want to visit the belkin website if you are not familiar with adjusting your router settings </s>
<s> if you still have your router s setup disk and feel more comfortable using that instead of the manual method then try it that way </s>
<s> i already reset it when i reset it i go into security and choose wpa psk then enter my password then when i click apply changes my signal bar has a red x then disconnects i have to reset it every time thats the only way it connects unplugging it doesn t work </s>
<s> i have a belking f5d8236 4 v3 </s>
<s> i deleted wireless profile then connected again it worked </s>
