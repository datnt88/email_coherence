<s> i now have a nec multisync lcd1700m the multisync lcd1700m 17 quot tft active matrix display has a 1280 x 1024 60hz resolution with 264mm dot pitch </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> viewsonic or samsung both make good monitors and both offer models with built in speakers if that is what you are looking for </s>
<s> you should be able to support bigger monitors at least in terms of pixels </s>
<s> i would suggest you double check but 22 quot level resolutions of 1680 x 1050 ish should not be a problem </s>
<s> not sure how the bigger picture will look or how it will perform though </s>
<s> btw your hp link is dead at 200 you re in 22 quot territory </s>
<s> samsung make some decent budget 22 inchers shop around on newegg etc </s>
<s> i m not an enormous fan of large cheap monitors since they tend to be based around tn panels which results in noticeable colour changes at the edges of a gt 20 quot monitor when sitting in front of it but a 22 quot is bearable for me for the most part and i m sure for most the colour shift wouldn t even register most of the time </s>
<s> i ve used the 08 predecessor of this monitor in quad monitor configurations and i felt it was as good as any 22 quot monitor i ve tried </s>
<s> this is my pc i will post again in a little bit with more info </s>
<s> thanks for the answers thusfar </s>
<s> basically what i would like to have is a little bit bigger screen but it doesnt necessarly have to be a 22 quot screen a 19 quot wide screen could be just fine </s>
<s> so far i have been looking at dell samsung and hp monitors </s>
<s> i know there is a blue billion generic brand monitors and while i have nothing against them i question their reliability as well as quality </s>
<s> i wont be doing anything but surfing the net watching dvd s not worried about high definition for the most part and running online poker programs such as pokerstars as well as the various other online poker sites </s>
<s> i would either like built in speakers or some usb on the monitor itself it does not have to have both </s>
<s> if it did that would be great just not required </s>
<s> if i need to sacrafice a little smaller screen to have a better picture resolution etc then so be it </s>
<s> i really don t want a monitor that makes it hard to read text </s>
<s> yes i use clear type the nec multisync 1700m that i ve had for about 8 years has been outstandingly reliable but was made in 2001 and im sure there are some new monitors out there that would just blow my mind when comparing this nec to whatever is so many years newer </s>
<s> i have looked at ebay at pacificgeek ecost and a few other sites and have been trying to look at the innumerous lcd monitor reviews and keeping them all straight has become quite a challenge </s>
<s> i have hoped to come across a review site that had a dropdown of features so i could compare easier but i have yet to find such a site </s>
<s> again thank you for any input you may have i am not as technologically is that a word </s>
<s> heh smart as many are </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> all links to monitors that might fit what i am asking for would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i really am not to concerned with a swivel but i am in a tilt feature </s>
<s> am sticking to my guns still say samsung or viewsonic either one both would meet your requirements at a reasonable cost </s>
<s> a number of monitors </s>
<s> viewsonic and samsung are in those makes that i ve owned and own today </s>
<s> good call </s>
