<s> i came back to my pc after a nice weekend away turn it on and i get ntdlr missing </s>
<s> great </s>
<s> so i whack in the vista disk and think its just a case of start up repair </s>
<s> when i restart the screen stays black and eventually tells me i have no disks </s>
<s> long story short i reset bios nothing i remove and swap all my parts nothing </s>
<s> i take out the hard drive works fine except for the obvious lack of a hard drive </s>
<s> so i put the drive in another system it booted fine onto that systems vista but it doesnt see the other drive not in disk management or any other 3rd party software and i have plenty of data recovery software ive been through this before </s>
<s> the drive still spins up but isnt recognised </s>
<s> so really im just asking it is drive failure isnt it so now onto the fix </s>
<s> like i said ive had this happen before and i really dont like losing my data </s>
<s> so im looking into ways to stop disk failure for doing this so obviously im going for raid but im not 100 on raid ill read the wikipedia but that only helps so much </s>
<s> if someone could just tell me what raid i want 1 2 3 </s>
<s> to just have two drive s with the exact same data on them </s>
<s> sorry for long post guys </s>
<s> believe raid will you best answer for backup or redundancy </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> if i bought the exact same drive and just swapped the chip could that fix it </s>
<s> i have no evidence to say the chip is broken there was no smoke and it doesn t smell and the drive still spins up </s>
<s> i just don t know what else to do </s>
<s> just keep in mind you have to match the logic board and the logic board s firmware </s>
<s> are you focusing on data recovery or data redundancy backup </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i don t want this to happen again either </s>
<s> so i suppose i put two posts in one </s>
<s> sorry about that </s>
<s> anyways ive already set up the return so now its a data backup question i suppose </s>
<s> i don t want the hassle of having to make backups every day or of having to restart it all if this happens again </s>
<s> i thought raid was the answer </s>
<s> if one drive fails it just uses the other which was just a clone </s>
<s> maybe i was lied to about raid ha ha </s>
<s> quot we only lose what we didn t backup quot we have long discussions about backup in these forums </s>
<s> my backup routine is pretty simple </s>
<s> i copy out to an external usb drive then to a sftp server then to a new snazzy 8gb memory stick just the items i can t lose and occasional to dvdr about 6 </s>
<s> anyone that won t backup has set the value of their files </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> your right as always bob </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
