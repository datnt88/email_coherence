<s> we have a modem connected to a cisco 506e pix firewall connected to a 25 port cisco switch </s>
<s> we re using the pix as the dhcp server </s>
<s> one server machine functioning as dns server etc </s>
<s> connected to the switch 23 wired desktop connections and two netgear wireless access points </s>
<s> the aps have the dhcp function turned off </s>
<s> here s the problem i can connect multiple pcs to each ap but only one pc per ap can be connected to the server and internet at a time </s>
<s> i need to be able to connect multiple pcs to the server internet via these aps </s>
<s> i ve configured the same wireless aps elsewhere at our remote sites with no problem but they were connected via a router to a modem no server or pix involved </s>
<s> any suggestions on how to troubleshoot </s>
<s> i assume these are true ap and not routers </s>
<s> this would mean that each device would pass its own mac address up the path </s>
<s> first i would check the firewall logs to make sure you are not getting anything denied via rule </s>
<s> since i assume your wired pc work i doubt this is the problem </s>
<s> just a guess but i would suspect a port security setting on the switch </s>
<s> one of the many option in cisco is to allow only a single mac on a port </s>
<s> the switch should produce error messages into the log </s>
<s> you can also do a show mac address command on the ports you are having issues with </s>
<s> you should see multiple macs assigned to that port </s>
<s> thanks bill i ve checked the firewall and there don t seem to be issues there and as far as the aps one is a true ap the other a router configured as an ap </s>
<s> i ve spent lots of time chasing my tail on the router configuration but i m pretty sure it s solid </s>
<s> i think you ve got me pointed in the right direction with switch configuration which i haven t checked out at all </s>
<s> the company that installed the switch before my time never set up an interface for it so i ll do that over the weekend and see if there are settings that will fix the problem </s>
<s> i m an accidental techie working for a nonprofit with serious budget constraints so really appreciate your help </s>
