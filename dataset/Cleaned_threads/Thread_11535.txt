<s> hello i just got a new asus a8v motherboard and its not booting </s>
<s> it turns on when i press the button but i get no signal sent to the monitor and i get a faint beep that sounds like it might be posting </s>
<s> here s what im running asus a8v k8t800 pro mobo amd athalon 4000 clawhammer 939 pin chaintech geforce 5500fx agp 4x 8x corsair valueselect 1gb 2 x 512mb 184 pin ddr sdram ddr 400 so i got the board monday i plugged everyhting in im not getting anything </s>
<s> any ideas on what the problem might be </s>
<s> i know that the ram isnt on the preffered list but im not sure how picky this board is </s>
<s> here is a little bit more info </s>
<s> prior to monday i was runnign the same setup except i had a msi k8n neo2 platinum mobo </s>
<s> for a while i was having a problem where it was locking up durring boot or the monitor would switch off </s>
<s> last week i lost video </s>
<s> i had run some ram tests before and they both passed so i ruled them out as the problem </s>
<s> last week i lost my video again and it didnt come back when rebooting </s>
<s> i ran down to staples thinking that my vid card may have burned out and got another geforce 5500 when i put the new card in i still was getting nothing </s>
<s> eventualy i put the old card back in and after i tried i a few more times the video came back </s>
<s> this let me rule out the video card being bad becasue i figgured the new one would have worked if that was the problem </s>
<s> this also led me to the conclusion that the msi mobo was bad </s>
<s> but now that i have the asus in and still am having no luck getting it working im hoping that its not somehting like the processor </s>
<s> anyway i know that was a bit long winded but i wanted to get all the info in there </s>
<s> any one have any ideas or have a similar experince </s>
<s> thanks christian </s>
<s> what type of psu how many total watts and how many amps on 12v rail and have you checked it out as being the possible culprit </s>
<s> i am going to try and pick one up on my way home from work today to see fi that is the problem thansk for the help </s>
<s> ok so somewhere along the line i screwed up </s>
<s> after buying a new powersupply and still nothign happening i was pretty much ready to give up </s>
<s> on a whim i lugged the computer down to my dads and hooked up his monitor just to see if anyhtign was goin on and lo and behold up came the bios </s>
<s> aparently not only has my monitor gone bad but also my back up monitor </s>
<s> could just be the cable anyway here is the new problem </s>
<s> i was able to get inot grub to choose if i wanted to boot into windows and linux </s>
<s> but when i choose one the computer restarts </s>
<s> so i figgured that i would just start by wiping the drives and throwing windows back on there </s>
<s> i can boot off my instal cd and i get into the set up screen but the windows set up is telling me that it cant locate a hard drive </s>
<s> when i check the bios it tells me that my hard drives are there </s>
<s> even the fact that i can get to grub and even to the part where windows asks if i want to boot in safe mode the last known good config or normal tells me that the hard drives are there </s>
<s> what should i do </s>
<s> a lot of the internals of your computer perhaps you have a windows registration problem as it is no longer recognised by the new motherboard </s>
<s> or you have to change some default bios settings at boot </s>
<s> check the asus manual </s>
<s> i checked my bios settings last night and didnt see anything in particular that i thought would address this problem </s>
<s> i also put the cd that came along with the mobo in and booted from that in hopes that it would have somehting on there to fix my problem </s>
<s> do you think the fact the i dual boot to linux has any thign to do with the windows setup not beaingabel to see the drive </s>
<s> i also have the same motherboard and experienced boot problems </s>
<s> what you will probably have to do for your system to remain stable is to update the motherboard bios on the asus website </s>
<s> they have instructions on what you will need to do </s>
<s> tried 2 and gave up replaced it with an msi </s>
<s> yep i had same problem with my pc </s>
<s> after replacing one ram stick dvd motherborad 3rd one </s>
<s> and hard drive </s>
<s> windows would not install called microsoft and problem fixed1 </s>
