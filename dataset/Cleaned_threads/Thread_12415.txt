<s> just recently my mate built me a computer and it has 2 hard drives a c drive and e drive </s>
<s> the problem is that the c drive only has 4gb while the e drive has 600gb </s>
<s> i dont know alot about computers so im worried about playing aorund with it 2 much without help but windows etc is stored on the c drive and it is always at low disk space </s>
<s> how can i get windows to load and install programs on the e drive so there is plently of room </s>
<s> is there any advantages to the way it is set up now </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> this is a quite ridiculous setup that won t last long to break down </s>
<s> back to your mate and let him redo it </s>
<s> he should use windows xp setup to delete both partitions and then create a new one covering the whole 604 gb disk and install xp on that </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> that setup was for them and not you </s>
<s> i d heard many reasons why to do such a thing but to saddle a new user with such an onerous setup is just not nice </s>
<s> do it over </s>
<s> bob </s>
