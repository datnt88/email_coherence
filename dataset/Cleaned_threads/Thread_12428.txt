<s> hey guys i have searched around all over the net for a solution </s>
<s> i am trying to network my small office </s>
<s> we have 3 computers all on our wifi network </s>
<s> we do not have any file sharing setup </s>
<s> i would rather shy away from doing a partition on one of the computers and sharing that space </s>
<s> i would rather just buy a external hard drive with large capacity to do a full backup of each computer through the shared drive </s>
<s> i have seen certain products like the buffalo or linksys router that you hook up the external hard drive too but then the user reviews are usually pretty bad </s>
<s> wondering what is cost effective that works and has high speed capability for the backing up of the computers to the hard drive </s>
<s> ideally i would like the end result to be that on each computer the shared drive shows up just like the quot c quot drive when you click on my computer </s>
<s> thank you very much for any help or advice </s>
<s> today the complaints are all about speed and ease of use </s>
<s> today there is no product that does this well </s>
<s> to really hear the complaints stick any network storage on wifi and even with the ear plugs in the screams are easily heard </s>

<s> i have a nice little nas </s>
<s> it s connected to my router and contains a 450 gig sata drive </s>
<s> it s accessible from all my wired and wireless pcs and has worked flawlessly </s>
<s> and the nas has a little button that makes backups </s>
<s> opening explorer in each pc shows the nas as another hard drive </s>
<s> i am trying to do something similar but mine is for my house </s>
<s> i currently have 3 computers on line network and will be adding 2 more </s>
<s> i am using a belkin n wireless router </s>
<s> this allows me to plug via usb 2 0 into the router and the storage devise is linked into the other computers </s>
<s> i am currentlyn using windows vista 64bit as the main computer and have been having trouble finding an external nas hard drive </s>
<s> as recently as today though i believe i have found the cavalry cand3002to 1tb external hard drive nas which is compatable </s>
<s> i called cavalry today and they said it is </s>
<s> buy com has it on sale for 262 99 w free s h </s>
<s> best price i found </s>
<s> i am a novice at all this also but i do my research </s>
<s> i have networked my house on my own and i am very pleased with the belkin n </s>
<s> i might add that my home is 4 stories with the router located on the third with no probs </s>
<s> let me know if you think its good for u or you see something better </s>
<s> i always like to be sure </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> i got the router for about 90 00 all together u should be able to hook up for around 350 00 good luck </s>
