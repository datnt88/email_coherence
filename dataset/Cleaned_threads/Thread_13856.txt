<s> i have two video cards a nvidia geforce 7300 le which is installed in my computer and an old geforce 4 which is not in my computer my computer runs slow sometimes when running games and a friend told me that there was a way to run both video cards on one computer and this will make games and such run smoother </s>
<s> however i am not really sure how to install both or even if installing both cards actualy makes the computer run faster </s>

<s> people who put two toally differant video cards together not sli do it not for real perfomance but to have more then one monitor </s>
<s> if you want good perfmance you have to have a sli bridge </s>
<s> idk if any of the cards that you metinoed are sli ready but if they are you might be able to bridge them then you get a small perfomance upgrade </s>
<s> but not really worth it most likely </s>
