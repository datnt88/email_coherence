<s> i ve been working with gaining space on my hard drive i had 3 partitions primary 220 gb backup around 8 gb empty 1 gb or something now i ve deleted the empty one and shrunk the backup one it was vista and i have 7 now but i can t extend the primary partition in to the unallocated space </s>
<s> the problem might be that the backup partition is quot in between quot the primary and unallocated areas </s>
<s> is there a way i can fix this </s>
<s> by the way i already know about the diskmgmt thing that s what i ve been using </s>
<s> feel free to ask for clarification </s>
<s> thank s for your support deven p s </s>
<s> can i upload pictures to this or is that not allowed </s>
<s> generally speaking you can t change a partition if it s the one you re booting from </s>
<s> if i needed to do it right now i d use acronis disk director </s>
<s> you usually get the sw load the program and create a bootable cd that allows you to modify the primary bootable partition and the other partitions if any </s>
<s> question is why do you want to do this </s>
<s> before going further have you backed up your data </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> 1gb is nothing </s>
<s> why not just extend the backup </s>
<s> i ve shrunk the backup drive since it wasn t in use </s>
<s> now it s more than just a measly little gigabyte and a half </s>
<s> thank s for the concern though </s>
<s> thank s for your input </s>
<s> and to answer your questions quot question is why do you want to do this quot for two reasons </s>
<s> 1 i ve made more space than a gigabyte free since i ve shrunk the backup partition because wasn t in use </s>
<s> 2 i m paranoid about having as much free space as i can manage without having to skim down on progams and stuff too much </s>
<s> you d probably be amazed at some of the things i use on my laptop s </s>
<s> quot before going further have you backed up your data quot not yet but i m about to </s>
<s> thanks for your concern </s>
<s> i guess that i m going to have to put the space getting on hold for now since the wireless internet capabilities have recently given out on me </s>
<s> that s why i took so long to respond </s>
<s> i typed this on my other laptop </s>
<s> thanks for all the help deven </s>
<s> once you ve decided you have a few backups and a few recovery plans you could use gparted to push the partitions around and extend them </s>
<s> this is not an offer to write the tutorial here </s>
<s> this is your data and your choice </s>
<s> when you do this it s never a sure thing and this has confused folk new to playing with partitions </s>
<s> it s safer to juggle sticks of dynamite </s>
