<s> i have an hp 6635 pavilion running win 98 and linux i want to upgrade it to xp </s>
<s> i formatted the drive </s>
<s> but linux still comes up when the machine boots up </s>
<s> the linux has errors and that does not boot up properly help </s>
<s> you just need to rewrite the boot loader </s>
<s> if you find your way to the xp recovery console then fixmbr will overwrite it </s>
<s> in closing a proper xp install does not use the old dos format command </s>
<s> those who don t learn the new ways tend to suffer a little </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> how did you format the drive </s>
<s> if it was truly formatted linux should not be able to quot come back quot </s>
<s> so the xp installation disk doesn t actually reformat when you tell it to </s>
<s> thats odd but not surprising </s>
<s> is there an easy way to zero a drive using the xp disk </s>
<s> i ve never found a format that did </s>
<s> programs like fdisk from dos me days and fixmbr diddle with that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i was wondering about this </s>
<s> i tried to install xp after formatting the drive via xp cd and low and behold all of the old user files were still there </s>
<s> what i am used to with the ox install cd you have the option for 3 levels of erasing quick zero zero then write random </s>
<s> i assumed this was standard </s>
