<s> my son recently gave me his computer and i am cvery happy and very grateful however there is one problem </s>
<s> the hard drive c is absolutely full of dross i e </s>
<s> bits of uninstalled programs and such like </s>
<s> i have used registry mechanic and although it reports that i have 468 errors on my drive it will only repair 29 of them as have a few others i have tried therefore my question is this can anyone recommend a good free program that will actually repair the errors as well as finding them </s>
<s> thank you for taking the time to read this and for any help you may offer </s>
<s> what kind of errors are being noted </s>
<s> if it s just crosslinked files and such the os what is it </s>
<s> may have a built in utility </s>
<s> if it s actual bad sectors the remedy is different or not available </s>
<s> in worst cases you can erase the drive with a utility from the manufacturer that will do a sector by sector surface analysis </s>
<s> some can quot move quot unrecoverable sectors to spare ones </s>
<s> this process marks bad spots so they will not be made available when you partition and format the drive </s>
<s> one small program that s supposed to do miracles is called quot spin rite quot as i recall but it s not free and will cost as much as today s 80 gig drives </s>
<s> reformat that box just grab a legal copy of your favorite os linux or windows and reformat it ll solve all the hastles </s>
