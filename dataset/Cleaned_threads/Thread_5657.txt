<s> sadly i ve been running this piece of junk for far too long it s been about 6 years since i built a computer and i m having some confusion with power supplies now days this is what i m thinking about building mb asus maximus extreme cpu intel core2 quad q6600 ram team xtreem 2gb 240 pin ddr3 1333 pc3 10600 hdd wd raptor x wd1500ahfd 150gb 10k rpm sata150 video asus eah3850 radeon hd3850 x2 i don t know what i m looking for in a psu such as do i need 2 power connectors for both cards etc any help is much appreciated </s>
<s> two radeon hd 3850s will cost at least 280 but won t match the performance of one geforce 8800gts 512 for 270 before 30 rebate </s>
<s> thanks for the tip another question i don t know much about video cards in general i figure i would be able to buy one of those for now later on would i be able to add another one in </s>
<s> or does it have to be cross fire or sli cross fire isn t dependant on motherboard </s>
<s> the asus maximus extreme uses the intel x38 chipset and only supports crossfire with ati amd cards </s>
<s> nvidia sli requires a mobo based on an nvidia chipset </s>
<s> there are hacked nvidia drivers that will enable sli on non nvidia chipsets but i don t recommend that route </s>
<s> if you 280 won t fit in your budget then get a geforce 9600gt about 150 </s>
<s> they re faster than an hd 3850 or hd 3870 </s>
