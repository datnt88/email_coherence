<s> i ve got a couple of related questions </s>
<s> right now i m using an unpartitioned hard drive in my pc </s>
<s> i d like to add a second drive and turn them into a raid1 array i hope i m phrasing that correctly and i d also like to partition the drive using partition magic but i don t want to lose any data </s>
<s> do i need to partition the original drive before i set up the raid array </s>
<s> do i need to set up a matching partition on the second drive or will that be taken care of automatically </s>
<s> does it matter </s>
<s> also do i need to reformat the original drive in order to set up the raid array </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> mirroring </s>
<s> see you may be lost from the beginning since you mention partition magic which would never be used in a raid 1 setup </s>
<s> you didn t supply what raid hardware you have or what os you have that supports raid 1 so i m left to guess that we are working with the most common setup </s>
<s> here s a link about xp pro s raid 1 with ide drives </s>

<s> not good </s>
<s> after 2 decades of watching people with various raid systems raid 1 never paid off </s>
<s> the most common damage to the system was the delete key </s>
<s> the damage was mirrored to the other drive and that was that </s>
<s> same story for corrupted files virus trojan and malware </s>
<s> gt never in 20 years did raid 1 save anyone i know </s>
<s> raid 0 paid off for those that wanted speed and raid 5 for those that wanted better hardware reliability </s>
<s> many attempt raid because they are under the impression it will save them from performing a backup </s>
<s> the lesson about backup appears to be one that many will learn firsthand </s>
