<s> i ve been having this weird problem with my new ati agp video card and now i am thinking it s caused by a conflict there are two radeon drivers installing because windows keeps detecting a secondary one on a pci port </s>
<s> i remove them every time but they keep coming back </s>
<s> i have radeon ati 9700 and it comes with driver installers and software combined cd </s>
<s> the computer relies on windows drivers through the pci until told otherwise </s>
<s> it could be that either you have not installed ati drivers properly or whatever version of ati is in conflict with windows </s>
<s> what does roll back drivers do if you have a version of xp </s>
<s> second i also have ati aiw 9700 pro and in device mgr it always shows two entries by default </s>
<s> if you read through the install text read me file it will explain to you somewhere in it that this is normal </s>
<s> so i would gather that your weird issue isn t related to that and request that you describe what s happening </s>
