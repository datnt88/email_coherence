<s> hi all we have several walkabout hammerhead hh3 tablet pc s </s>
<s> they are at the age now that they won t hold the cmos settings </s>
<s> the company says that they are the only ones who can replace the battery cmos chip and of course rather expensive </s>
<s> i have completely dismantled one and i can t find anything resembling a battery </s>
<s> i thought they might be using a cap but the one i see that is in the package i would expect is being used to filter the backlight </s>
<s> i have looked under battery behind pcmcia slot all around the screen and i am stumped </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> since there is no manual available try this link </s>
<s> since they have 24 of them they may know something </s>
<s> don t be cheap </s>
<s> pay them for the answer </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i appreciate your help and comments keep them coming </s>
