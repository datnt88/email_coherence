<s> hello everybody i have a rather awkward problem most of the times i try to watch a movie in my pc </s>
<s> the moment i insert the dvd disk in and starts to read then all of a sudden the pc automatically restarts </s>
<s> i have a pentium 4 in 3 0 ghz with windows xp home 512 mb ram 80gb hard drive liteon dvd rw and a vga 128mb pci express </s>
<s> the problem doesnt appear in all dvd movies but in the majority of those </s>
<s> with common dvd software content and cds there is no problem at all </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it turned out to be the sound driver </s>
<s> this one had driven many tech insane as all cds worked as well as mp3s and many dvds </s>
<s> i will not dive into the gritty details but the theory is the dvd used the 5 1 stereo portion of the audio driver and that is where i guess the flaw was </s>
<s> finding the latest driver was not easy since it was some oem motherboard by fujitsu siemans </s>
<s> but a little sleuthing and we found it </s>
<s> your issue sounds oh so familiar </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> and yes the microsoft update driver button announced it had the latest drivers </s>
<s> i wonder if they ll ever fix that </s>
<s> if your processor isnt getting enough power from your power supply unit then your system will reboot itself under the strain </s>
<s> p4 3 0ghz cpus draw quite a lot of power so if you continue to have this problem later in life then i would look at upgrading your psu </s>
