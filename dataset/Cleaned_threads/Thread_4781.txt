<s> i read all that thread </s>
<s> very good solutions </s>

<s> i just purchased a wstern digital 120gb usb drive model wd1200u017 001 i like to put my files on this and e mail program </s>

<s> i would like to hook this to couple different computers and access my e mail account and download e mails on this usb drive </s>

<s> bob thanks for the reply </s>
<s> u3 drives are very limited </s>
<s> only available in flash drives max capacity 2 gb </s>
<s> meantime i downloaded thunderbird portable application on one of my 1gb flash drive </s>
<s> on first try it worked fine </s>
<s> no trace of e mails on computer once i removed the drive i am going to use this on other computer and see how it works </s>
<s> if this works fine then i will install it on my portable usb drive </s>
<s> this might be the solution </s>
<s> also if this works i would like to copy all my old e mails from outlook express to the thunderbird portable </s>
<s> any idea on how to do this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you can refine that but it appears to be common web content on exporting and import from and to the various email programs </s>
<s> i don t duplicate such content here but point it out </s>
