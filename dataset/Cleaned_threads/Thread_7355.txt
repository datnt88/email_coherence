<s> i m planning on purchasing a new desktop </s>
<s> i ve always had custom made pc s in the past for gaming etc </s>
<s> i m now past that stage but i still want quality and speed </s>
<s> i plan on basic cable internet surfing photo and movie edits multi task etc </s>
<s> no tv turner </s>
<s> i probably will get a dell or hp with vista home premium </s>
<s> my question to avoid hour glass should i get 2 meg ram and forget about video card get 1 meg ram and a video card or go for it and get 2 meg ram and video card </s>
<s> i m not getting a new monitor but would like to stay in the 1 200 price range </s>
<s> any advice </s>
<s> to change the icon to something other than an hour glass </s>
<s> even the latest and greatest pc will show that if the internet is downloading something </s>
<s> but back to reality </s>
<s> i bet you meant 2 gb gigabyte ram </s>
<s> that s nice for vista </s>
<s> don t get more than that on 32 bit os based machines </s>
<s> as to the video i m going to peg it at 256 mb for desktops </s>
<s> gt the really big item to look for is a dual core cpu </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>

<s> yes i did mean 2 gig ram </s>
<s> any advice on best company for desktop dell hp etc </s>
<s> not sure if some of them use lousy motherboard burners etc </s>
<s> will size of power suppy matter perhaps 350 watts </s>
<s> the price we pay for these drives is under 40 bucks and get 2 or so year lifespans </s>
<s> most accept this because when they lasted years the price was in the hundreds of dollars </s>
<s> because of such low prices the highend models are never seen today </s>
<s> as to make i use the dell without issue at the office </s>
<s> the retail hp compaq aren t so bad either </s>
