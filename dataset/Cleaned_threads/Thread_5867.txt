<s> i hope someone can help me make sense of this </s>
<s> i seemingly lost four external hard drives within hours of eachother </s>
<s> for simplicity will limit the scenario to two for the moment lacie 1 and lacie 2 initial event lacie 1 external i accidently used a different power supply adapter when trying to start lacie 1 external </s>
<s> the one i used had slightly different amp output </s>
<s> stupid mistake the lacie 1 external power light flickered for just a moment then went out </s>
<s> the drive never spun up nor made a sound </s>
<s> result lacie 1 external would not turn on </s>
<s> i had an identical lacie external lacie 2 so i thought i might try using that to recover data from the failed lacie 1 drive </s>
<s> secondary event lacie 2 external i tested lacie 2 external with proper power adapter </s>
<s> it powered up normally </s>
<s> so i removed the hard drive from lacie 1 housing and installed it into lacie 2 housing </s>
<s> then i tested lacie 2 external with proper power adapter </s>
<s> lacie 2 light flickered then went out </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> i assumed it failed to read drive 1 which must be corrupted </s>
<s> so removed hard drive 1 from lacie 2 housing and reinstalled drive 2 into it s original lacie 2 housing </s>
<s> tested lacie 2 again with proper power adapter </s>
<s> now lacie 2 would not power up at all where it just worked fine two steps ago </s>
<s> final result lacie 2 failure </s>
<s> what happened here </s>
<s> i understand how the initial event for lacie 1 could cause failure in both drive 1 and or the lacie housing 1 but how could that lead to the second event failure in lacie 2 </s>
<s> is it possible that the bad drive from 1 somehow corrupted the lacie 2 housing power </s>
<s> how is that possible </s>
<s> and since drive 2 was outside of it s housing when the failure occurred in lacie 2 does that mean drive 2 is most likely healthy </s>
<s> any advice is much appreciated </s>
<s> but look at the top of this forum sticky quot lost and found quot for the lacie miracle </s>
<s> too bad they didn t standardize power plugs in this industry </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it is my guess that at the least i fried the logic board of the drive </s>
<s> at this point it does not seem to respond to power period </s>
<s> so i am buying a used drive same model same firmware and going to try and swap that logic board onto my lacie 1 drive </s>
<s> question though what should i hook it up to from there </s>
<s> can i simply plug the drive into an ata ultra compatible pc and let the computer try to recognizie it </s>
<s> because it was a standalone drive in the lacie is there any kind of boot partitions configurations on the drive for the lacie that might cause the pc to not recognize it </s>
<s> this is beyond my pay grade but i want to give it a shot and save the of having some recovery firm do the work </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> explains how they got the data out </s>
<s> as to hooking up drives to pcs that has to be something we see on too many web pages </s>
<s> try reading a few more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> stayed up late last night and worked it out </s>
<s> here s what most likely happened </s>
<s> 1 when powering on lacie 1 with the the bad adapter it instantly fried both the 1 housing logic board as well as the installed 1 hard drive logic board </s>
<s> 2 when i swapped in bad 1 drive into lacie 2 housing and tried to power it up the bad drive somehow fed back it s power failure into the lacie 2 logic board frying it as well </s>
<s> i still don t understand why this was the case why didn t it just fail to read the bad drive </s>
<s> talkin bout a widow maker for anyone counting that s 3 logic boards down </s>
<s> 3 my hunch was correct about drive 2 being healthy </s>
<s> it was out of the housing when lacie 2 housing fried </s>
<s> when i reinstalled 2 drive back into the 2 housing the housing logic board was dead so could not pass on any further failures to the 2 drive </s>
<s> 4 in answer to my own question about how to get a pc wxp box to read the former lacie 2 ata drive all i had to do was remove a jumper on the drive making it a slave drive </s>
<s> once i did that my pc read the disc 100 with all the old lacie formatting partitions etc </s>
<s> 5 as previously posted my drive 1 was not running when it fried it just failed to power up so i was almost certain all my data physical disc and heads were healthy </s>
<s> it was just the power </s>
<s> i stumbled upon a great website can swapping logic boards be that easy </s>
<s> and just so happens i had a torx socket sitting in my mini computer kit unused for the last 20 years so i popped off the healthy 2 drive logic board and installed it on the 1 drive plugged that into my pc wxp box and woohoo there s all my 320gb of data </s>
<s> i had recovered my own hard drive </s>
<s> the local data recovery shakedown joint was ready to charge me over a grand per drive i m sure they would have too despite it actually being an easy fix especially for experts in the field this would have been nothing </s>
<s> 6 i found a matching model firmware drive on ebay cheap sectors are bad but all i need from it is the healthy logic board so i will swap that in for the burnt out board on drive 1 recall i actually had four total drives go down so still have to find another cheap matching logic board for drive 3 </s>
<s> 7 that leaves me sitting with four worthless lacie housing shells all apparently with burt out logic boards of their own </s>
<s> plus i have to find permanent networked new housing for the four hard drives </s>
<s> i don t want a whole new pc just for that </s>
<s> what to buy </s>
<s> can i call it a game </s>
<s> well it is a puzzle which is a game so let s share what i tried in the past </s>
<s> 1 server </s>
<s> any old pc can be a server </s>
<s> upside many are free </s>
<s> downside all of them seem to draw 100 watts </s>
<s> 2 a simple server like upside found for 25 bucks </s>
<s> downside not too speedy </s>
<s> lesson not a single small nas is what i call fast </s>
<s> the issue is the link </s>
<s> it s all of 100 megabit usb 2 is 480 and sata is 1500 megabit </s>
<s> 3 next up </s>
<s> a netbook </s>
<s> walmart has a 228 buck netbook </s>
<s> might be the cure to item 1 bob </s>
<s> 1 as long as the quot old quot bios supports drives in the 300gb range yes </s>
<s> i imagine most would </s>
<s> 2 this would be more for long term storage rather than speedy serve backs </s>
<s> soooooo i could live with those slower speeds </s>
<s> i actually have a new unpacked hp ex495 intended to be used as a media server for music video etc to my networked home devices </s>
<s> i quickly glanced at the manual last night says it wants to reformat any new drive to become part of the server </s>
<s> will it really not let me add a pre formatted drive with content </s>
<s> i should take a second look </s>
<s> 3 netbook i m confused </s>
<s> how will my four raw drives fit into that housing </s>
<s> are you suggesting i buy new individual external housing for the drives and cable them in via usb fw </s>
<s> i have the black unit and it can do a jobd raid read mine has a pair of 50 buck 750gb drives </s>
<s> upside cheap 1 5gb usb drive </s>
<s> downside a little noisy </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that looks promising </s>
<s> all four existing disks are stuffed full of content and if possible i want them to stay that way reformatting into an jbod raid or other array is not mandatory with that hardware is it </s>
<s> i will take a closer look </s>
<s> appreciate the tips bob </s>
<s> j </s>
<s> i like the freegene concept </s>
<s> have a 25 newegg gift card burning a whole in my pocket however so will try out the eagle branded version </s>
<s> the drive arrived with almost zero documentation and in the dual drive two drive letters show up mode </s>
<s> since i wanted it to be a clone of another 1 5tb drive for cheap this is why i moved the jumper </s>
<s> now i m back to the my 3 copies to achieve some reliable backup system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> newegg survey says the fan on that eagle is worthless will die in a matter of months </s>
<s> any issues like that w the freegene </s>
<s> so i can t speak about longevity </s>
<s> it runs about 2 hours when i sync the systems and then it s back to the storage bin for safety </s>
<s> i read the newegg review and since i m handy with drill presses wires solder and more i think it is fixable </s>
<s> or like one wrote they leave the cover off </s>
