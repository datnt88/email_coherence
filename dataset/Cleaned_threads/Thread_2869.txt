<s> hi when i first bought my 100gb maxtor external hard drive for my desktop dell i plugged it in set it up correctly but couldn t locate it </s>
<s> after researching i found on this site a link i followed that i think i can t really remember i downloaded something wich located this new drive </s>
<s> i just moved my room around unplugging everything and now i again can t locate my drive </s>
<s> i don t want to reformat it b c i have everything saved on it </s>
<s> can anyone help me locate it again </s>
<s> thanks al </s>
<s> i hooked the maxtor up to my dell laptop copied that archive then hooked it up to my desktop </s>
<s> i am running xp pro on a pentium with c drive and 2 dvd drives d and e </s>
<s> the system found it and labelled it as f so far so good created an archive directory copied 4 folders then had to wander off </s>
<s> when restarted the desktop can no longer find drive f the maxtor </s>
<s> bummer </s>
<s> oh yeah if i power up with the maxtor attached to a usb port the system hangs in post double bummer </s>
<s> have you too been thinking about getting an archival portable drive </s>
<s> was told check to see what type of usb connection you have in device manager </s>
<s> in the universal serial bus connection section look for the intel 82801 chipset </s>
<s> if you have this chipset you will have communication issues with the ps 3100 there is a hardware conflict with this particular chipset and the ps 3100 there are two possible solutions to this problem </s>
<s> you may purchase a usb cardbus adapter card install it and connect the drive through that usb connection and the drive will work fine </s>
<s> the alternative would be to replace the drive with any other maxtor drive model other than the ps 3100 </s>
