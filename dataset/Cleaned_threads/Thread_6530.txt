<s> hi i m new here and not too network savvy </s>
<s> i m trying to go wireless with a desktop pc running windows xp sp2 </s>
<s> i ve got a 2wire router which works fine when plugged into the computer via an ethernet cable </s>
<s> i purchased a netgear n300 wireless usb adapter and installed it it seems to be working fine </s>
<s> the trouble is that my wireless connection shows quot limited or no connectivity quot although the signal strength is quot very good quot when i try to repair the connection it tells me that i could not be assigned an ip address </s>
<s> at the moment i m working via the ethernet cable with no difficulty </s>
<s> can someone suggest a reason why the wired connection works but the wireless from the same router doesn t even though it should </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help </s>
<s> it could be that the os is out of date sp3 has been out for years and many drivers expect it </s>
<s> you never revealed if it ever worked </s>
<s> i now that setup can be horrible and today s users are not ready for this old thing </s>
<s> tell more </s>
<s> such as if you tried it within 10 feet of the un named and untold settings router </s>
<s> for example i do not expect it to work if the ssid is hidden </s>
<s> i also expect this to fail if the ethernet is plugged in if the ethernet ip settings were set manually and if the ip addresses are still around when you try the wifi </s>
<s> lots to consider </s>
<s> lots of things today s owners have reason to move away from this old thing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> router and adapter are in the same room about 6 feet apart </s>
<s> router has always worked previously just using ethernet cable </s>
<s> but i ve never tried it wirelessly before </s>
<s> ssid broadcast is enabled </s>
<s> router is a 2wire 2701hb g if i understand you you re saying that you don t expect the wireless adapter to work if my ethernet cable is also plugged in </s>
<s> if the ethernet is plugged in the ip assigned there is on the same lan as what the wifi will try to get assigned </s>
<s> so if you recall your basic network classes you can t have 2 interfaces on the same lan well without a lot of work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but i eventually had to take it to an it pro for some other issues so i m having the network issue addressed at the same time </s>
<s> i appreciate your help </s>
<s> if your wired connection works fine but not your wireless then you can eliminate your modem and you wired lan settings </s>
<s> i would take a look at my wireless lan settings make sure it s set to dhcp and check out what range you have it set to </s>
<s> if you get that message see if you can ping your default gateway </s>
