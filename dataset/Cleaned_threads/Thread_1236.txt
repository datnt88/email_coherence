<s> system details hp pavilion m8400f amd phenom 9500 quad core processor 3 00 gb ram nvidia geforce 8500 gt ecs mcp61pm hm motherboard vista 32 bit home basic a couple of months ago i began to experience periodic bsods </s>
<s> i updated my drivers vista and nvidia don t play nice scanned for viruses malware none found the usual culprits </s>
<s> everything seemed fine for a while </s>
<s> then recently the bsods became recurrent occurring almost every time i booted up though sometimes everything would still run smoothly </s>
<s> i ran multiple stress tests on the hardware and had a tech do the same </s>
<s> it all passed so i figured something had corrupted the os </s>
<s> i ran a complete factory reset but after that finished the os wouldn t configure </s>
<s> it errors out with a quot code purple quot every time </s>
<s> i spoke with a rep from hp who advised me to reset bios by reseating the cmos battery </s>
<s> that didn t work and either did resetting the defaults within bios </s>
<s> that rep then suggested i bring the computer into one of their authorized techs at walmart or office depot to update the bios manually for cheap </s>
<s> techs in my area won t touch it i guess out of liability concerns about ruining the motherboard </s>
<s> they ll only send it off to quot central repair quot for 300 </s>
<s> tonight i then spoke with another hp rep who indicated that my motherboard is actually going has gone bad if reseating the cmos battery didn t work </s>
<s> she said they need to quot repair the dmi utility of the motherboard stored in the bios quot cost 199 plus the cost of a new motherboard if they can t repair the old one </s>
<s> so my question is does either diagnosis sound correct </s>
<s> could the recovery partition have become corrupted instead in which case i m at a loss </s>
<s> i can follow a guide and update the bios myself if needed but i don t want to waste my time and risk damaging the rest of the hardware if the board is toast </s>
<s> if it is i plan on salvaging the working parts to upgrade my wife s desktop </s>
<s> sorry for the wall of text but i wanted to make sure the case was clear </s>
<s> thanks for your time </s>
<s> matt </s>
<s> more often than not is the result of unrecoverable memory errors which could be due to the dimms or the memory controller in the amd </s>
<s> have you tried reseating the dimms and since you have 3gb tried operating only with the 2gb stick </s>
<s> if you are close to a computer store get a known good dimm to verify </s>
<s> forget repair services a generic version of the mcp61p is about 50 but the back i o may be slightly different and replacing the mobo yourself means dealing with vista re activation not impossible but not everyone likes dealing with it </s>
<s> if the recovery partition is corrupted ask hp to ship you vista oem not recovery cds </s>
<s> if you don t like messing with hardware replace the pc </s>
<s> for value a new pc with w7 and better cpus than the 9500 can t be beat </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> it wasn t the dimms or a corruption in the partition </s>
<s> looks like the mobo is the culprit after all </s>
<s> i ll be salvaging the rest of the parts for various upgrades on other household comps and ordering something new with windows 7 thanks for the advice </s>
<s> much appreciated </s>
