<s> hi i ve got 2 two rooms each with 2 computers and a wired ethernet hub interconnected by an ethernet cable </s>
<s> i use dial up from one computer and do not have broadband cable or dsl nor am i really interested in getting either in the near future </s>
<s> i just got a wi fi capable laptop and thought i d get acquainted with wi fi access to my wired network </s>
<s> my first thought was getting a wireless access point say a linksys wap54g but now i m confused </s>
<s> a router say a linksys wrt54g seems to have more functionality 1 a wap 2 a hub with 4 ethernet ports </s>
<s> 3 a cable dsl router for less money as opposed to a wap with only 1 ethernet port </s>
<s> am i missing something </s>
<s> can i really replace a wired hub with the wrt54g and get wired hub functionality and wireless access to my wired network </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> its very simple </s>
<s> if you have a router you can add a wap </s>
<s> if not router the the combo router wap costs less </s>
<s> i m using a 37 dollar dlink wifig from compgeeks for now so i wonder how much cheaper you can go </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> just checking so i can replace a wired hub with a say linksys wrt54g router even tho i currently use dial up and won t use broadband or dsl access the wired network is only used basically for back ups and will be able to talk to the other wired hub and all other wired computers via wirewless from my new wi fi enabled laptop via the router </s>
<s> regards tom </s>
<s> in that case you don t want a wifi router </s>
<s> you would setup ics or such on a host machine then run that host s ethernet to some switched hub and then wire an ethernet wap to the switched hub </s>
<s> sorry if i missed you were on dialup </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob no you didn t miss anything </s>
<s> i could have clarified better </s>
<s> for now i m perfectly content with dial up </s>
<s> and for now i would only want to use the router as a hub for my wired network and as a wap to connect my new wi fi enabled laptop wirelessly to since i basically just use the wired network now for backups </s>
<s> but down the road i would still have the router functionality once i decide to get broadband cable or dsl </s>
<s> re dial up internet access for grins i occasionally run pcanywhere host on one computer to connect to the internet and then browse from another pcanywhere client computer via the wired network </s>
<s> kludgey and not exactly super fast but it works </s>
<s> of course until i get broadband cable or dsl i ll probably also want to try this wirelessly for grins </s>
<s> many thanks tom </s>
