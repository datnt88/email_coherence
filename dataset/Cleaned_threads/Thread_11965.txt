<s> i am having some trouble setting up a network for my neightbor </s>
<s> both computers are running xp one home one pro </s>
<s> i ahve gone through the network setup wizard on both of them </s>
<s> i dont know which configuration to choose so i just picked one </s>
<s> i think it was the defalut that comes up </s>
<s> i entered in all of the info and it said it was done and that i ahd to restart </s>
<s> so i did </s>
<s> i also did this on the other which connects via 802 11b </s>
<s> i went to my network places and tried to view the workgroup computers </s>
<s> each time i received a dialog box that said i couldn t access the network </s>
<s> it said that a server hadn t been secified </s>
<s> the internet works fine on both of them by the way </s>
<s> i have done other posts in the past and i have not provided enough info </s>
<s> if you need anymore </s>
<s> please let me know </s>
<s> name they both should be the same </s>
<s> turn off the firewalls until the lan is working </s>
<s> quot it said that a server hadn t been secified quot this sounds suspiciously like a domain had been set </s>
<s> the workgroup names are both the same </s>
<s> i pretty sure that i didn t set up a domain in the first place </s>
<s> just a refresher put what is the domain again </s>
<s> on the computer name tab your workgroup name or the domain you belong to will be shown </s>
<s> if a domain name is listed you can change by clicking the change button and switch to a workgroup </s>
<s> well in order to do that you would have to be able to view the workgroup computers right </s>
<s> i think well thats when i get the error message </s>
<s> it comes up when i click quot view workgroup computers quot i came home and i did what you have just explained wheere your click on the name and click on properties so i think i know what your saying </s>
<s> i am going over to their house tomorrow to look at it again </s>
