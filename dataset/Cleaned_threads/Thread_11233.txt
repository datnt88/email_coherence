<s> hi everyone i have been given a toshiba satellite l30 101 lap top which i have been told if i can fix it i can keep it </s>
<s> the laptop has a broken screen so every time it is switched on most of the screen is covered in black and all you can see is the surrounding parts </s>
<s> what i would like to know is if there is any way that this can be fixed without replacing the screen </s>
<s> i havn t managed to do anything other then connect it to an external monitor which is not practical for what i need it for and search online for a new screen a new screen is very expensive so if i can fix it that would be amazing </s>
<s> if anyone knows if this is possible it s you guys as you have helped me a lot over the past few months with other computer problems thanks all paul </s>
<s> the top post contains information about testing the ccfl power supply </s>
<s> do that first </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have done the checks to help start windows as specified in the first post of this forum but it hasn t fixed the issue </s>
<s> a friend of mine tells me that it sounds like the monitor has bled or has smashed and as far as he is aware this isn t fixable but needs replacing would this be true </s>
<s> paul </s>
<s> if there s evidence of physical damage you have no option but to replace the damaged part </s>
<s> if there is no backlight it s the ccf tube or it s high voltage supply </s>
<s> you can replace the power supply component quite easily </s>
<s> this is often called and inverter and should got for 30 to 50 bucks </s>
<s> if the ccf tube is bad it s usually embedded in to screen assembly and you change the screen </s>
<s> there is also a ribbon cable that passes from the screen to the main board </s>
<s> these flex and can break </s>
<s> they are sometimes part of the screen assembly and not detachable so you replace the screen </s>
<s> if you go the screen route you will want the manufacturer s part number as these vary from machine to machine and model to model within the family </s>
<s> it should be somewhere on the back of the screen </s>
<s> you ll need some precision tools skill to use them and some patience to figure out how to get these off without doing further damage </s>
<s> your comfort level with doing this is important </s>
<s> to have this done by one in the business of doing so will cost at least 3x what it will cost to do it yourself </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> thanks for all that information that has really helped </s>
