<s> whats is the recommended app for remote desktop </s>
<s> i tried using pocketcloud free edition but the desktop redraw is kinda slow and no sound </s>
<s> also the pro ver is too expensive i mainly use it view desktop no gaming so i guess i want about 5 fps is it to much </s>
<s> anyone tried airplay </s>
<s> i am using window 7 64 bit and 400 kilobytes s broadband if possible i want to use the local wifi wireless router to collect meaning dont use bandwidth since 400kb s is kinda slow for high fps i guess </s>
<s> i can only guess this is your first encounter with that technology but not one remote desktop i ve seen comes close to what you get on the real machine </s>
<s> in fact the reason for such access is pretty simple </s>
<s> to get at the desktop for the things you can t do on the other machine </s>
<s> for me i use it to grab a file i forgot and when done i m back to my machine </s>
<s> if you see over 1 fps that s pretty normal </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i like and use splashtop </s>
<s> i have android but it s also available for mac </s>
<s> they do have a separate app for ipad </s>
<s> they have an app for just about every os even the hp touchpad </s>
<s> i can t quite remember since i got it last year so not sure if it s free or not </s>
<s> i think the best might be teamviewer </s>
<s> i also have this installed i installed this one so that i can remote into my family member s pc when they have problems </s>
<s> i can look around their system and fix things </s>
<s> i believe you can even reboot the pc remotely </s>
<s> i tested it out already and it loaded very quickly and using it very impressive </s>
<s> moving around is very fast </s>
<s> i am guessing you could probably remote into your own pc but i haven t tried this yet </s>
<s> it s one of the best apps for remote pc help </s>
<s> it is also free for private use </s>
<s> if you are a business then you have to pay for it </s>
<s> i know it works for mac and i believe they have a dedicated ipad app as well </s>
<s> i really dont remember but there is an inbuilt remot app on your mac </s>
