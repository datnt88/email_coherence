<s> hi all i m going to be upgrading my mobo to an asus a8n sli premium nvidia </s>
<s> this board seems to fit my needs for gaming but i prefer ati crossfire gpu my gut feeling is that while both use pcie16 that nvidia sli ready board won t allow the ati card to work properly </s>
<s> not that nvidia isn t a great card it s really just preference if i had to i would use nvidia </s>
<s> i ll be running an amd athlon 64 x2 4800 with 2 gigs of dual channel ddr2 ram </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> it is possible to run ati x fire on an sli motherboard through driver hacks and the like </s>
<s> even though it can be done i wouldn t attempt it </s>
<s> a single ati card will work fine on an sli motheboard though </s>
<s> if you want x fire why not just get an x fire board </s>
<s> also i wasn t aware that amd made an x2 4800 for socket am2 </s>
<s> maybe i read it wrong but the mobo i was looking at was a 939 socket now i m wondering </s>
<s> so you re cool </s>
<s> like nathan said if you want to use 2 radeons faster than x1600pro then get a crossfire ati chipset motherboard </s>
<s> i ve always had good luck building from the ground up with asus mobo s all the one s that i ve seen with a 939 socket were sli ready unless maybe nathan was right about this that crossfire ready was only for am2 socket that s possible gotta go to tiger d and check that </s>
<s> teach me how to wallhack please _ </s>
