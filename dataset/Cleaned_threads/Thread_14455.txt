<s> my 3 year old emach is dead </s>
<s> when i turn it on hard drive access light stays on power supply fan runs small fan on heatsink does not will turn freeley by hand </s>
<s> i liked my old emach so i purchased a new one model t5010 </s>
<s> i do not want to donate or give my old one away as it has a lot of personal info on hard drive </s>
<s> i can not transfer the info to my new one as it has a sticker on the cover that if broken voids the warranty </s>
<s> should i take the hard drive cd and two 256 merory sticks out and throw the rest in the trash </s>
<s> all you have to do is take out the hdd of the old computer and use a kit to make it a usb hdd case </s>
<s> after you transfer your important files i d format it and use it as a back up drive or wipe it with any free programs like bcwipe and dispose of it </s>
<s> i have an old system with spyware but i still want to use it </s>
<s> you can take the memory and add it to your surrent computer given it s the right format you can build a totally new machine with your parts </s>
<s> get a new motherboard a new case and use the parts in your dead emach like hdd memory optical drive and before you know it you have a brand new computer </s>
<s> what everyone forgot to mention here was the fact that emachies has a shutdown temp control in the bios and if your cpu gets to hot it won t boot or function </s>
<s> replace the cpu fan for fifteen twenty bucks it will recognize the fan is going temp down and it may run again </s>
<s> i own one so i know replaced my fan had same problem </s>
<s> there is a chance the cpu is dead but i would try it </s>
<s> good luck paul </s>
