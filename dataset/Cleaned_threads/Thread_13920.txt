<s> i just upgraded my motherboard to a pc chips m863g and i m having some trouble with it getting to boot </s>
<s> in short there is no booting </s>
<s> no beeping no flashing so then there s most likely a short about </s>
<s> the last time i tried to install a motherboard i had this exact problem </s>
<s> i ended up taking it to a technician and when he fixed it up and i asked him what the problem was he told me that something to the effect of my cpu clock being off sync with my fsb or something </s>
<s> to this day i have no idea how to adjust that setting on the motherboard and i m becoming pretty frustrated </s>
<s> the manual is total garbage </s>
<s> and if anyone already has had experience with this board i did plug in the 4 pin power plug as well as adjusted the cmos jumper </s>
<s> specs proc amd athlon xp 2400 ram kingston ddr400 512mb gpu nvidia geforce 5500 fx plus a lite on cd dvd drive and another atapi dvd drive and two running virtual drives </s>
<s> seems that you did what i had to do with four of them to get the supply to turn on </s>
<s> they all came with the cmos jumper in the wrong position </s>
<s> in the case of these the manul showed the positions correctly just that the mobos shipped with the jumper in the wiring position </s>
<s> one thing common to putting new mobo in old case is to miss the fact that there is a hex standoff left on the mounting plate that does not line up with the new mobos plated ring mounting holes </s>
<s> this results in shorting the artwork on the bottom layer of the mobo </s>
<s> lay it on a piece of cardboard with ony cpu hsf memory </s>
<s> plug the supply in and use the tip of a small slot screwdriver to momentarily short the two power on pins on the mobo togeter </s>
<s> the power supply should turn on and stay on until you short the pins again possibly for 4 or 5 seconds </s>
<s> btw way this should work with a brand new mobo with nothing added </s>
<s> should work right out of the box </s>
<s> pressing the on off switch repeatedly </s>
<s> that worked for me yesterday </s>
<s> i bought a mobo and put everything in and when i pressed the power button nothign happened </s>
<s> i thought somethign was wrong so i kept flcking the power supply switch on off while keep pressing the power button and my mobo turned on </s>
<s> i bit the bullet and took it to the geek squad </s>
<s> a guy that looks like elliot smith took all of 10 minute to diagnose it </s>
<s> as it turned out the little power reset leds were miscolored </s>
<s> d oh </s>
<s> thanks for the help though </s>
<s> you guys do a good thing here </s>
