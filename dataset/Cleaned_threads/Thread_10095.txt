<s> i recently purchased comcast internet specifically the quot performance quot package 25 mbps </s>
<s> i purchased an approved modem motorola surfboard sb6141 and a router medialink wireless n 300 mbps </s>
<s> my problem has me so mind boggled that i m flipping out my speeds are slower when wired to the router pc gt modem versus wired directly to the modem pc gt router gt modem </s>
<s> here s the rub regardless of whether i am wired directly into the modem or wired to the router i get 25 mbps when i go to speedtest net </s>
<s> how could that be </s>
<s> i thought maybe it was in my head maybe it was psychological but i tested it time and time again </s>
<s> for example when streaming video while connected to the modem i can pause the video and it buffers very fast </s>
<s> but when i m connected to the router it buffers about 1 10 of the speed </s>
<s> yet speedtest net is saying they are both maxing out at 25 mbps </s>
<s> the ping rate is the same too </s>
<s> wtf </s>
<s> how could that possibly be </s>
<s> i tested this 20 times with the same video and got the same result each time </s>
<s> i also tried changing cables and power cycling but that doesn t make a difference </s>
<s> did i get a bad router </s>
<s> i also tried connecting to the router wirelessly </s>
<s> while speedtest net shows a slightly slower speed i e 20 mpbs the buffering on streaming video is still ungodly slow </s>
<s> why is this happening </s>
<s> someone please help me before i rip all my hair out </s>
<s> it s not surprising </s>
<s> look for reviews on this router and some say it s not so hot </s>

<s> i acknowledge that bad review but i purchased that router precisely because it had the highest rating on amazon </s>
<s> do you have another suggested router </s>
<s> but be sure of your return privileges </s>
<s> call the support and see what they offer </s>
<s> and my trick </s>
<s> always try this with the wifi off and the target in the dmz </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> seems happy but your story actually makes sense </s>
<s> it s a delicate play on tcp ip windowing and software </s>
<s> i ll definitely try with wireless turned off on the router i ll have to figure out how to do that </s>
<s> as for dmz </s>
<s> a setting or entry by name is what we use </s>
<s> i m surprised this router didn t note the dmz entry </s>
<s> maybe it s for mass consumption and not for folk that need to do more than the usual </s>
<s> this means no i didn t read this router s manual </s>
<s> mostly because all have had the dmz feature </s>
<s> is this a first </s>
<s> a router without such </s>
