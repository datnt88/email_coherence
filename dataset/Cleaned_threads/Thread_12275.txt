<s> i have a motorola surfboard 6580 as my cable modem router 802 11n ap </s>
<s> i wanted to add an ap on the second floor of the house for better signal </s>
<s> i have read that aps from different manuafacturers are not necessarily compatible for seamless roaming </s>
<s> i just want to see if anyone has experiences on it </s>
<s> well i guess the worst case is to turn off wifi on the surfboard and get 2 identical aps but that s not ideal </s>
<s> thanks for any suggestions </s>
<s> since i only see seamless roaming work in the labs you may my attention here </s>
<s> love to hear if you succeeded </s>

<s> it s interesting to read that this is far from seamless </s>
<s> that is while we can roam any connection is lost as we move from one hotspot to another </s>
<s> you are dealing with a msft os so is this level of seamless acceptable </s>
