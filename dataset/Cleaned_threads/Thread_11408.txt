<s> i am seeing an interesting phenomenon with my wireless network </s>
<s> i have a w2k box set up to perform 802 1x authentication for my wireless network using eap tls </s>
<s> for authentication type i have use smart card or certificate and have both the user cert and to root ca cert installed </s>
<s> when i check the validate server certificate option the connection fails and i get an entry in event viewer on the w2k boc idicating an invalid user name or password </s>
<s> when i leave the box unchecked i connect just fine </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> i have some cards that won t connect under some settings and when i call it in they finally replied with a quot yes we ll have to fix that quot have you contacted the people that supplied the drivers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob i was hopping you were out there perusing the posts </s>
<s> yes i have contacted linksys and they re looking into it </s>
<s> they have actually been pretty responsive on this issue but no cure yet </s>
<s> i was hopping you might have some ideas but if it s a driver issue i m stuck till they fix it </s>
<s> rob </s>
<s> sadly they came back with a quot don t do that quot and no date on the fix </s>
<s> so you can guess the answer </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> unforyunately not being able to validate the cert does create a bit of a vulnerability </s>
<s> if this is just to keep others off your wifi why not just wpa or wpa2 </s>
<s> there is no crack worth noting here that doesn t take an armada of machines to break into </s>
<s> one has to declare a goal </s>
<s> ours was simple </s>
<s> security that was strong enough and we could expect to work for a month at a time when we change wifi wpa passwords </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am using wpa2 in enterprise mode and you are right the vulnerability that i am talking about would be exceeding difficult to exploit someone would have to do a black bag job on my residence which isn t real likely so i m not overly concerned about it </s>
<s> i m just one of those folks that if i know of a security hole i like to plug it </s>
<s> when we need that we use this gt so far no one has detected it </s>
<s> they seem fixated on software solutions </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that s a slick little device </s>
<s> the attack i was specifically a type of mitm attack against eap tls and peap where an attacker gets between the client and the ap </s>
<s> during the initial phases the attacker sends the client a bogus cert </s>
<s> if the client is not required to validate the cert then it blindly accepts the cert and authenticates with the bogus set up </s>
<s> the attacker can then relay to the actual server and authenticate on to the wireless network </s>
<s> the attacker is now in a position to intercept and decrypt all traffic between the client and the real ap </s>
<s> this is a fairly sophisticated attack that would be difficult to mount against a setup like mine and there are ways to ensure that you are on the right network but in an environment where you have a wireless network spanning multiple buildings this could be a cause for concern </s>
