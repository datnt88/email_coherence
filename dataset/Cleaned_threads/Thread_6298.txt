<s> just got a wireless notebook acer5044 windows xp </s>
<s> can sense and connect to wireless networks ok but then how do i find files on the other pc also windows xp with a usb dongle wireless 802 11g </s>
<s> and i am sensing a friends lap top 10 miles away from it the laptops were a few feet away from eachother earlier in the day is this some weird memory glitch </s>
<s> the simplest thing to do is to get a wireless g router </s>
<s> the router is an efficient way to connect computers to form a network </s>
<s> after connecting with a network cable or wirelessly you need set up file and printer sharing to transfer files and share printers over your new network </s>
<s> it s in help and support in your start menu </s>
<s> also that network can in turn be connected to some type of internet service through a broadband modem </s>
<s> this enables all computers to share the internet service </s>
<s> internet broadband modem wireless g router gt gt gt computers key wired gt gt gt wired and or wireless another option is to connect the computers directly to one another via their wireless network adapters </s>
<s> google ad hoc wireless network </s>
<s> you can also form an ad hoc network by connecting them with a crossover network cable </s>
<s> both of thes ad hoc network options are more complicated than just getting a wireless g router </s>
<s> you don t sense the laptop that is 10 miles away </s>
<s> you just see the connection profile that is stored in your computer because the computer sensed it or connected to it earlier </s>
<s> thanks think ill go th router way found these for future readers also sure is nice to find aswers so fast </s>
