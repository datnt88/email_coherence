<s> we are on the verge of migrating from small business server 4 5 to small business server 2003 the new server and accounts are all setup </s>
<s> both servers the old 4 5 and the new 2003 exist on the network with unique domain names for now so i can test without disrupting others </s>
<s> to test if individual workstations get changed without problems we want to be able to have the ability to log into either domain at signup </s>
<s> with the few windows 98 se computers we have left this is easy you can change the domain name and type in whatever you want at login and i can easily test them </s>
<s> but with the windows xp pro computers it is much more complicated it seems </s>
<s> at logon you have the option of logging into computername this computer where computername would be replaced with the name for the computer or to a single domain </s>
<s> when i do the xp process of adding the computer to a new domain after the reboot i only have the option of this computer or the new domain not the old domain anymore </s>
<s> so when my test is done to have it re link back to the old domain i have to go through the whole process all over again </s>
<s> besides being a chore to go back and forth like this it has proven a bit dangerous </s>
<s> on one computer i tried it on a couple of times there eventually was an error generated when trying to connect to the new domain for a 2nd test </s>
<s> after that the computer refused to log into anything even into just itself insisted on a password for administrator even though one wasn t required for it before and we eventually had to get the data off this computer s c drive we were able to and then do a reformat reinstall of win xp since we couldn t log in </s>
<s> on another computer after doing this a couple of times it wouldn t boot anymore because it said that hal dll became corrupted </s>
<s> i was able to fix this with recovery console but it was rather onerous </s>
<s> so i have two questions 1 is there any way to make the xp computers so i can choose at logon one or the other domain </s>
<s> 2 why would problems like the hal dll issue occur </s>
<s> is it bad to keep joining back and forth between 2 domains we wouldn t do this once the new server is quot live quot but i don t want to just change all the workstations one night and if there are immediate unforeseen problems the next morning people can t work for awhile because it is long and problematic to quot go back quot </s>
<s> any help would be much appreciated thanks </s>
<s> 1 i d try out netswitcher com to see if that helps </s>
<s> 2 i ll write yes </s>
<s> your posts seem to indicate you have a lot of home made machines l you don t want to know how many i see the os installed proper </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ll try netswitcher </s>
<s> someone else i talked to recommended starting over using what s at sbsmigration com as well </s>
<s> we ll see </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
