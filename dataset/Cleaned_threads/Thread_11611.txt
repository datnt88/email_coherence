<s> i bought a t23 2647 laptop a while ago </s>
<s> everything worked perfectly untill i found out that i had no graphics card </s>
<s> i used the dxdiag run program to search for my device and there it said quot n a quot i looked around my c drive for a bit and i found ati and s3 savage drivers in my video drivers folder could it be that it doesnt recognize my device </s>
<s> or did the guy who sold it to me take it out before he sold it to me </s>
<s> i dont really wanna take appart my laptop but if anyone has instructions in how to do so i would unwilling look for my graphics card </s>
<s> at least 99 99 of them </s>
<s> the graphics quot chips quot are on the mainboard to save space </s>
<s> you found your video chipset so what is the next issue </s>
<s> i wonder if you are looking for the video driver you didn t tell </s>
<s> if so it s at ibm com or lenovo com bob </s>
<s> ati s3 this thread untracked </s>
<s> that laptop uses s3 savage graphic chip and i don t think it has any dx8 9 capabilities </s>
<s> thus from dxdiag s standpoint the laptop has no graphics card </s>
