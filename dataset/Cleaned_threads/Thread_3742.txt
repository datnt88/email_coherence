<s> speed touch 10 100 adsl modem zyxel prestige 600 series router lucent cell pipe zyxel zywall internet security gateway this wireless system defaults to the standard hard wire adsl line with telenor of norway nearly all the time </s>
<s> when i reset the routers everything on the wireless system works for a while then falls to default again </s>
<s> the 2 office locations are about 100 meters from each other </s>
<s> one of the wireless routers is located midway between both offices and still we fall to defaults with the hard wire </s>
<s> a civil engineer said we may be in a quot faraday cage quot and that might be causing our reception problems </s>
<s> any recommendations </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> at 59 to 100 meters you are at the outer reaches of off the shelf wifi 802 11a b g and need to find better antennas or get a wifi guru to see if they have any ideas </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> i would expect this to not work very well </s>
<s> i d redesign the wireless access points to be closer to the users </s>
<s> cheap in today s market </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob thanks for your always expert advice </s>
<s> i will see if they can get a better antenna </s>
<s> the system is hooked up well by a previous engineer but the antenna really is a good distance from both offices </s>
<s> perhaps a better antenna woudl correct the problem </s>
<s> if not they will have to go to strict cable </s>
<s> thanks from norway </s>
<s> i prefer a more solid solution </s>
<s> that is move the wifi access point closer to the users </s>
<s> then get a second access point and move that toward the other group </s>
<s> i can set one wap on channel 1 and the other on channel 11 to not create interference </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob i may try your suggestion to set the second access point closer to the other office and see if that does the trick you ve been a great help </s>
<s> thanks for the input </s>
