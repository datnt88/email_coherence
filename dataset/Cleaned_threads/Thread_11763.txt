<s> hello i realize my question is going to be a bit vague but i have a computer windows xp sp3 that has a main hd c and a storage drive g </s>
<s> there s nothing on the storage drive other than misc </s>
<s> stuff like pictures taken pdf files work stuff etc </s>
<s> no installed software </s>
<s> if i were to remove this can i just as easily reinsert it and have it work as before or do i need to do something special to ensure the g drive is read again </s>
<s> but some do this and lose access to the drive contents </s>
<s> i ll skip all the scenarios why this happens but sure if you have a backup copy of what you can t lose you re ready </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> possibly a big but we don t know what your computer is </s>
<s> for example mine is a quot tools free quot desktop tower from alienware </s>
<s> tools free means all i have to do is shutdown disconnect the power remove the side panel discharge myself of static then unclip a couple of connections and pull the drive tray out </s>
<s> what makes it easier is that the drives are all sata conventional and no ssds to confuse the issue </s>
<s> what computer is yours </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> hello and thanks for the help </s>
<s> it s your run of the mill e machine desktop </s>
<s> nothing too fancy and removing would only require what you described mark </s>
<s> i believe the hds are sata </s>
<s> those go missing all the time </s>
<s> be sure you have what you can t lose on backups </s>
