<s> recently i purchased an enclosure for a 3 5 quot 120gb seagate hard drive which was slave in my desktop </s>
<s> after installing the hdd in the enclosure plugging it into my laptop and turning it on i could hear the disk spinning but the light on the enclosure didn t come on and the pc showed no signs of recognition </s>
<s> i tried all usb ports turning the hdd on and off restarting the computer </s>
<s> the hdd only contains folders of pictures and mp3 files and both machines use xp home </s>
<s> am i missing something or is something faulty </s>
<s> thanks for your help in advance </s>
<s> you said it was a slave in your desktop </s>
<s> if the jumpers are still set as such this could be your problem </s>
<s> set the drive to cs cable select and try again </s>
<s> now did the pc recognize the enclosure s controller </s>
<s> it must see this first </s>
<s> afterwards the drive should be recognized </s>
<s> sometimes however it cannot read the drive properly and requires partitioning formatting using the disk management tool in xp </s>
<s> i did the same with the same problem </s>
<s> it resolved when i tried a different usb cable the one that came with the unit had serial ability and 2 usb connects </s>
<s> using a direct run resolved the problem </s>
<s> i am still having recognition problems but am now at least detected </s>
<s> hope it helps </s>
