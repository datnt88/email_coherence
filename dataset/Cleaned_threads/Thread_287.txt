<s> i m trying not to get my hopes up but i bet that my mbp will come back with something wrong </s>
<s> if apple moves to replaced it like they had suggested to me i hope i would probably get a santa rosa machine </s>
<s> i doubt that they could get me the exact same one i had since the 2 16ghz models are no longer produced </s>
<s> their store site does not list any refurbished ones either thought that doesn t mean anything i wouldn t want a refurb though </s>
<s> the mac is still relatively new i m wondering if they would swap it with the low end 2 2ghz model which really isn t too different or if they would let me go for the 2 4ghz model </s>
<s> the low end one has half of the graphics memory a somewhat slower clock speed and wouldn t give me any performance boosts that i could actually see </s>
<s> coming from a 2 16ghz model would a 2 4ghz or a 2 6 </s>
<s> show any increased performance </s>
<s> i mean i d have a new nvidia card with double the memory that was on my ati card and i d have a boost of at least 240mhz </s>
<s> plus the battery life is supposed to be very good with those led displays </s>
<s> i hope they let me get a good one that works so i don t have to deal with any more problems i ve already lost a great deal of time because of all this </s>
<s> not to mention i broke a router in the process and had to get another one i ll be happy with at least 2 4ghz and a 250gb hd </s>
<s> 2gb of ram is fine for me </s>
<s> even though the 2 2ghz model replaced mine i really could use a little extra power </s>
<s> the 2 4ghz model seems to represent the santa rosa line anyway does it not </s>
<s> they ll be doing your work and as we all know they tend to grease the squeaky wheels </s>
<s> aren t always customer friendly </s>
<s> i asked one genius a similar question one time </s>
<s> he gave me what seemed to be a dirty look and said that would never happen </s>
<s> at least this time they acknowledged that it would be replaced if it isn t fixed this time </s>
<s> they re shipping it to the depot so they won t see the repairs until it comes back </s>
<s> i hope it comes back before next friday thing is i m trying not to push my luck here </s>
<s> i was assured that it would be completely fixed when it comes back and i intend to hold them to that promise though a new mac would be kind of nice </s>
<s> they have to look at the airport card the ethernet hardware and i hope they look at the board again plus the casing is still messed up and the antennae that runs through the top of the laptop may have had issues too </s>
<s> a little more than greasing i m afraid </s>
<s> a non qualified person opened it up </s>
<s> i ve seen botch jobs but not from the depot </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this one is interesting though i m pretty sure that his situation was far worse than mine </s>
<s> here s the story and the other half that guy s mac saw its fair share of botched jobs </s>
<s> my mac has come back twice now without being fully repaired but it hasn t gotten too bad yet </s>
<s> i mean the first two times i explained to them all of my issues and i told them what i wanted fixed </s>
<s> so far they ve done a bang up job i really hope that they just swap it out when it returns supposing it doesn t work right because that guy s escapade doesn t sound too good </s>
<s> thankfully the two geniuses that helped me out sounded like they got most of it down but i read the sheet with the scheduled repairs on it and i don t think they got them all down like they said </s>
<s> i typed up every single thing i could find and had problems with just for them but i suppose three pages of problems and complaints is too much for them </s>
<s> they said they got them all but i would disagree if that paper is correct </s>
<s> that s what happened the first time the guy didn t write one of the things down </s>
<s> i noticed that before i left and asked him about it </s>
<s> said they had it and would check it out </s>
<s> but they didn t </s>
<s> here it is happening again well i look forward to my santa rosa machine if i end up getting one </s>
<s> my initial question remains do the new santa rosa machines have any substantial advantages over their predecessors </s>
<s> i guess i ll find out but i d like to know ahead of time </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> three pages of whatever quot is quot too much for them i miss my mac now with all of its nifty editing features </s>
<s> at least firefox has spell check </s>
