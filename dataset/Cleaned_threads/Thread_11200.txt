<s> okay i think its a stupid question but i need to settle this with my brother because hes paranoid about getting a virus if i connect the cable modem directly to an infected computer for 10 minutes </s>
<s> then disconnect from that infected computer </s>
<s> then connect the cable modem to the router we have and have our 2 clean computer connect to the router </s>
<s> can the cable modem store a virus from the first computer and then transfer the virus to the 2 clean ones </s>
<s> keep in mind the infected computer was never connected to the router and still isnt </s>
<s> it was only connected directly to the cable modem directly for a short period of time </s>
<s> any responses would be much appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the cable modem has no storage or processor </s>
<s> there s no way any virus can infect a modem </s>
<s> viruses only reside on computers </s>
<s> if you dive deep into most cable modems the firmware and such is controlled by your cable co so for it to catch a virus means that it would currently have to originate from your network provider </s>
<s> as of now there is no other known way to quot infect quot a cable modem </s>
