<s> hi all i ve been wondering how is the reliability of acer desktop computers these days </s>
<s> are people that have them happy with their purchase </s>
<s> any issues </s>
<s> i m looking to get a new computer nothing major and the price that i m seeing here and there seems ok i m looking around the web and it s hard to have a clear picture as to how their desktops are </s>
<s> thx for the info </s>
<s> these seem no better or worse than all the lines from hp dell gateway and the ford or chevy pc makers </s>
<s> what i do find is that acer seems to have fair out of the box experiences and you can make a set of restore dvds and then copy those </s>
<s> then use the machine </s>
<s> if you want reliable get a toaster </s>
<s> pcs are not very reliable bob </s>
<s> so instead of saying anything that would prejudice any one particular brand over another i ll recommend you to consumerreports com where you can do side by side unbiased independent comparisons of different products of the same type such as laptops desktops and whatnots </s>
<s> reports did a report a couple months ago on computer reliability and the short version is that you are buying performance you get what you pay for not reliability </s>
<s> for the money for basic desk top computer needs acers are as good if not better then an emachine or a compac again in the price point performance </s>
<s> if you want something that s more up gradable has more under the hood check out gateway hp and dell </s>
<s> personally speaking i find gateway a very good bang for buck at your local big box store </s>
<s> bought gateway last year </s>
<s> the word seems to be just getting out i have at present 5 gateway and 1 acer machines </s>
<s> i m hoping that the tech support will improve at gateway but i won t hold my breath </s>
<s> i had a couple of acer s back in the 90 s and they were great </s>
<s> i went to gateway because they had a tech facility and showroom here </s>
<s> that is gone about 2 years now </s>
<s> tech support with either now the same i suppose has always been spotty or iffy </s>
<s> acer acquired gateway which brought emachine so the whole idea of a decent system seems remote </s>
<s> but the fact remains the acer brand itself has been pretty good </s>
<s> it never was a big seller and that alone accounts for the quality of the brand as sloppiness didn t get passed on in mass productions numbers </s>
<s> support is there but once the warranty date is reached it becomes harder and you pay if dealing with acer </s>
<s> the same for any other brand but acer really draws the line </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i bought an acers desktop on 12 15 09 for 900 00 only use it for 1 month and all of a sudden it won t turn on </s>
<s> i ve call tech support they aks me to purchase a 20 driver from them to reboot </s>
<s> i did buy the cd reboot and still don t work </s>
<s> i call again they said i have to ship it in to be fix </s>
<s> it cost me another 20 to ship it </s>
<s> i receive my computer back yesterday still not work the same problem is still there </s>
<s> i don t think technical support even fix it </s>
<s> i ve call again and they said to ship it back to them again </s>
<s> acers is a bad choice to make bad computer bad company </s>
<s> i had to send my acer desktop in for repair three times </s>
<s> each time they claimed they fixed the problem but they didn t </s>
<s> their computer would show changed motherboard and memory but the print out sent to me would show software reinstalled </s>
<s> the boot problem never went away until the third time </s>
<s> thankfully the acer office was not too far from my house otherwise would have to pay shipping </s>
<s> tech support want to an indian call centre and was very scripted </s>
<s> so frusturating </s>
<s> i didn t learn my lesson </s>
<s> today i purchased another acer thinking that my first experience was just my bad luck well right out of the box and the back end is dented in </s>
<s> i dont know about you but i have acer laptop 6 years old and its working fine never anything worse than windows error message acer is cheap and no gaming machine at it </s>
<s> the acer s are very reliable i have a desktop and laptop </s>
<s> my desktop is around 2 yrs old now and i had only one problem with it which technical support easily solved </s>
<s> that is the big selling point their after sales service is excellent which is why i will be buying an acer when i upgrade </s>
<s> my laptop was bought 2nd hand out of warranty and when i had a problem with the cursor i contacted technical support and they solved the problem for free </s>
<s> an excellent range of computers too </s>
<s> ummm if you like gateway then you like acer </s>
<s> acer owns gateway </s>
