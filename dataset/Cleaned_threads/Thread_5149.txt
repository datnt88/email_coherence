<s> i have accidentally lifted the lever seating my cpu while working on my pc </s>
<s> i put the lever back down </s>
<s> will i need to properly seat my cpu again with thermal paste or will it be ok everything seems to be working fine but i can t help thinking it is a little slower or am i just being paranoid </s>
<s> idle core temp is 52 deg c 125f on an amd 64 3000 with standard heatsink and fan on an msi k8n neo motherboard </s>
<s> don t know what the temp was before </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> think of it as a sandwich with the cpu on the bottom </s>
<s> fan heatsink cpu the thermal paste is between the cpu and the heatsink think mayo </s>
<s> when the lever is down the socket clamps snugly on the processor pins </s>
<s> when you lift the lever it unclamps the pins and does not necessarily shift the heatsink with respect to the cpu </s>
<s> so unless there was movement you don t need to replace the mayo er uh thermal paste </s>
<s> the ultimate test is as you implied if the cpu temp is too high then replace it </s>
<s> also check your fan speed </s>
<s> cpu temp is also a relative thing </s>
<s> if your system temp is 30 c 52 c resting might be a little high but if your system temp is gt 40 c 52 c is not unreasonable </s>
<s> thanks man </s>
<s> you ve put my mind at rest </s>
<s> i like that comparison </s>
<s> if you do have to repalce the paste go easy on the mayo </s>
<s> john </s>
