<s> i have two hard drives in my hp one with xp sp2 and the other drive has linux mandrake </s>
<s> how do i remove linux from the second drive i m pretty sure it s the slave and free up that drive so i can use it for xp </s>
<s> i m not very computer savvy so if you can help please don t get too technical on me </s>
<s> thanks very much </s>
<s> if you are truly a dual boot system when you boot your system it will give you a choice of mandrake or other </s>
<s> if this is the case and you do not want to reinstall xp and its gazillion updates </s>
<s> format the drive that contains mandrake you will still get the option screen at start up but will now have your former linux drive available for xp </s>
<s> if you presently do not get the option screen at start up </s>
<s> just reformat the drive with mandrake installed </s>
<s> if you are unfamiliar with formating a hard drive click on help and check out formatting it contains a very easy explanation of formatting and all the options </s>
<s> if you really want to get rid of linux the first thing to do is get hold of a win98 startup disk </s>
<s> insert into floppy drive and boot computer </s>
<s> at the command prompt c type in c fdisk mbr </s>
<s> this will get rid of the boot loader for linux and restore you windows loader then type in exit at command prompt </s>
<s> remove floppy and reboot computer </s>
<s> when windows has fully loaded left click on start all programs administrative tools computer management then disk management in the window that opens showing you disks </s>
<s> right click on the drive that linux was installed on and click on format </s>
<s> you have now got rid of linux </s>
<s> reboot your computer and the drive that was linux should now be a blank drive ready for you to use </s>
<s> this may seem very simplified but i have not done this for a while and i am writing this from memory </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> roxxxy you have a very workable system now </s>
<s> i d recommend you simply learn to use the linux system it s not that different from windows and while windows development is slowing down dramatically linux is exploding </s>
<s> also i personally don t like the direction windows is headed with us users having less and less control over what our computers will do </s>
<s> i didn t want quot big brother quot deciding what s best for me and i certainly don t want bill gates to do it </s>
<s> by its very nature linux has no ceo and very little government control </s>
<s> also very little malware virus etc is being written for linux and i see a day coming soon when some virus cripples nearly all windows computers </s>
<s> that nearly did happen a few years back with the blaster worm </s>
