<s> not sure i am in the rigth forum </s>
<s> i am looking for an inexpensive monitor for work </s>
<s> i definitely want a 5 4 aspect ratio not a wide screen </s>
<s> i am looking at three hanns g comparable 19 inch models </s>
<s> the differences seem so minor that i can t make out what is significant </s>
<s> models are jc199apd hh191dpb and hx191dpb </s>
<s> found your post and nothing else </s>
<s> is there a link to this available </s>
<s> sorry that i did not provide more info </s>
<s> i am new at this </s>
<s> the page is in the cnet review site </s>
<s> i tried to add the link here but o luck </s>
<s> i just copied it </s>
<s> i ll tell why in a moment </s>
<s> the hannsg hh 191dpb contrast ratio pulls it ahead of the others </s>
<s> dhcp helps too </s>
<s> for me this model is a no sale since these are not the current technology of wide screen </s>
<s> because of my work i must get the new displays that you see today or my software efforts would be hampered by using the older displays </s>
<s> i m sure you have a reason for this choice </s>

<s> i am probably a little naive about this but my reason for preferring a 5 4 aspect ratio to a wide screen is being able to see two documents at once one above the other and see more of one document at a time </s>
<s> graphics capabilities is not my primary concern </s>
<s> i realize everything has moved to wide screen format </s>
<s> perharps there are some disadvantages that i don t understand </s>
<s> i welcome your thoughts on this </s>
<s> i picked up the swivel model as you see at if i didn t swivel that then maybe 2 docs side by side </s>
<s> all personal choice there </s>
