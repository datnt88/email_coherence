<s> hello i have a small web desing agency </s>
<s> we work mostly with files 1 to 10mb and sometimes with larger files up to 300 400mb </s>
<s> we are moving files over the network from workstations to server and backwards we have a file check out system on the server </s>
<s> at this time we are 4 desingers but i need a solution that works up to 8 10 peole </s>
<s> we are moving from our office to a new location and i m thinking to install only a wlan network but i don t know if the speed would be good for me </s>
<s> at this time we are working ok on a 100mbps wired network </s>
<s> i heard that 802 11n have speeds up to 300mbps that s 3 times faster but i don t know if that s only in theory or if in practice it will work at that speed </s>
<s> so i have the next questions 1 the 300mbps of 802 11n are true on practice or only on theory on quot ideal quot situations </s>
<s> 2 if we connect 3 users at the same time what will happen with the speed </s>
<s> we have to split the total speed between all the users connected </s>
<s> 3 is there any problem right now with security and availability for wlans </s>
<s> 4 i m considering linksys wrvs4400n router </s>
<s> it s good or there are better routers for this </s>
<s> 5 what would be a nice configuration for me </s>
<s> router access point switch i don t know what i need thanks a lot </s>
<s> nacho </s>
<s> wired is the fastest route </s>
<s> if you get a n router and don t replace the wireless cards in the computers then they can only use the g parft of the router which in case connect at 54 0 mbps lan would be the fastest </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> a couple of notes on the 4400n first i have found that the speed is certainly adequate but i tend to get quite a few dropped connections </s>
<s> i m not 100 positive whether it is the router or the wpc4400n cards </s>
<s> you will have to get n cards or as a previous respondent indicated you will only connect at g speeds </s>
<s> one security note since you are using this in a business environment i presume you will be using wpa enterprise </s>
<s> if so you will want to use wzc and not linksys network monitor to configure the cards </s>
<s> the reason for this is that lnm does not give you the option of validating the server certificate and this would leave you vulnerable to a type of man in the middle attack referred to as a validation failure attack </s>
<s> while this attack rather sophisticated and is quite hard to mount it is a concern nonetheless </s>
<s> i hpe this helps </s>
