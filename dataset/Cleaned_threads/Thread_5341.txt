<s> i bought myself a 1 gb stick of ram for an old tower i had been using but it has since died i m hoping the ram stick didn t have anything to do with it </s>
<s> i believe the ram is ddr 1 so i m wondering if i go and buy myself a new 3 gb equipped computer that uses ddr3 and i put the old stick in one of it s spare slots will that helpmate computer in any way </s>
<s> or would it just hinder it </s>
<s> i think the technical term for what i m asking is backwards compatibility </s>
<s> will that help the computer </s>
<s> you cannot put a ddr1 ram in a ddr3 socket </s>
<s> it won t fit </s>
