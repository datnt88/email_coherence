<s> hi i just bought an external dvd burner plextor px 716uf i think it s an external version of the px 716a </s>
<s> but i didn t read properly before i bought it and it seems this drive doesn t burn on r dl dvds only the r dl disks </s>
<s> i m thinking of returning it because it is my understanding that r even a r dl disk is more friendly with commercial dvd players like if i burn something on a dl disk i want to make sure it will work at home not just on my computer </s>
<s> is this correct </s>
<s> if so can anyone suggest a burner i can buy when if i return the plextor px 716uf </s>
<s> maybe a better burner with more capabilities </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> ohh i have a macintish computer so whatever burner i get has to be mac compatible </s>
<s> writes quot date posted june 15 2005 improved the write performance on dvd r dual layer media quot would i win a bet your firmware is out of date </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> let me tell you plextor has been no help i did actually update the firmware </s>
<s> but here s the funny part in some places on plextor s website is says it does support dvd r dl and in other places it says it does not support it </s>
<s> i updated my firmware because thed update says it will burn dvd r dl but then i emailed plextor about it and the response i got was that the drive does not do r dl but you re right the updated firmware says it does only probelm is plextor still says they don t </s>
<s> they need to make up their mind about this </s>
<s> i want to test it out myself but i can t seem to find dvd r dl disks anywhere </s>
<s> i think i ll have to order them online or something </s>
<s> i m been pummeled for adding a feature in some devices and causing web and printed content to go out of sync </s>
<s> just asking why must you have dl dvd r </s>
<s> it seems odd since you can t find the media </s>
<s> i did see dl dvd r out there and my friend says it played fine on his players </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> downsizing lol the reason i was looking for r was that it s my understanding that r media is more compatible with stand alone dvd players and such </s>
<s> so i want to try what i can to make sure if i burn any videos they will play in most dvd players </s>
<s> and i always thought r worked but r worked better </s>
<s> is that wrong </s>
<s> the issue here is that it all depends on the list of players you have to play with </s>
<s> at first i found r to play widely </s>
<s> now the list is reversed with more r than r here s why i know </s>
<s> i have to keep a list of what type to send to who for demos </s>
<s> cheers bob </s>
<s> just go to newegg com and order the nec </s>
<s> always sells for 40 47 including shipping </s>
<s> it burns all media except dvd ram and is rated close to 100 in customer reviews </s>
<s> it burns at speeds up to 16x </s>
