<s> what can i get to clean the fingerprints off my computer screen </s>
<s> my daughter always touches it </s>
<s> is it coated </s>
<s> do you have any instructions that came with the monitor that might address this </s>
<s> if so follow those </s>
<s> most crts are glass or coated glass </s>
<s> regular glass cleaners using a soft cloth without rubbing will usually work fine </s>
<s> some camera lens cleaners might also be good to take away small fingerprints </s>
<s> again soft cloth such as for use on glasses or lenses should be ok avoid strong solvents of course and stick with mild surfactants where grease and oil are a problem </s>
<s> maybe some coaching for your daughter might help if she s old enough to understand </s>
<s> this is a crt model </s>
<s> it looks like glass to me </s>
<s> actually it doesn t metter what kind of screen </s>
<s> there are so many resources of cleaning </s>
<s> but i prefer humid serviettes it suits for any screens </s>
<s> go to computer shop you could find it everywhere </s>
<s> 1 a gentle application of glass cleaner to the crt 2 a gentle application of parental correction to your daughter </s>
<s> use just about any quot glass cleaner quot to wipe a glassed monitor </s>
<s> best to apply to cloth or rag instead of directly on monitor surface then wipe </s>
<s> however if you monitor is really a lcd type don t do this buy the required special wipes or cleaner for that purpose </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
