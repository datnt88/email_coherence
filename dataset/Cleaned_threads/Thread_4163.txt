<s> it has a 300 watts smps psu </s>
<s> i m planning to upgrade to a 400 watts smps </s>
<s> but there s a problem </s>
<s> my lenovo smps has a 2 pin power slot for the lenovo lcd tft monitor </s>
<s> does all smps have that slot </s>
<s> or else then what should i do now </s>
<s> if it isn t connected to anything on the motherboard i don t see why there should be a problem </s>

<s> my lenovo lcd tft monitor is connected to that slot because the lenovo monitor gets the power from that slot present on the psu now what should i do </s>
<s> i thought this was a desktop </s>
<s> it is but a small form factor desktop </s>
<s> i was kind of confused there lol </s>
<s> i would say that the 400w should include it </s>
<s> where are you buying it from </s>
<s> might they list the connectors like most sites </s>
