<s> i was looking for the review for the tablet </s>

<s> gt let me warn you off today s droid pads </s>

<s> cnet is a little slow on reviewing tabs unless its an i something or samsung </s>
<s> dont know what donald bell has been up too lately this is suposed to be his thing </s>
<s> i have been watching this product </s>
<s> if your looking and trust posted reviews </s>
<s> check out the bestbuy com site </s>
<s> seems people like this </s>
<s> i also like it but i just wish it had more internal memory </s>
<s> plus is the gps wifi takes a sim and con is no flash support </s>
<s> something else if your just looking for an entertainment tab creative ziio 7 waiting for an review on this one too </s>
<s> im no pro but the s7 does not have flash support so your seeing mobile web with it and no official android market </s>
<s> it was in my consideration for purchase </s>
<s> i passed on it though and went with the elocity a7 and will also purchase the enspert idenity tab e201u i think they are both better buys with full froyo out the box and the a7 can be easily modded to get android market </s>
<s> you can also look for the s7 on youtube </s>
<s> but your most likey to get some review from someone you can hardly understand </s>
