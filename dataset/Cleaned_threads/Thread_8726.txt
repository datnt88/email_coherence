<s> a little while ago i was advised that i could use ntfs 3g coupled with macfuse in order to backup a macbook to an ntfs formatted external hard drive </s>
<s> looks like this may be necessary b c my wife s macbook is having serious issues has become ridiculously slow don t know why </s>
<s> if i do this and then get the machine repaired in a way that wipes her internal hard drive clean should we be able to restore her machine from the ntfs formatted external drive </s>
<s> i assume that i ll have to re install ntfs 3g and macfuse before doing so but after that should i be able to restore the macbook </s>
<s> you can restore the machine with the apple os dvd then install fuse then copy your files back </s>
<s> sorry that i misunderstood your needs </s>
<s> these two are different goals </s>
<s> 1 restore the macbook </s>
<s> 2 restore my files </s>
<s> thanks and no you didn t misunderstand </s>
<s> it s only in the last day or so that we thought her hard drive might be in trouble originally i was just curious about backing up her data as a quot just in case quot sort of thing </s>
<s> much appreciated </s>
