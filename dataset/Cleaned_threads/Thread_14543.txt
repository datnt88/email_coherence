<s> i have recently encountred a very weird problem </s>
<s> i turned off my computer and came back the next day to find out it didn t work </s>
<s> the weird thing is the fans will work and power supply and motherboard fan all turn on when i push the switch but normally when i push the switch there s a green light at the front that will light up </s>
<s> it no longer lights up and my monitor remains completely idle </s>
<s> can anyone advise me as to what could be the problem </s>
<s> i ve already checdk to make sure the video card is pushed in solidly and i m really confused </s>
<s> thanks for your time and my specs are below </s>
<s> asus p4s8x x motherboard geforce 4 fx 5600 1 gb of ram 80gb harddrive </s>
<s> check out this dicussion </s>
<s> this is a common problem </s>
<s> all too often the power supply is the culprit however a bad componet can give the same result </s>
<s> you really need to inspect the mtrbd </s>
<s> up close to see any fault or possible blown capacitors </s>
<s> if not found what seems to work is simply reseat any cards and try again </s>
<s> if your system had alot of quot heat stress quot what may look good is really poor componet s that have become a weak link </s>
<s> try shortening the quot power on quot lead that come from the frt </s>
<s> panel for a monent </s>
<s> it should respond with the system trying to start just like pushing the on button </s>
<s> if it still fails some success is found in removing the mtrbd try a simple test with it out of case on some non conductive material like cardboard and see if results are different then re install into case is postive no power </s>
<s> all the suggestions are ed </s>
<s> guesses as this problem may go away then return but usually its power related even if fans run the logic to fully turn on system is low or faulty </s>
<s> remove cpu and check the socket if brown looking or cyctralized you have heat problem </s>
<s> if black or super dusty you conductive materials allowing static to play havoc </s>
<s> oh yeah real bugs can die their last across some contacts </s>
<s> but the best bet is to replace the power supply with one of 400w or better </s>
<s> good lcuk willy </s>
