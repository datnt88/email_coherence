<s> so far until today i ve had good luck being a cheapskate and buying expired genuine epson ink cartridges up to a year past the quot use before quot date </s>
<s> today though i tried two black ink cartridges that have a quot use before quot 7 2004 date and no black ink comes out of them </s>
<s> the black ink light though does not illuminate on my epson stylus color 600 printer </s>
<s> i used the cleaning feature 2 times and still no black ink coming out </s>
<s> i wonder why the black ink light doesn t come on </s>
<s> it always does when there is no ink left </s>
<s> will running the cleaning cycle 10 times help or did the ink dry up in the hermetically sealed cartridge </s>
<s> what has been your luck with expired ink cartridges </s>
<s> i guess the ink and sponge dried out </s>
<s> dont even try it </s>
<s> the quot optium quot usage of any inks is to be within its quot use by quot period </s>
<s> while the degrading levels can differ it s just a warning to use by and prolonged usage of such inks can only lead to a final gasp </s>
<s> however since using epson or anyone else s ink brand can cause similar results sooner or later as epson prtheads will clog </s>
<s> the sad fact is clearing clogged epson prthead isn t as easy or quickly resolved by replacing the prthead by a user so quot cleaing cycles quot are the best approach and repeated cleaning is a must </s>
<s> that uses alot of ink and the expense can be high </s>
<s> i suggest you find a vendor that sells a quot cleaning cartridge quot which contains some cleaner or solvents that can handle stubborn clogs as the cheapest solution otherwise repair is too costly just replace the printer </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
