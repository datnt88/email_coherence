<s> i have a cannon pixma copier printer scanner connected to a targa xp computer </s>
<s> the printer and copier are working very well but the scanner fails to work </s>
<s> i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it from its disc but to no avail </s>
<s> any solutions or suggestions other that dumping it please </s>
<s> i should have said that it is a cannon pixma mp130 </s>
<s> ian </s>
<s> sadly the last test is to try it on another pc </s>
<s> often a part of these all in ones will fail and if the quot copy quot button works we still need to test if it works on other pc as a test of the all in one </s>
<s> there are other reasons today such as malware damage firewalls and more but your post didn t tell if you tried the uninstall and reinstall without the pc being quot protected quot bob </s>
<s> thanks for the info bob </s>
<s> unfortunately the only other pc i have is vista and it does not support the pixma mp130 </s>
<s> i ll triy installing it with the firewall and viruse protection switched of </s>
<s> i ll let you know how i get on </s>
