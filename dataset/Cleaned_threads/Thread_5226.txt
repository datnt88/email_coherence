<s> given the lack of requested information i m assuming os x here highlight select your epson r200 and then click on the show info button in the tool bar </s>
<s> in the resulting window you should see the driver information </s>
<s> if there is a number like 5 x or the word beta then you are not actually using the epson driver </s>
<s> let us know p </s>
<s> you might want to mention your os version and the type of mac you have p </s>
