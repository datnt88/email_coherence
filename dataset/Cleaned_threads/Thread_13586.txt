<s> i have just purchased an external floppy drive for my desktop vista when i try to view a floppy disk that whas created on my laptop xp it tells me that the floppy needs formatting of course this will delete all information on the floppy when i did try to format on the desktop after a few seconds it tells me that windows was unable to format i need access to the information on the floppy does anybody know what the problem is and how to fix it regards </s>
<s> if the floppy reads on other machines this new drive is dead </s>
<s> no the drive works fine with a new floppy i formatted a disk and saved work to it it will not read the floppy disks that were formatted on my lapyop </s>
<s> floppies are notoriously unreliable </s>
<s> certainly not suited for long term storage </s>
<s> but a good albeit somewhat oldfashioned slow and low capacity way to transfer files between machines that don t have internet or usb </s>
<s> all you can try read the diskette on your laptop and see if that recognizes it </s>
<s> that s not impossible although unlikely </s>
<s> then transfer the data using mail or usb stick </s>
<s> this is the umpteenth if not more proof that having data on one place only is an invitation to the gods of it to destroy it and lose it </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> there are some worms that alter the boot area of floppies and you get this sort of complaint </s>
<s> but if new diskettes work fine and diskettes from other machines are fine but not from this laptop then you found the problem </s>
