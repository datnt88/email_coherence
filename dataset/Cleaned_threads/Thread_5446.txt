<s> i just got a program called speedfan v4 34 the readings i got are as follow fan 1 4821 rpm fan 2 0 rpm fan 3 0 rpm temp 1 25c temp 2 55c temp 3 52c hd0 35c so um is that normal for a pc or is this software just useless </s>
<s> if yes then is there any foolproof way to moniter pc temperature </s>
<s> please explain in details </s>
<s> sorry if posted in wrong section </s>
<s> the author of speedfan also has a support forum if i recall </s>
<s> there are some that will demand it works but keep in mind the price we paid here </s>
<s> again take it up with the author and be sure to supply whatever details they ask for </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t dwell too much on monitoring pgms speedfan included </s>
<s> i use them during a fix to check results but not on a constant basis monitoring </s>
<s> it can be off and i tend to use them as a suggested rate of observation </s>
<s> others may say they get good results but real measurements can vary from those provided by any such apps so take with a grain of salt </s>
<s> on top of all that proper install of ans etc </s>
<s> will show at least they re working </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> you were not specific in your concerns </s>
<s> the 55c could be a pin that could have a temp sensor but is not used </s>
<s> as to foolproof the old saying is once you make it foolproof only _ools would use it </s>
<s> good luck bob </s>
<s> some secondary fans don t support speed monitoring </s>
<s> likewise some motherboards bioses don t implement temperature monitoring in a standard fashion </s>
<s> you can configure speedfan to ignore skip the sensors that aren t producing a reading </s>
<s> if you want a foolproof method you ll have to download monitoring software from your motherboard manufacturer and use only pwm fans </s>
<s> well a person on another board told me that no other softwares will give me a more accurate status reading of my pc then my system bios </s>
<s> accordingly i went into bios setup pressing del twice and checked out an option called pc health status </s>
<s> it showed cpu temperature 67c cpu fan speed 4821 4963 rpm system fan speed 0 rpm now here i have some questions </s>
<s> first is 67c an ok temp for my pc </s>
<s> second what is the difference between cpu fan and system fan </s>
<s> i can open my cpu cabinet </s>
<s> can someone tell me how to identify and check if both cpu and system fan are there and working </s>
<s> i can see three fans one on the board motherboard second attached to the cabinet which can be seen from the back holes of the cabinet and third i believe in the power supply box inside at the topmost side of the cabinet </s>
<s> checking with a flashlight they all seems to be rotating </s>
<s> system info gigabyte 8i845gvmrz motherboard intel pentium 4 chipset i845g 512 mb ram running windows 2000 pro and award modular bios v6 00pg </s>
<s> that s on the intel com site but 67c is fine </s>
<s> maybe if you shared if there is an issue with the pc we could break free of this gazing at temps </s>
<s> well actually there are many problems and i had a feeling it had something to do with fans and pc temperature </s>
<s> first and worst problem is that sometimes when i am running my pc suddenly in the middle it hangs for sometime and then restarts </s>
<s> on the first screen after restart primary master disk is not detected </s>
<s> like this pri </s>
<s> master disk none pri </s>
<s> slave disk none sec </s>
<s> master disk none sec </s>
<s> slave disk none and on the second screen after restart an error comes up after which i can do nothing but turn off the main power switch of the pc </s>
<s> error is boot from cd dvd disk boot failure insert system disk and press enter weather i try to install norton ghost 2003 image which i had earlier created or even to reinstall the whole windows 2000 pro from its install cd error comes up saying that hard drives are not detected </s>
<s> i have observed this problem mostly occurs when i am installing softwares running windows update or browsing my picture folders thumbnail view which contains a lots of pictures </s>
<s> only now know what the real issues are </s>
<s> you may want to rethink such posts since they rarely get back on track of the real problem </s>
<s> gt now that i know this i can share that many i845 boards had bad caps see google about bad caps and many are old </s>
<s> the old tired power supply can have the same issue so we know to inspect for the bad caps plus pop in a monster power supply for a test run </s>
<s> we also leave the cover off until we think we ve fixed it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no profit mate i wanted to know some things about my pc fans as well as the rest of its problems </s>
<s> especially why bios is stating system fan is at 0 rpm readings </s>
<s> but moving on to my main problem i will see what google says about i845 boards and bad caps </s>
<s> about power supply box i had it changed a year back and repaired couple of months back </s>
<s> so its not that old </s>
<s> i didn t understand what you mean by quot leave the cover off until we think we ve fixed it quot </s>
<s> i mean you should quot leave the cover off until we think we ve fixed it quot your choice here </s>
