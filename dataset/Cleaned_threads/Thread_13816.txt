<s> i first posted this in the windows xp forums but it seems this is a software hardware issue </s>
<s> i m having difficulty with my system booting </s>
<s> i m using windows xp pro </s>
<s> the problem started while booting my system one morning and it froze midway through the process </s>
<s> it was at the screen with the windows xp logo and the boxes going across the progress bar it would get roughly half done and then freeze </s>
<s> i was able to log into the computer using the quot last known good configuration quot setting </s>
<s> windows informed me that the system had recovered from a serious error </s>
<s> it said it was caused by a device driver </s>
<s> the only thing i ve changed recently on the system was the video card </s>
<s> i installed a radeon 9800 pro about 2 weeks ago and up to this point it has worked fine </s>
<s> but since i ve gotten the system back up i ve tried reinstalling the drivers twice but to no avail </s>
<s> each time the system freezes during the boot process </s>
<s> i ve searched ati s site for help but i haven t found anything that directly relates to my problem </s>
<s> screens now scroll strange it s like it goes a screen at a time rather than a smooth scroll </s>
<s> i ve tried scandisk norton anti virus i ve checked spyware </s>
<s> i then switched back to my old radeon 8500le card and the system boots fine </s>
<s> i installed the drivers and there was no problem </s>
<s> could an insufficient power supply cause a freeze in the boot up </s>
<s> or is it likely a defective card </s>
<s> read </s>
<s> you re new 9800 is far more demanding than your old 8500 model </s>
<s> i would crtainly consider a new power supply in the 400w range </s>
<s> don t settle for a cheap one either but at least get a 350w unit but strongly suggest that 400w </s>
<s> pricing isn t that bad but better ones do cost so be prepapred </s>
<s> on top of that since you mentioned it worked again after returning the old video card don t try the new until the new p s is installed </s>
<s> you can further test by unhooking the cd drive s and verify under bios that they re gone for a temp </s>
<s> fix and quick check </s>
<s> if it boots up w o a glitch then p s unit </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> so a lack of power could actually cause the boot sequence to stop midway through </s>
<s> i had no idea </s>
<s> how does this power supply look </s>
<s> is it too cheap </s>
<s> try removing some devices to see if the problem clears up as the power draw decreases </s>
<s> disconnect the cd and floppy and see if it goes through a clean boot </s>
<s> if yes add the devices back in one at a time until it fails </s>
<s> if it always fails with the new video in you probably need to look elsewhere </s>
<s> check file dates past last good configuration to see what else besides the drivers changed </s>
<s> the power supply </s>
<s> while i can t say your problems will go away by simply replacing the psu if you plan on upgrading your pc a properly rated psu is a must </s>
<s> others will say their system is running fine on insufficient power it is only a matter of time </s>
<s> your boot problems i believe are due to the card itself or flaky drivers </s>
<s> drivers not uninstalled before changing cards or out of date drivers can cause your ills </s>
<s> ati has been known for iffy drivers </s>
<s> install drivers from the cd </s>
<s> i d go to the site and get the most current </s>
<s> wish you luck tom </s>
<s> i tried the drivers from the ati site three times and each time it caused the boot sequence to freeze up </s>
<s> then i tried the dirvers off the cd and had the same result </s>
<s> the thing that really has me puzzled is the fact that the system worked fine for two weeks with the 9800 </s>
<s> i can t be sure if this will help you but i have a radeon 9600 card that that has not worked properly with any issue of new drivers since september </s>
<s> i posted my problem in these forums as well </s>
<s> i waited through several new catalyst sets thinking ati would pick up on this if it were a driver issue </s>
<s> my problem is that my monitor would go into what looked like a standby mode when the xp spash opened </s>
<s> then it would reboot and try again </s>
<s> eventually it would start but i received a message about recovering from a serious error pointing to the radeon device or drivers </s>
<s> so far the solution has been to use older drivers and wait for ati to address the problem </s>
<s> my os is also xp pro and my psu is a 430w antec </s>
<s> the system is not overloaded with devices so i don t think my problem has anything to do with it since i have another computer with 9 ide devices a radeon card and 3 more add in cards with only a 400w supply and it never wimpers </s>
<s> radeon has older drivers available so i d get the oldest first and if it works move up as far as you can before the system hangs </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> return exchange the card </s>
<s> if it s a few weeks old you shouldn t get a hassle about an exchange </s>
<s> good luck tom </s>
