<s> i was looking at the lite on sohw 1633s and the plextor 712a sa </s>
<s> the lite on is 40 cheaper and i wanted to know which one was better </s>
<s> both got good reviews on newegg </s>
<s> oh and i was planning on purchasing a lite on ltr 52327s as a cheap cd r writer as well </s>
<s> it also got good reviews so i figured the dvd writer should be good too </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i just bought a 832s dvd burner for 35 bucks after rebate </s>
<s> sold my old cd burner installed for 30 bucks </s>
<s> for 5 bucks i got an upgrade from cd burner to dvd the dvd burns cds as well </s>
<s> why buy a seperate drive </s>
<s> tom </s>
<s> i bought a lite on 1633s because it was cheaper and i stupidly forgot that one gets what they pay for </s>
<s> i bought it on a thursady it was dead by sunday morning </s>
<s> aside from quality issues the plextor comes with roxio while the lite on comes with nero </s>
<s> nero is not an acceptable substitute for roxio so case closed </s>
<s> plextor </s>
<s> after years with both plextor feels no different and in fact i feel like i overpaid for such </s>
<s> now i just pick out the cheap unit place it in the rack with airspace top bottom and good cooling </s>
<s> never lost an unit that wasn t 4 years old </s>
<s> roxio bolloxes up the system too much for me so i prefer nero and more often than not i use cdburnerxp since it gets the job done without complaining it didn t come with the drive </s>
<s> see bob </s>
<s> look at for test results and more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> its all down to personal choice but in a market driven by quot more bang fer ya bucks quot ive been a lite on devotee for years </s>
<s> i paid 170 for an 8 speed cdwriter 4 years ago and within a month or two lite on were selling 24 speed writers for 60 as friends bought theirs i was sitting smugly waiting for their cheapo plastic burners to fall to pieces </s>
<s> they didnt </s>
<s> mine did </s>
<s> since then ive built and sold dozens of pcs and upgraded and repaired many more </s>
<s> whether it was a cdrom or a cdwriter or now dvd cd burner combos ive never yet had a problem with a lite on </s>
<s> quite often on a clean system with decent processor andm emory they actually peform at max speed or above </s>
<s> like someone else who posted here i also agree with the software bundle </s>
<s> roxio has its fans but many more detractors </s>
<s> nero is simple to use and installs like a dream with little need for end user input </s>
<s> from this users point of view in my own pcs and the ones ive built you cant go wrong with a lite on and they cost a heck of a lot less than most other brands </s>
