<s> i have a dilema that i can t sort out </s>
<s> i have a home receiver hooked up to my pc </s>
<s> one of the analog 1 8 quot mini out s goes to the a set of rca in jacks on the receiver </s>
<s> i was thinking about getting a new sound card like the audigy 2 zs but i don t think it will do what i want it to </s>
<s> i would like to connect my pc via a digital or optical out from the back of the pc to the stereo </s>
<s> this way my receiver is giving me every ounce of stereo music that is being produced </s>
<s> i m sure that home stereo speakers sound quite a bit better than pc speaker sets but i don t think there is a card that will do what i want </s>
<s> i am not interested in running a wire to the front of my pc like audigy 2 zs platinum can anyone recommend a way to get a stereo optical or digital out for the audigy 2 zs or another card that might play as well </s>
<s> thanks po </s>
<s> you say anthing about what pc you have </s>
<s> one of the options is to coxal digitial audio the cables are much cheeper and the sound is the same </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> i believe the sound blaster audigy 2zs can plug into an external input output device that has optical out </s>
<s> i know their external audigy 2 has this feature so i m willing to bet it can be added to the cheaper internal card </s>
<s> i use an audigy 2zs gamers edition myself </s>
<s> with the audigy2 zs its a snap </s>
<s> just connect the digital audio out cable digital coax to a digital audio coax input on your a v receiver </s>
<s> viola </s>
<s> now you ve got audio from your pc playing through the home speakers connected to your home receiver </s>
<s> you will need a receiver that has a digital audio input any current receiver has several of them </s>
<s> if your receiver only has a digital optical input then you will have to get a converter cable for the digital coax to digital optical </s>
<s> these converters are very cheap and can be bought anywhere </s>
<s> i am about to purchase the audigy2 zs sound card myself </s>
<s> this card is amazing and offers everything you could possibly want </s>
<s> you won t need one of the higher end cards unless you need to do highly specific technical work </s>
<s> i thought about using home speakers and a home receiver with my pc but i am going to go ahead and buy the logitech z 5500 5 1 speakers and processor because this speaker setup is loaded with features and has absolutely incredible sound </s>
<s> the clarity and power are truly top notch </s>
<s> as hard as i looked i couldn t see a spec that said this card had a digital audio out </s>
<s> or maybe i m getting confused </s>
<s> there definitely wasn t an optical out and there are no analog outs </s>
<s> i started thinking that maybe i m wasting my time on the home receiver because i ve heard such good things about some of the pc speaker sets like the logitech </s>
<s> i also read that regular speakers don t sound great when you re sitting quot on top quot of them </s>
<s> pc speakers are designed to be listened to at closer ranges </s>
<s> when i read that i turned a song on at my desk and listened to half of it while seated at the desk and the other half about 8 feet away from the desk </s>
<s> the song sounded better from a distance </s>
<s> i have a p4 1 4 512mb 200gb windows xp pro machine </s>
<s> it s more than enough for my needs </s>
<s> i don t game but i love to listen to music </s>
<s> want to set the pc up as a media center but for now i m stuck sitting at my desk and letting the sound hit me in the face </s>
<s> naturally i want the best sound i can get and if you read all the articles i ve read you go crazy worrying about internal electrical interferences bit rates which codec is best and how to get the best sound from your speakers </s>
<s> i could really use some helpful advice from anyone who has been through what i m going through </s>
<s> thanks all </s>
<s> po </s>
<s> looking at your sound blaster from the back of the computer the far right plug is the digital out jack </s>
<s> it supplies a digital signal via an 1 8 quot plug and your stereo supplies the dsp digital signal processor </s>
<s> if you go with computer speakers the sound blaster will handle the dsp </s>
<s> basically digital is a rehash of an old idea where more than one channel of music is present </s>
<s> remember quadrophonic stereos of the late sixties and early seventies </s>
<s> this time around you only need a right and left channel each with a digital signal and a processor recreates the multiple channels based on the digital information </s>
<s> every listener has different tastes in what sounds good to them </s>
<s> for instance i like a lot of high end in my music whereas some folks find it to crisp that way </s>
<s> i also like a deep rich bass and some folks find that annoying </s>
<s> my best advice is visit a brick and mortar store with displays set up and find one that suits your ears then try to duplicate the setup at home </s>
<s> keep in mind that sounds are effected by space and objects in that space so it may not sound the same at home </s>
<s> the good news is your sound blaster can recreate a wide range of spaces to try to mimic different settings </s>
<s> good luck </s>
