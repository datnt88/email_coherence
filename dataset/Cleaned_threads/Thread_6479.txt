<s> hi and i would really appreciate your help on this i have a notebook connected to the internet through wired lan and i want to share this over the wireless lan to another notebook </s>
<s> both notebooks have xp home sp2 </s>
<s> the host computer has the following wired lan has ics setting ip 10 0 15 </s>
<s> subnet mask 255 255 254 0 gateway 10 0 15 254 wireless ssid has been set to ad hoc with automatic ip and dns etc but shows as not connected client setting shows as connected to the ssid with ip 169 254 240 179 subnet mask 255 255 0 0 gateway 169 254 240 179 now i don t know much but i definitely know that i shouldn t have the gateway as same as the clients ip and i m thinking that the host should show connection any idea what i need to do </s>
<s> will the laptop connect to </s>
<s> does the wired pc have a wireless card </s>
<s> if so you simply bridge wired and wireless within that pc </s>
<s> you make that pc an ap for the wireless laptop </s>
<s> i don t think i can sort out our ics settings </s>
<s> the gateway should definitely be the router s ip in any case </s>
<s> my old recollection of ics was that the hosting pc needed 192 168 0 1 and the other addresses were to be within that range </s>
<s> xp could have changed that but i m not sure </s>
<s> in any event your wireless laptop needs to connect to something and if the pc has both a wired and wireless nic the easy way is to bridge these and connect the laptop to that bridge </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> the host laptop is connected to a hub used by the whole apt building i just can t figure out why the host laptop won t show the connection whereas the client laptop will </s>
<s> i ve tried bridging the connection but xp won t let me as the host laptop s wireless connection is not connected apparently </s>
<s> but if you must try it firewalls protection software must be set by you to allow all this and you can see if this article helps gt i will not write at length here since ics is now consider a tarpit </s>
<s> not many escape so i don t go there anymore </s>
<s> thanks actually the article you are suggesting was the first thing i found when trying this and hence i have done exactly as the article that you have pointed to perhaps its easier that i give up </s>
