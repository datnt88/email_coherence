<s> hello i am an aspiring pc builder and after much researh i have come upon many questions </s>
<s> i guess my main question is this should i wait until vista and direct x 10 come out before i build my first system </s>
<s> will the new top of the line cards like the ati 1900 512 mb be direct x 10 ready or will a whole new set of cards come out just for dx 10 </s>
<s> thanks you </s>
<s> as for waiting that s a personal choice </s>
<s> the best cards in jan 07 will be better than today s cards but they will be superseded by the new batch in jul 07 </s>
<s> july 07 </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> so will all current cards up to that point become obsolete or just have to run things in dx 9 </s>
<s> isnt direct x just a thing you can download </s>
<s> they might but here is something to note directx 10 will be exclusive to vista according to the wikipedia article for directx </s>
<s> while yes you download directx it would be up to microsoft to list what is compatiable with what and if they decide that xp and directx 10 don t work together then they don t work together </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> my reference to july 07 was not when dx10 cards will come out but rather that waiting will always get you something better </s>
<s> but that something better will always be passe in the next few months </s>
<s> therefore you can wait for something better perpetually </s>
<s> dx10 cards should be out in dec 06 jan 07 </s>
<s> ok thanks for the reply </s>
<s> i understand about waiting you can wait forever and there will always be something else about to come out you must take the plunge at some point </s>
<s> this time though there is an entirely new operating system and dx 10 i guess i mean to ask is dx 10 so radically different that current cards will be incpable of running it or is is simply a matter of liscensing and money that will stop current cards from running it </s>
<s> i just cant imagine every card out right now suddenly becoming obsolete the day dx 10 is released </s>
<s> i guess another way to put it is this way when will game makers start really using dx 10 to make games </s>
<s> if 99 of the video cards out there are not dx 10 capable whats the point of even using dx 10 </s>
<s> they may as well play the waiting game and wait until a majority of users have a dx 10 card </s>
<s> ok i think i see waht you are saying </s>
<s> i do plan on getting vista so as long as i have vista i should be able to run dx 10 on a video card i buy today like an ati 1900 but if i keep using xp i shouldnt expect to be able to run dx 10 it all makes sense now </s>
<s> forgive me i am a little slow on the uptake </s>
<s> just like games today that employ sm3 0 and hdr lighting fall back to sm1 1 sm2 0 and bloom lighting </s>
<s> dx10 is supposed to require new hardware </s>
<s> but since nvidia is implementing some of its dx10 support at the driver level some folks suspect a quot magic quot driver could make a high spec dx9 card dx10 compliant </s>
<s> if this is truly possible or will ever happen is pure speculation </s>
<s> i think dx10 video cards are going to be like everything else </s>
<s> wait till after most of the bugs are worked out then buy </s>
<s> there are always problems with new os s even though the date got pushed back on vista </s>
<s> im going to wait until around march to buy a card </s>
<s> get the 8800 gtx or gts its a fully dx10 compatible card heres the links cheers </s>
<s> the graphics cards that are currently on the market for instance the ati x1950 pro and the nvidia 7900 gt even though they are top of the line don t support directx 10 wait for the nvidia 8000 series to be released </s>
<s> it costs 675 and will be available within a few months </s>
<s> and this card can handle much more than the previous gen pcie cards </s>
<s> its a kick but card in sli mode </s>
<s> it has 1 5 gigs of gddr4 memory in sli mode </s>
