<s> so far the solid states is doing very well do you have a different opinion about them </s>
<s> if you use your old ext </s>
<s> hds as in frequent in out use of storage it may succumb to the same hassles of failure </s>
<s> if on the other hand you simply store data it may work out ok also if older hds were handled wrongly or got roughed up then that too is why older hd tend to fail </s>
<s> while ssd may provide use in that situation look up the quot trim cmd quot to see why ssd can fail </s>
