<s> hi yestesrday i installed a new virus software it installed restarted it and the computer was acting weird so i switched it off </s>
<s> went to restart and nothing it just loops trying to start and then saying set up is being restarted </s>
<s> i have bought a cable to connect my harddrive so i can get the information off it so i can reformat the drive </s>
<s> however when i go to look at the information to get off it all the information is stored under my profile </s>
<s> which when windows loads asks me to type in the password </s>
<s> however now i can t get access to this folder it just tells me access denied </s>
<s> i know the password but it doens t give the option it just tells me access denied and i wanted to know if there was a way to get this profile password off as i really need the information on the hard drive </s>
<s> i am truely hacked off by this problem now and the fact that the virus software killed my computer never use bit defender </s>
<s> so any help to resolve this problem would be very gratefully appriciated </s>
<s> thanks ceri </s>
<s> yes people say to never call them in because sometimes the building is blown up </s>
<s> who knows if some pest decided to go nuclear as it spotted the install of an antivirus </s>
<s> i think you see the point </s>
<s> on to how i safely recover files </s>
<s> 1 i remove the old drive </s>
<s> 2 i install a new blank drive </s>
<s> 3 i install the os drivers and quot protection quot 4 the old drive is added to the machine and we copy off the files </s>
<s> 5 if xp complains we type quot xp take ownership quot into google com i m sure there are less safe ways but i don t trust them </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> however i have attached the old drive to my laptop and i can t copy the document and settings folder with my user account in because it says access denied </s>
<s> how will putting in a blank drive and reinstalling windows illiminate the problem i already have because i still wont have access to that folder because it is password protected </s>
<s> sorry for the questions i appriciate the answer i just want to be sure about things </s>
<s> that s usually it </s>
<s> honestly that can t be the only answer you can get information off the hard drive its just a matter of how and there must be someone who can help and tell me how to get to the files i want even though it has a password kinda embeded on it </s>
<s> sorry i missed the title that said see item 5 i will look into that </s>
