<s> i have a desktop that has adobe creative suite cs3 on it and i am no longer using that desktop </s>
<s> i have a new laptop but i lost the installation discs for the software </s>
<s> i was wondering if i could remove the hard drive from the desktop treat it as an external hard drive for the laptop and run adobe creative suite from there </s>
<s> if possible this will save me a lot of money not having to buy the software again </s>
<s> i imagine that i would have to change some settings somehow since the desktop boots from that hard drive but this is getting into territory that i am almost clueless about so i would appreciate any assistance helping me do this if it is possible </s>
<s> my desktop is running windows xp professional </s>
<s> my laptop is running windows 7 64 bit </s>
<s> if more information is needed please let me know </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> program installations will put files in the windows folder and will make entries in the registry </s>
<s> it needs these to run </s>
<s> one of the big upsides of registering software we paid for is the lower cost of replacement cds </s>
<s> cheap compared to the alternative </s>
