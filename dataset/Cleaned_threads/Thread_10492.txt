<s> we are in the process of migrating from small business server 4 5 to small business server 2003 we have quite a range among the 20 or so workstations in our company a couple of laptops with 512 mb ram and 2 0 2 5 ghz processors a slew of workstations in the 600mhz 1 4 ghz range with 256 mb of ram and 4 windows 98 se computers with 400 600 mhz and 96 or 128 mb ram all the other computers are win xp pro sp2 </s>
<s> we had the network setup and the emails migrated and started to convert the workstations to the new domain </s>
<s> we were very surprised to see how long it took to login </s>
<s> some of the computers took up to 10 minutes to log in hanging on things like quot computer settings quot and quot personal settings quot </s>
<s> it was not totally a function of speed and ram which the 2 laptops did come in the fastest it still took about 3 5 minutes </s>
<s> surprisingly the win 98 computers were next at about 5 7 minutes though they would also crash a lot after using the network a bit then the rest of the win xp machines </s>
<s> when we reverted the machines back to the old domain they logged in quickly like they used to </s>
<s> the guy who helped me setup the network thinks simply getting all the computers to 512mb of ram and replacing the 4 win 98 computers which was being planned anyway will magically fix this but i m somewhat skeptical </s>
<s> could it be something about the new network server </s>
<s> or 2 sbs machines running at once </s>
<s> any thoughts on what to look for are welcome thanks </s>
<s> you will find that as versions go up so does the hardware requirements </s>
<s> nothing new here </s>
<s> if you must keep old hardware you don t want the new os </s>
<s> the machines that crash are telling however </s>
<s> crashing machines can be murder on your bottom line </s>
<s> moreso than a new non crashing machine </s>
<s> repairs on such here cost more than a new machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the fact that even the laptops had some amount of delay makes me think it s more than that though upgrading would certainly help </s>
<s> i saw one forum that mentioned something about setting dns for your local server vs that of your isp being part of the problem </s>
<s> again while the win 98 computers were definitely set for replacement anyway just want to make sure we don t want to buy upgrade everything else and still have the same issue thanks </s>
<s> if you see a lot of local hard disk access then more ram may help </s>
<s> then again it s quite rare to see windows machines with up to date bios and drivers </s>
<s> the crash is abnormal and a clue that something is wrong </s>
<s> our old machines never crashed on boot like that </s>
<s> we had to push them very hard </s>
<s> i would not upgrade a crashing machine </s>
<s> adding ram will not stop the crash </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> wow that was fast </s>
<s> anyway i m thinking more of what in our company are the quot middle quot machines i m pretty sure with the 4 crashing computers they are too slow for the new network </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> something is amiss with those machines </s>
<s> we didn t crash even on 98se connecting to 2003 server </s>
<s> but then again we we pretty in tune with bios drivers no spyware pests etc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> 2 of the 4 machines had problems not nearly as severe on the old network </s>
<s> and as i said i had plans to replace them not long after the network upgrade so now i ll just replace them before </s>
<s> but again i m wondering what the issue is with the win xp pro machines </s>
