<s> everyone here seems to be well versed in the online persuit of computer hardware so here is my question where is the best place to buy a complete system online </s>
<s> my concerns in order of importance are price customization and customer service </s>
<s> i m a casual gamer at least moderate performance is a must </s>
<s> i have shopped around at various places but i want to make sure i m getting the best deal i can </s>
<s> thank you in advance for any info ideas </s>
<s> casual gaming leads to more gaming leads to more money for better computer and or graphics </s>
<s> yeah the casual gaming is mostly world of warcraft it eats up some time but i m definitely not too hardcore </s>
<s> thankfully blizzard had the insight to make wow playable on some lower end machines </s>
<s> if i could get a machine no moniter i have a 17 quot lcd which i love for 800 bucks or less that would be super </s>
<s> don t laugh i know its possible </s>
<s> any ideas here </s>
<s> the cheaper the better i just don t want garbage either </s>
<s> you make price first priority that is exactly why when you buy a case with a power supply the supply is usually crap </s>
<s> it s known as low bidding </s>
<s> try at least you are dealing with competent people and know how to build a gaming system </s>
<s> the power supply w most boxes i have seen is 420w sometimes 350w </s>
<s> i would rather spend the extra 50 80 bucks to go to a 500w from a decent manufacturer </s>
<s> you are right though quot price first quot is a dangerous mindframe </s>
<s> where would you think i could cut my cost a little bit </s>
<s> i don t need dual dvd cd drives media card readers zip drives blah blah blah so thats a start </s>
<s> but where else can i save money </s>
<s> own i gave you one good link </s>
<s> they will put in only those items that you want and check it out completely </s>
<s> you are doing the design </s>
<s> there are more that will do that </s>
<s> i personally don t buy from tiger direct because so much of their stuff is bought from mfrs unsold overstock stuff </s>
<s> i once bought a bunch of creative labs cd rom s from them </s>
<s> little did i know that those drives were crap and creative unloaded them </s>
<s> threw them all away </s>
<s> but if you know the specific items you can get some good deals from tiger </s>
<s> i buy virtually exclusively from newegg they and their shipping is great </s>
<s> just don t buy little stuff from them the way they price shipping on each item can really hurt if you want to buy like 10 ribbon cables or such </s>
<s> 1 80 per cable 3 70 each to ship maybe tapers to 3 00 per cable for 10 lol </s>
<s> just realized i m talking to the same person over in the desktop forum with almost the same buying question </s>
<s> check over here for some of my comments </s>
<s> i wasn t sure which forum would be best so i figured i would save myself the trouble and use both </s>
<s> i d suggestyou build your own </s>
<s> right now there s a free course forming on cnet that covers building your own computer </s>
<s> it s for a high powered gaming system but the principles are all the same only the components would be different for a slower system </s>
<s> you can get mobo and processor combinations pretty cheap </s>
<s> if you have a micro center near by you can go look at the mobo and decide what you want need </s>
<s> shop online for the operating system </s>
<s> that s been my only complaint with newegg </s>
<s> i buy 98 of my online stuff there and the shipping can be irritating </s>
<s> i needed multiple items once but cancelled the order because they wanted to charge shipping for each little item and not on the whole order like most suppliers </s>
<s> just venting </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> for that other stuff </s>
<s> i had a big order lots of small stuff with cyber and had to call about a credit card question sending to a different address </s>
<s> while checking to correct the problem the girl noticed the shipping cost and said quot we can do a lot better than that quot and reduced it substantially </s>
<s> i appreciated that </s>
