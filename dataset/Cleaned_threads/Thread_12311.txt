<s> hi all i work in a production facility and a majority of my day is spent away from my desk either in meetings or out on the production floor </s>
<s> while i am on the floor i get a lot of questions i am not able to answer because i cannot access my email microsoft outlook sharepoint sites sap etc </s>
<s> this causes me to have to take notes walk back to my desk and then follow up with the person later on </s>
<s> this creates a lot of wasted time in my day </s>
<s> i also use sap heavily </s>
<s> i was wondering if there are any tablets that are capable of doing a remote desktop back to my office where i could then use sap on the floor </s>
<s> if i was able to do a remote desktop it would probably be the best for me so i could keep all files on one computer and only use the tablet to link to my office while on the floor </s>
<s> i would assume a tablet could not support having its own sap program therefore i am pursuing the remote desktop </s>
<s> so my question is there a tablet capable of remote desktop connection which is reliable and able to use sap through the connection </s>
<s> i would assume most any tablet could connect to sharepoint sites or microsoft outlook so my biggest question is being able to use sap </s>
<s> i also have a laptop but it does not work well on the floor because i usually do not have a place to set it down to work </s>
<s> this is why i am pursuing the use of a tablet </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> plenty out there </s>
<s> if you mean best panasonic toughbooks are best for such things </s>
<s> example at bob </s>
<s> you could also try the asus ep 121 which is a windows 7 tablet </s>
<s> i have one that i use both for home and work which provides more versatility and flexibility </s>
<s> only disadvantages are its weight of 2 6lbs battery life of 3 0 3 5 hours and of course the price of 1199 00 for the 64gb version which i recommend </s>
<s> i comes with a leather cover and bluetooth keyboard with pen for writing </s>
<s> i saw this post and thought i d answer even though i am a year late </s>
<s> i have been using quot jumpdesk quot app on my ipad my iphone and my acer mini to get work done on the fly </s>
