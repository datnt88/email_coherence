<s> when i search through the web i always see ddr memory with some numbers assigned to them </s>
<s> for instance 256mb ddr memory pc3200 400mhz or pc2700 333mhz </s>
<s> as far as i know even the motherboards supporting 333mhz can work with 400mhz memory but in this case the memories will function at 333mhz thus buying memories at a higher than supported speed becomes useless </s>
<s> how can i understand whether my motherboard supports 400mhz ddr memory </s>
<s> describe your motherboard as in manufacturer and model </s>
<s> the mtrbd </s>
<s> specs are provided via the manual or the support website for your model </s>
<s> understand the memory mapping as sometimes certain conditions must be present </s>
<s> in general if the mtrbd </s>
<s> supports fsb of 333mhz </s>
<s> though you can install ddr pc3200 400mhz you can use it only at 333mhz </s>
<s> if the mtrbd </s>
<s> can in fact use pc3200 at fsb of 400mhz in may want certain memory slot s used only or all are supported </s>
<s> also the level of the cpu class installed will determine the final setup as the mtrbd </s>
<s> using its quot automode quot setting may pick the best overall operation or at least the safest one with lack of problem s </s>
<s> these mtrbds </s>
<s> can be in most cases be quot manually quot setup to increase its operational speed but may lock up or outright fail if pushed too far but a default mode should recover it </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
