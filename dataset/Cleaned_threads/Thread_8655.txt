<s> hi i have never purchased external hard drive and have no knowledge in this area </s>
<s> that s the reason i am here gt actually my requirement is as follows i am looking for a 100 150 gb hard drive in which i can save personal data </s>
<s> i will be carrying it with me most of the time therefore it should be quot rough and tough quot hardware </s>
<s> connecting with my notebook just to swap copy paste data between laptop hard disk to external hard drive </s>
<s> i mean not connecting for long time max connection time will be an hr </s>
<s> personally preferring that it has strong enclosure so to avoid any jerks or fell down effect on hard drive </s>
<s> and a fan to make it remain cool </s>
<s> i will be connecting it with compaq nx7300 intel core2 duo xp professional notebook </s>
<s> please advise which is the best one to go for </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> bye viki </s>
<s> and will eventually fail </s>
<s> maintain your backups as you always have </s>
<s> gt try these bob </s>
<s> you can decide which mfgs to exclude </s>
<s> might be worthwhile putting some of your important can t afford to lose data on dvds </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> lacie rugged looks good specially with rubber to avoid shocks </s>
<s> what about maxtor onetouch 4 mini and seagate freeagent go </s>
<s> any idea about this </s>
<s> bye viki </s>
<s> why would we compare those </s>
<s> actually to be honest i have no idea in hard disk world </s>
<s> specially external drives 2 5 </s>
<s> in 2002 i bought 40gb barracuda iv 7200 rpm </s>
<s> and it was recommended on internet and had good review rating those days </s>
<s> i found it very good </s>
<s> similarly i find some good rating for maxtor and segate freeagent go on iinternet </s>
<s> that s the reason i asked for either one </s>
<s> well do lacie has internal fan </s>
<s> and what is global rating of it </s>
<s> your help guidence is highly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> bye viki </s>
<s> i find a good external case aluminum for heat dissipation and with a fan </s>
<s> then i add a seagate pmr perpendicular magnet recording drive my latest is a seagate 450 gig pmr drive </s>
<s> pmr because it s faster than the lineal recording drives </s>
<s> all my other internal drives in my three pcs have been upgraded to seagate pmrs </s>
<s> i don t like the complete drives because of the extra bells and whistles that can cause problems </s>
<s> i just use the drive as a temporary backup </s>
<s> every so often i burn my backups to dvd media </s>
<s> pmr speed as my own tests </s>
<s> i download video files ranging from 800 mb to 1 gig in size and move them to my home server for storage </s>
<s> with my old seagate lmr drives a one gig video file across my gigabit network would take between two and three minutes </s>
<s> since i have upgraded all my drives to pmr the same size file takes 45 seconds or less </s>
<s> nuff said about pmr </s>
<s> wayne click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about analog and digital data internet connections spyware removal and download free software </s>
<s> my mini schnauzer is smarter than your honor student </s>
<s> there are very few models that fit your initial spec </s>
<s> if you want to change that and your price point then i d start another discussion </s>
<s> wayne thank you for sharing your experience </s>
<s> the difference b w pmr and lmr you mentioned really matters </s>
<s> i am not sure whether pmr comes in 2 5 laptop hard drive </s>
<s> proffitt what you want me to change in my req </s>
<s> specs </s>
<s> by rough tough i simply mean the hardware enclosure and disk itself should not be delicate </s>
<s> the best e g i can give is of nokia 3310 model </s>
<s> i dropped down 3310 many times free fall but it always worked better than before </s>
<s> i am not saying hard disk should possess same attributes as of 3310 but at least designed and tested for handling jerks free fall and other physical external force </s>
<s> my range is 100 150 </s>
<s> this could go up as most as 200 but in very rare exceptional case </s>
<s> just to reiterate i m looking for 100 150gb storage </s>
<s> i thank you for your recommendations and help </s>
<s> bye viki </s>
<s> i m taking the view of how many employees treat the equipment </s>
<s> only those units i noted meet the rough and tough as you asked </s>
<s> gt for those that don t abuse the drives i suggest you shop for a drive case and then put a drive into it </s>
<s> not much harder than changing some lightbulbs </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> 150 is a very practical range esp if u shop at newegg com great service </s>
<s> a lot of free shipping </s>
<s> no hassle awesome return policy </s>
<s> they sell oems tho </s>
<s> anyway i know apricorn and seagate are good companies </s>
<s> i heard about lacie being good but i never see one first hand </s>
<s> just dont get maxtor </s>
<s> but my real suggestion is use of an external encloser </s>
<s> get an aluminum enclosure with a fan from mapower and a good seagate internal harddrive and ur ready to go </s>
<s> think it d be a bigger bang for the buck too and not as much bucks lol </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
