<s> i am planning to but a external hdd i read the specification it say formatted to quot fat32 quot </s>
<s> i did a further research and came to know it cannot store files more than 4gb unless i convert the drive into ntfs </s>
<s> i have couple of movies in hd 5gb each </s>
<s> i will be using the drive mostly with windows xp and vista systems and occasionally with mac 1 is converting to ntfs a good idea </s>
<s> 2 is ntfs better then fat32 </s>
<s> if yes then why the manufacturer is not selling the drive in ntfs </s>
<s> 3 any issues with ntfs format </s>
<s> it s because it is more universal almost any os can read them </s>
<s> 1 that depends on the device that you will use it on </s>
<s> if all can read and write to ntfs then it s a very good idea </s>
<s> 2 i think you can say that </s>
<s> 3 none that i can think of </s>
<s> i am planning to reformat my hdd to ntfs didnt find any issues with ntfs still did not understood why manufacturer does not gives it in ntfs </s>
<s> you may be able to use the quot convert quot command and not need to reformat the drive </s>
<s> if you have data on the drive it should be safe but you do want to back it up anyway </s>
<s> i know xp and win 7 can do this </s>
<s> i don t know about vista but presume it can do so also </s>
