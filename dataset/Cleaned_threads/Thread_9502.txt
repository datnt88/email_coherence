<s> i m building a pc pretty soon </s>
<s> i want to overclock my cpu not a lot </s>
<s> maybe 200 or 300 mhz </s>
<s> i m going to get an amd 3500 on socket am2 </s>
<s> my question is will any after market fan heatsink work with any processor </s>
<s> in particular will this cooler work on this motherboard with an am2 3500 </s>
<s> what i would do is goto the manufacturers websites i have no idea what am2 socket is lol </s>
<s> i dont think gigabyte make that heatsink any more </s>
<s> goto this link </s>
<s> if you want something to cool your cpu down </s>
<s> try asaka aswell </s>
<s> but goto the manufacturers site first </s>
<s> and also do some more research on am2 </s>
<s> a good place to start would be with amd </s>
<s> most cpu hsf setups are rated for thier highest level of usage </s>
<s> so if you get a fan for xyz 1000cpu and it becomes overclocked to xyz 1300cpu then you re really going beyond the rating of the fan </s>
<s> though a fan can take excessive heat don t expect all fans to do so and whatever quot quality quot means alot </s>
<s> thus some namebrnads fans are capable of handling oc ing but look for any rating label to match what you plan to oc to as a safe bet of sustained usage </s>
<s> remember you still have to quot exhaust quot the immediate heat build up as well to best serve any hsf to maintain its sustained rating or over time will fail </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
