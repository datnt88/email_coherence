<s> ok i would think this may be something that is solely about what a user wants but my question is this </s>
<s> currently i have a cdrw burner and a dvd burner installed on my desktop is this set up better than saying having just a dvdcdr combo burner </s>
<s> in other words which is best one burner or two </s>
<s> i put in a pair of dvdrw drives </s>
<s> the only reason for cdrw is if it s leftovers or quot free quot bob </s>
<s> two drives come in handy </s>
<s> i also like to have 2 drives so i can leave my current favorite game cd dvd loaded and always ready to play </s>
<s> cheap dvd burners aren t really that much more expensive than their read only counterparts </s>
<s> i have two dvd rw s and a cd rw which covers most eventualities </s>
<s> and i get to burn 2 disks at a time </s>
<s> but i d definitely go for two seperate ones it makes burning a lot faster in some modes and if one gives up you still have the second till you get a replacement </s>
<s> definately two dvd burners i use 2 and have done for a long time it is just easier to manage your burning jobs i use pioneer because i was told that they were the best by a technician at my local computer shop this is just a personnel choice now i also like that getting updated drivers is easy from the pioneer site </s>
<s> i have an internal dvd rw burner plus an external same </s>
<s> it s always good practice to have a backup </s>
