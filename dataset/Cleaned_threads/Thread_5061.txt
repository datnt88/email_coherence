<s> so i just got a motherboard to work with and i need some help with its graphics </s>
<s> it is a socket 775 motherboard with a pentium d 3 4 ghz </s>
<s> first of all its a 24 pin power supply slot in the motherboard but i only have a 20 pin power supply connected </s>
<s> i ve read that that shouldn t be a problem as long as i don t use any pci cards thus i haven t used any </s>
<s> however everything is hooked up as it should be and it powers on and everything but my monitor remains in standby mode </s>
<s> i tried to turn it off and turn it back on and that didn t work </s>
<s> i have no clue why the integrated graphics aren t working </s>
<s> does anyone else know </s>
<s> so after this all happened i put in a graphics card </s>
<s> however the graphics slot is pcie x16 and the only card that i have that will fit is a dual dvi e no problem i just bought a dvi to vga converter </s>
<s> so i put that in plug it all in and it still doesn t work </s>
<s> this is driving me crazy and i need to come up with a solution quick because this is my dads main computer </s>
<s> it s a shame the make and model of the video card was not supplied </s>
<s> some will never drive a vga display </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my bad </s>
<s> i tried it with a radeon hd2600pro 256mb ddr3 </s>
<s> if that won t drive a vga display thats fine but i still am wondering about how to get the integrated graphics to work </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> there are too many cards that fit your description but dvi does not mean and adapter will work </s>
<s> try a dvi or hdmi display next </s>
<s> for me to check further i ll need make and model number on that quot radeon hd2600pro 256mb ddr3 quot </s>
<s> i found the problem two of my ram sticks were ecc and i didn t know it </s>
<s> as far as the adapter goes i m happy to believe that the graphics card couldn t support vga </s>
<s> thanks all </s>
