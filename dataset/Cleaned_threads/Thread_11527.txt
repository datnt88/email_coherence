<s> i have a dell pc that i bought at a closing down sale and only cost 1200 </s>
<s> problem i have is that the digital cable i had to connect it to the monitor came with pc does not fit the back of the pc </s>
<s> this cable was already connected to the back of the monitor and both ends of this cable are identical and have a symbol that is identical to the symbol on the port on the pc </s>
<s> this symbol is the same as my sisters cable but in her pc she has a slightly different port </s>
<s> it s the same as in the back of her monitor </s>
<s> my problem is even though the symbol is the same is this a digital cable or not </s>
<s> i can t get the cable to fit it </s>
<s> thankyou all </s>
<s> see this link gt harumph </s>
<s> that shows at least four dvi connections and i ve seen at least one other with a cross instead of a bar in the c1 c2 c3 and c4 area </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the info but i found exactly the same thing in my search </s>
<s> problem is my connection in the pc is different i don t have the bar bit </s>
<s> just three rows across the connection with one hole missing on the bottom row 3 from the edge </s>
<s> still it has the digital symbol on face so it must be a digital connection </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> i m confused </s>
<s> as you can tell there are varieties to the dvi connection which can be all analog </s>
<s> to solve this puzzle you have to figure out what video card you have and your monitor s capabilities and get the right cable </s>
<s> however this information is missing so all we can do is look at the issue </s>
