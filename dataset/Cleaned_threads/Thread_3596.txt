<s> hey guys i was wondering is it possible to put an lcd and crt togther for dual monitor </s>
<s> if it helps at all this is my video card xfx nvidia 5200 mine is the same except it is 128mb instead of 256 i no this most likely isn t possible but just wanted to make sure </s>
<s> also would it be possible with a better video card </s>
<s> it s possible with your existing card provided you have a vga adapter for your dvi port </s>
<s> conect the crt to the vga 15 pin d sub use the analog adapter fits on the dvi port and makes it a vga 15 pin like the other one connect the lcd and configure them using the nvidia drivers </s>
<s> note you may want to update the nvidia drivers for your card from the nvidia website </s>
<s> once you ve accomplished this if you have trouble configuring the driver settings post back here and i ll try to help you out </s>
<s> ok i just checked on the net and i am 90 sure i can use a crt with an lcd togther in dual monitor setup </s>
<s> and i checked the box for the video card and i am 99 sure i can support dual monitor </s>
<s> my question is now if i am wrong about these 2 statements let me know </s>
<s> my main question is tho how would i use dual monitor </s>
<s> like would it play the game for example on both monitors or could i use one monitor for the game and another for another program </s>
<s> lastly ius it easy to setup up dual monitor </s>
<s> was both analog then a got a gard with both analog and dvi out and am running the lcd in gigital mode </s>
<s> paid a big 40 00 for the video card </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> ok so my question is if i go to play worldo f warcraft or another game will it play on one monitor and i can do whatever with the other one </s>
<s> you can move between the screens if you can run the game in a window </s>
<s> some games like wow allow you to do that </s>
<s> you just have to select that in the games video options </s>
<s> for the games that run in a window it s great so that you can im or run other apps at the same time as playing </s>
<s> after you go with dual monitors you ll never want to go single again it makes so many things so much easier </s>
<s> also i use a crt and lcd combination </s>
<s> my desk </s>
<s> as long as i play the game in a window i can do 2 things at once </s>
<s> what if i didn t would it be split across the 2 screens </s>
<s> also what about regular programs </s>
<s> like say i was using mozilla and itunes at the same time </s>
<s> could i make it so one monitor has itunes on it and one has mozilla </s>
<s> also whatever i did on one monitor would it happen on the other </s>
<s> like if i am on mozilla on the crt and i moved my cursor to say close the window would it be moved on the other one as well </s>
<s> if not how would i switch between monitors </s>
<s> sorry about all the questions i am just very new on this whole thing </s>
<s> it really depends on how you configure your monitors if you set it up to span two monitors you actually have one large desktop </s>
<s> if setup as clone you ll have two monitors showing the same desktop </s>
<s> anything you do on the primary monitor would only be cloned by the secondary a whole new world of computing will open up for you when you go dual monitor </s>
<s> and don t worry about making any mistakes nothing you can do on screen can damage your monitors </s>
<s> its pretty easy enough to understand when its already infront of you </s>
<s> try it then tell us how it went </s>
<s> life is good </s>
<s> after you install the second monitor and reboot it will be running in clone mode identical display by default </s>
<s> right click on the desktop and select properties </s>
<s> select settings </s>
<s> you should see two monitors 1 and 2 </s>
<s> below the monitors should be two check boxes probably greyed out </s>
<s> if you see two monitors click on quot 2 quot the two checkboxes should now be available </s>
<s> select the second box extend my windows </s>
<s> full screen applications like wow will run on one monitor only but will change the resolution of both monitors </s>
<s> maximized apps like mozilla will maximize in one screen only but can be dragged to whatever screen you want </s>
<s> you can also resize them manually to both screens at the same time </s>
<s> be aware that although you can have different resolutions on each monitor i don t recommend it </s>
<s> it makes screen swapping much harder to get used to </s>
<s> with two monitors you will be able to have say your word processor and web browser up at the same time </s>
<s> moving between them is easy just move your mouse to the monitor of your choice </s>
<s> it s like an extension of your desktop </s>
<s> gwee </s>
<s> inital set up can be a little intimidating gweezel gives a good explaintion on setting up your monitors </s>
<s> some one else posted that after using dual monitors you will never go back to one </s>
<s> to this i will agree </s>
<s> set it up and enjoy bill </s>
<s> but how do u guys play games with an lcd and crt on split screen doesn t the big gap in between annoy u </s>
<s> or do u just play it on 1 screen </s>
<s> purpose of dual or quad monitors is to allow multi applications to be open and seen at the same time </s>
<s> your choice on laying out which applications will open on which monitor </s>
<s> game on one im e mail on the other </s>
<s> in my case left monitor gt thunderbird msn yahoo messenger center gt primary tasks right gt files and using other applicatiions for internet reference comparision creating documents </s>
<s> 4th monitor is for show and tell hanging on wall across from desk </s>
<s> helpfull </s>
