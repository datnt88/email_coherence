<s> i have dual displays on my pc and would like to add a third and i m seeking advice on what i need hardware wise </s>
<s> i have the monitors </s>
<s> i just need an appropriate video card i e </s>
<s> a second video card </s>
<s> i don t want to spend much money on this </s>
<s> here are my specs i m running 64 bit vista to be upgraded to 64 bit win7 shortly </s>
<s> it s a dell studio xps core i7 pc </s>
<s> i believe this is my motherboard my current video card is an ati radeon hd 3450 it handles two displays fine </s>
<s> ideally i would have dvi and vga connected monitors to this video card 1920x1080 and 1680x1050 i would like add a third monitor which i have already 1600x900 </s>
<s> from what i understand i can do this by adding a second video card </s>
<s> but i don t know what to buy </s>
<s> i know an internal video card has to be compatible and can t go beyond what my motherboard and psu can take </s>
<s> but i know there are also external usb video cards and i m wondering if one of those would be the way to go </s>
<s> i m not into gaming but i do video editing </s>
<s> the ati card works fine for such purposes </s>
<s> so my third display will be used for work displaying documents web browsing etc </s>
<s> i would have no problem unplugging the usb attached monitor during video editing if need be </s>
<s> so i want a cheap solution that will allow for a third display one that will support the resolution and give a decent picture and not impact the quality of the other two displays </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you could fret about the compatibility i don t or move forward </s>
<s> that is i can t assuage fears here but if i wanted another display as you noted i d get a pcie x1 video card newegg and amazon have them then pop it in then install the drivers </s>
<s> or i d look at the sewell usb video solutions </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my radeon graphics card also has an hdmi port </s>
<s> so it has dvi hdmi and vga </s>
<s> does that mean it can support 3 monitors </s>
<s> i ve yet to see one that allows all three to be used like you wanted </s>
<s> can you give me an example of a pcie x1 card i could buy </s>
<s> i m not sure what pcie x1 means exactly </s>
<s> i m assuming that it has something to do with the fact that there is only one slot on my motherboard that is the specs that fit my current graphics card </s>
<s> here s the 5450 on newegg </s>
<s> the pcie x1 is what those slots on the motherboard are </s>
<s> if i were to bet the x16 slot is in use but i can t tell from the post so far </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if you look at my motherboard in the above link it s the one plugged into slot 25 so the one you re recommending would be plugged into slot 27 or 28 right </s>
<s> and they d both be in use simultaneously </s>
<s> just to follow up i d rather spend less money </s>
<s> what s the cheapest one i could get that would work on my system with a 1600x900 monitor </s>
<s> second will my psu have enough juice to support 3 displays </s>
<s> i think you can figure out that </s>
<s> as to cheapest you go shopping </s>
<s> i only go as far as this then you get to do the work </s>
<s> sorry if that upsets anyone but this is all volunteer and i only go so far </s>
<s> the juice issue is a good question and why i picked this card </s>
<s> so you don t have a juice issue unless there is more added to the machine that we know about </s>
