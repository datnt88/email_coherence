<s> i need to transfer docs from my ancient but reliable quadra 700 to a new g5 imac </s>
<s> i ve been told to use an ethernet transceiver cable </s>
<s> anything else i need to do to make this work </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> does the 700 get on the internet </s>
<s> you could use gmail to make a draft email then attach files </s>
<s> just don t send it </s>
<s> then on the new machine look at your gmail and copy out the attachments </s>
<s> quadra has an internet connection but crashes continually can t seem to handle the data download </s>
<s> and many of the files i need to transfer are large graphic designer here </s>
<s> i was wondering if there were any software settings i d need to change if i went via cable </s>
<s> either way the machine would crash </s>
<s> ok the old fashioned way </s>
<s> go get a ftp server on your new mac </s>
<s> now ftp the files over fast </s>
<s> this is not to offer a course on ip addresses and networking or ftp use </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that you get an ethernet crossover cable and use it to connect the two macs together </s>
<s> on the quadra turn on file sharing and share the quadra hard drive allowing access to everyone including guests </s>
<s> connect to that hd from the imac and suck the files off of the quadra </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> many thanks to both of you for the suggestions </s>
<s> now i have a better idea of how to go about this </s>
<s> most appreciated </s>
