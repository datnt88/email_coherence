<s> hey all i have 3 500gb hard drives </s>
<s> i am trying to find a sata controller card that supports raid 0 stripping with a hotspare </s>
<s> if i remember correctly this is raid 5 can anyone here reccomend a card that will do this </s>
<s> i can t seem to find one out there </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> fast forward to today and the story hasn t changed much </s>
<s> still the same name and the article covers it all </s>
<s> awesome </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> by reading some of the articles it looks like raid 5 does support 3 disks </s>
<s> i was worried that i would need a minimum of 4 now i m going to do some digging and see what one i should buy </s>
<s> they tested a few but im still not quite sure if all of the controllers out there support only 3 drives for raid 5 only reason im worried is because the controller thats built onto my mother board doesnt support 3 you have to use 4 drives </s>
