<s> os s and boot disk etc </s>
<s> but linux loads and runs fine </s>
<s> my main question is how can i check the hardware compatibility with windows </s>
<s> any other suggestions are welcome as i have been trying to get this machine working for over a month </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> not clear from your message is this the only win2k disk you re using </s>
<s> if so perhaps it is damaged and some files are corrupted </s>
<s> did you try a reformat and clean reinstall </s>
<s> my next guess would be a faulty cd drive but if linux is loading that seems unlikely </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> finds prior discussions </s>
<s> all dance around cd copies dodgey cdrom drives overtaxed power supplies and more </s>
<s> you must have up to date bios and such to load windows 2000 linux is a sign the hardware is ready for linux and means that you are close but not ready for 2000 bob </s>
