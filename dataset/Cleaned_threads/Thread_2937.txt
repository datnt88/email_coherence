<s> i divided my hard drive into two partitions c which contained the os and d which would be for storage </s>
<s> some time later the windows 7 installed on c became corrupted to the point of no boot </s>
<s> i backed up everything necessary formatted d and installed a fresh copy of windows 7 there </s>
<s> it works fine and when booting boot manager gives me the option to boot windows 7 or windows 7 and selecting the first one boots the fresh install without a problem </s>
<s> note that the 217gb storage partition previously known as d is now known as c containing the fresh functional os and the 80gb partition with the old corrupted os is now d i don t know why they switched </s>
<s> a screenshot from disk management captures the problem i want to safely format d containing the old corrupted windows but cannot do so as it is the primary partition and the system partition </s>
<s> after formatting i wouldn t mind merging the partitions either </s>
<s> why not do just that and once done reformat the whole drive or wipe it clean </s>
<s> then reformat and make that whole drive available as quot c quot </s>
<s> all you re doing is safeguarding your old quot c quot drive data either by backup or save critial data you deem necessary </s>
<s> again once done reformat </s>
<s> in the install the os once it asks do you want to use the whole drive select yes and allow to reclaim all space </s>
<s> however i like to truly wipe it clean to remove all past anything and thus start fresh </s>
<s> once that s done i then reformat or install the os providing it reclaims all space and proceed </s>
<s> i use killdisk or dban free versions for disc wiping </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i want to format d which used to be c and d is currently the primary partition and the one containing the boot info </s>
<s> i cannot format it in any of the usual ways and if i circumvent the warnings and do so anyway my computer will not boot </s>
<s> i would like to get rid all of the old corrupt windows data in d and merge it with c without installing windows again there was no option during install to use the whole drive </s>
<s> since you don t want any data from the old quot c quot partition then proceed to use the same info i posted earlier for the current quot c quot drive </s>
<s> now you want to do w o clearing or making a mess but you already did that when you accepted the old quot d quot partition as quot c quot making this process diffcult </s>
<s> you have to start all over again and remove anything as in prior formats fat setup data etc in order to start fresh </s>
<s> once all that is done install os again and retrieve any data you saved back to re installed pgm </s>
<s> folders directories or simply from scratch again </s>
<s> no matter what you do outside of what i already suggested is going to be a hassle or require intense effort and still not be 100 sure it will work </s>
<s> if you acquire any s w to do this then you rely totally on it doing the job again you build on a framework of the old even if corrected </s>
<s> so if that s w if free and available get it otherwise you need some partition s w to do this </s>
<s> look at pm partition magic or similar </s>
<s> more than likely if it works will be a one time use unless repeated faults </s>
<s> hopefully one of the above should work </s>
<s> however in the time involved you can do this as i suggested and clean the mess and re install </s>
<s> imho partition manager and gparted i like </s>
