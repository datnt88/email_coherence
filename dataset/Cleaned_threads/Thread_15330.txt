<s> i have an almost 10 year old pc that i ve kept limping along but finally seems to have bit the dust </s>
<s> it simply won t turn on </s>
<s> a power supply failure is the most obvious reason however i never heard any noises coming from it nor did i get a burning smell </s>
<s> instead over the past week on other occasions when it wouldn t power on i simply unplugged the cord and plugged it back into a different outlet </s>
<s> i did this successfully probably three different times </s>
<s> so i m wondering whether this sounds more like a power cord issue rather than the power supply </s>
<s> yes i could simply purchase a new cord and try it out but thought i d ask first since i ve never heard of a power cord not working </s>
<s> by the way i don t expect to keep using the pc but it would be nice to access a few things that had not been backed up </s>
<s> you probably have access to another ac cord swap it your monitor one and retry again </s>
<s> i rarely have any incidents of bad ac cords far more bad psus </s>
<s> since you mentioned a 10yr </s>
<s> old system well can be time to replace if you can find another similar psu if not a better one should you want to repair </s>
<s> as for accessing any data files remove the hd and mount in ext </s>
<s> usb case and or similar adapter in order to retrieve </s>
<s> google for ada 2020 adapter or locate ext </s>
<s> usb cases that match your hd requirements </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks for the advice it didn t occur to me to use the monitor power cord </s>
<s> unfortunately that didn t work so i believe it s the power supply </s>
