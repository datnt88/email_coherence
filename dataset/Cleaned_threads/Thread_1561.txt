<s> hey guys i purchased a new seagate 500gb sataii 7200 10 16mb hard drive </s>
<s> it s my first time with a sata drive </s>
<s> i installed xp on it everything was working good </s>
<s> i then went to restart when i noticed that the pc wont boot all the time with this new hard drive </s>
<s> sometimes when i reboot it ll boot right into windows then other times when i reboot on the last page before displaying the windows loading screen it ll just sit with the little underscore in the top left corner </s>
<s> sometimes i have to reboot 5 times before it ll boot up </s>
<s> other times it ll boot up right away </s>
<s> i do not get any messages or errors and no weird beeps </s>
<s> any idea what i can do to fix this </s>
<s> it s simple enough to just keep rebooting but it does become a pain thanks alot </s>

<s> jumper hdd to satai </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> not sure try scanning for bad sectors maybe </s>
<s> just throwing ideas out there </s>
<s> try maybe a different sata connector on the mobo and see if that helps </s>
<s> the jumper was removed making it sataii </s>
<s> i ran seatools for windows and it passed </s>
<s> my mobo supports both sata and ii </s>
<s> i have plugged it into all of the other sata connectors to make sure and it still does the same </s>
<s> thanks guy any other ideas </s>
<s> if that doesn t work i d try setting the hdd back to sata retest </s>
<s> how current is the mb bios </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i have never updated the bios </s>
<s> should i give it a go </s>
<s> if so how does the program for windows by asus work for upgrading the bios </s>
<s> i d prefer to do it that way then via dos or whatever it would be </s>
<s> go to the asus site and post your question scenario in the forum for your motherboard </s>
<s> much easier to get specific you need there </s>
<s> i ve never used anything other than the dos version to update a mb bios suggest seeing the bios notes for your mb to see if they address the problem you re experiencing </s>
