<s> anyone know if it is possible to run your computer into your stereo similar to a cd player etc </s>
<s> i would like to be able to run my computer through it so i could listen to my audio files out of my stereo throughout the house </s>
<s> thanks for all the great insight on this board </s>
<s> can t remember the name of the cable has a headphone jack on one end red and white rca jacks on the other </s>
<s> connect the headphone jack into the speaker out from your pc and the red and white rca jacks into one of the aux inputs on your stereo </s>
<s> you would use the quot line out quot connection </s>
<s> as mentioned you will need one that splits the signal into the two channels </s>
<s> radio shack probably has such </s>
<s> however you will have some problems if the cable is of much length </s>
<s> the longer it needs to run the more likely it will pick up noise and especially 60 cycle hum </s>
<s> impedance match is important so check to be sure your line out and auxillary ports match in this category </s>
<s> get high quality cost more cables if you go further than 6 to 10 feet </s>
<s> if your stereo has input in the form of typical audio input the red and white holes you can go to radio shack and pick up a cable that has the headphone size plug on one end and the red and white ends on the other </s>
<s> i think this would be the most basic of all the solutions </s>
<s> good of you to repeat what has already been said </s>
