<s> but i already formatted my other hd where windows was once installed </s>
<s> how do i get it to recognize that it s gone </s>
<s> clint </s>
<s> in a dual boot environment these are the choices you get </s>
<s> what os are you running </s>
<s> some will fail in a reinstall of xp and simply create a dual boot </s>
<s> editing the boot ini file will solve the problem </s>
<s> do you realize how little information you have supplied </s>
<s> you at least have to tell us what os you are trying to install and a lot more info about the environment is also needed </s>
<s> with many os s you can wipe the drive and repartition it during install others you need to format the drive but you give us nothing to go on </s>
<s> how many hard drives in the system </s>
<s> sorry i have windows xp pro </s>
<s> it was also installed on the other hard drive </s>
<s> i accidentally installed it there when i was doing a re install </s>
<s> i formatted that drive but it still asks me to choose between the two quot microsoft windows xp professional quot os s </s>
<s> but it s only on my c drive </s>
<s> the d drive has nothing on it </s>
<s> hope this clears up the confusion </s>
<s> clint </s>
<s> physically disconnect the d drive and install to c </s>
<s> when you first get into the xp install have it delete the partition on c and recreate it do a quick format </s>
<s> with both of those steps you should be able to eliminate the problem </s>
