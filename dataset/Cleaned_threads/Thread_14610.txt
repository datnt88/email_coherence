<s> never moved a mobo before considering instead of modding the hp case to just move to a larger case </s>
<s> no idea how to make sure this mobo will be able to screw down into a new case or not </s>
<s> would antec cases advertised as quot up to standard atx quot mean that it will have screw mounts for a matx </s>
<s> or a uatx </s>
<s> they are the same thing correct </s>
<s> i really like the super lanboy and p160 especially the removable mobo tray </s>
<s> decent new cases provide multiple mounting post s as not all are needed to conform to whatever mtrbd </s>
<s> is out there up to a point </s>
<s> you may get lucky and use enough mounting posts to align and maintain postion of the mtrbd </s>
<s> or be ok regardless </s>
<s> i suggest whatever case you get has a quot removable quot bulkhead an area where the ports are located </s>
<s> that way you swap a proper bulkhead to fit what the mtrbd </s>
<s> is configued for this is a physical item </s>
<s> if unable to match then leave quot off open quot and still have access to all ports </s>
<s> also decent cases provide a selection usually 2 bulkhead panels to choose from </s>
<s> if not various online vendors can provide that if available </s>
<s> this is the curse of oem type systems as they re made for thier needs and not necessarily conform to generic offering </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> in the mounting plate for the micro atx et al </s>
<s> panel for the i o s </s>
<s> they may not be standard overall dimension </s>
<s> if they are you should be able to take the one from the old case and snap it in </s>
