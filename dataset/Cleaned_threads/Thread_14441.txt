<s> hey guys i have a 500 gb wd external hard drive </s>
<s> it was working fine this morning but when i came home today i noticed none of the 3 partitions drives had any files in them </s>
<s> i shut off my computer and started it up again and i unplugged the hard drive from my computer and the power to it when my computer was shut down </s>
<s> it still doesn t work after i plugged everything back in and powered on </s>
<s> when i plug the hard drive into my computer s usb it still detects all 3 partitioned drives but i still can t see any folders on the hard drive </s>
<s> additionally the power button on the hard drive just keeps spinning indicating that its reading </s>
<s> when i click on the properties for the hard drive it shows used space and free space as 0 bytes </s>
<s> can someone offer some insight on whats wrong with it as well as how to fix it or is it just a brick now </s>
<s> if you didn t backup try titles like getdataback zero assumption recovery </s>
<s> sorry but forensics on this issue can be done but most won t pay for them </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> can you clarify what you mean about not paying for forensics </s>
<s> are you saying the manufacture can do forensics but they won t do it for free or are you referring to something else </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you asked for the reason this happened </s>
<s> given the details so far not much can be guessed </s>
<s> while we all know that many of these drives arrive in the rather fragile fat32 formatting your post is void of that small detail </s>
<s> there is also an issue of what happens if you plug that into someone else s machine </s>
<s> if you want answers they do cost </s>
<s> places like may offer that answer for a price </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yeah i formatted this to ntfs after i bought the hard drive </s>
<s> also what would the issues be if i plugged this to another computer </s>
<s> quot what would the issues be if i plugged this to another computer quot same as any other device </s>
<s> can become corrupt infected etc </s>
<s> all and anything that can go wrong can go wrong </s>
<s> its just one of the possible things that you would put on the list </s>
<s> how are the titles i listed working for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi it seems to me a logical problem </s>
<s> please don t create any new files and try some logical recovery program to retrieve the partitions </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> regards laura </s>
<s> hey i downloaded both of the programs you suggested but when i open them it does not detect the hard drives at all so i cannot run any diagnostics </s>
<s> this seems strange since my computer sees the 3 partitioned drives for the external hard drive it just shows no data </s>
