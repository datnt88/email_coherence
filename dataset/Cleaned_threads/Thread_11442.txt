<s> maybe i am just doing something slightly wrong but i am trying to make it so that i can be on my laptop and print to the printer that is in my home office and also have a shared folder that i can transfer files from my laptop over to onto my office pc </s>
<s> here is my setup motorola cable modem which goes into a linksys wrt54gs router from this point i have the office pc plugged into 1 port and a vonage phone adaptor plugged into another port </s>
<s> i am able to get the internet access on both the office pc and on my laptop when i connect wirelessly </s>
<s> i also have 2 printers connected to the office pc </s>
<s> i figured it would as easy as choosign to share the printers from that machine but i guess not </s>
<s> do i need a print server </s>
<s> do i need to send the cable modem into the comptuer first and then out to the router </s>
<s> i don t want to do this becasue i use the router for qos i would also like to be able to share a folder on the office pc so that if i work on a document on the laptop i can just copy it over to that machine for storage because i also backup everything on the office pc to off site storage </s>
<s> any advice on my setup </s>
<s> thanks tucker </s>
<s> first you have to make sure that the firewall is either disabled or if it is enabled that you have all the available ports open to the machine </s>
<s> secondly you have to make sure that they are part of the same workgroup </s>
<s> for some reason i ve found that they have problems when you don t keep them in the same workgroup and do basic file sharing </s>
<s> maybe i am not understanding this perfectly </s>
<s> you said check the firewall and the ports </s>
<s> are you saying on the router or on the computer and on which computer </s>
<s> is this to share the printer </s>
<s> also what ports do i need to open </s>
<s> do i allow these in the router or in the firewall </s>
<s> i use mcafee firewall by the way on the office pc and symantec on my laptop since it is a work pc </s>
<s> also how do i make sure it is part of the same workgroup </s>
<s> if this is more info then this forum can provide is there someplace i can go to get this info </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the network setup wizard on all computers and choose quot enable file and printer sharing quot this is also where you specify the name for your workgroup </s>
<s> hopefully all of your computers are running xp to simplify things </s>
<s> you will need to configure non microsoft firewalls </s>
<s> will running thw windows network setup be a problem becasue the laptop is my work computer </s>
<s> i don t want to mess it up by adding a new quot workgroup quot but that could also be why the shared printing isn t working </s>
<s> advice </s>
<s> sorry i neglected to understand that this is a work laptop and therefore a member of a different workgroup </s>
<s> but it s still simple to join your home workgroup when needed </s>
<s> hold down the windows logo key and press the pause break key </s>
<s> on the system properties box select the computer name tab and click the change button </s>
<s> select the workgroup option and enter the name of the workgroup you want to join </s>
<s> you will have to restart the computer </s>
