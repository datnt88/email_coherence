<s> i am having a problem with one of my first computer builds </s>
<s> it is all old parts i am building outside the case to test the main components the cpu w heatsink fan the memory the graphics card and the power supply </s>
<s> when i short the two pins to power up the computer the cpu fan runs fine however my video card pcie does not work </s>
<s> i have tried multiple video cards too so i believe this is not the problem of the video card </s>
<s> i think the problem may be with the power supply because when i plug in a video card that has worked in other pcs previously its fan does not even run </s>
<s> i am just looking for someone to point me in the right direction </s>
<s> might i need a new power supply </s>
<s> what is the best method to troubleshoot this kind of issue </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any and all help </s>
<s> and if not how about another motherboard </s>
<s> in other words what spare parts do we have </s>
<s> if none you can t troubleshoot this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> fortunately i work in a place of abundant spare computer parts </s>
<s> my first instinct was to try out other parts to attempt to isolate my bad part but having never done this before i was unsure </s>
<s> i ll give that a try </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> take a good machine and put the suspect part singular in </s>
<s> if no video it s that part or that part is misconfigured </s>
<s> examples </s>
<s> sure but since i can t see the machine i can t guess if these are good or bad guesses </s>
<s> ready </s>
<s> 1 the atx12v is unplugged </s>
<s> 2 the motherboard is one where the manual has the typographic error about the hdd led connection </s>
<s> there was many thousands of boards that came back but were fine if they unplugged that connection or read the updated manual </s>
<s> 3 the cmos battery is low </s>
<s> 4 the cmos clear jumper is on quot clear quot lots of reasons too many for me to list them all but i thought i d share my hit parade from last month </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> nothing will work without memory </s>
<s> if your memory is good and compatible with your motherboard you should get output on the monitor </s>
<s> if the monitor is good </s>
<s> a good test is to disconnect everything except for the motherboard with memory power supply keyboard and monitor </s>
<s> you should hear p o s t </s>
<s> beeps once </s>
<s> if it beeps more than once there could be some other problem </s>
<s> if everything is working properly you should see at the very least the bios message on the monitor </s>
<s> from there you can begin adding one part at a time until you hit the faulty part </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
