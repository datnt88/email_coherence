<s> i have window s vista and want to use my hp scanjet 3970 scanner to scan some old slides </s>
<s> i haven t been able to use it it in about 2 yrs </s>
<s> is there a tool i can download to have the scanner work on vista </s>
<s> the disk would not work when i fist got vista and now i need to use it </s>
<s> so you tried hp s drivers at </s>
<s> thanks for the link no i haven t tried it </s>
<s> it won t effect my other scanner lexmark will it </s>
<s> does this mean below only if 3970 was installed on vista which it didn t work on any </s>
<s> system requirements recommended uninstall any previous software driver for your scanner </s>
<s> as you suspect you ll want to make a copy of your system just in case </s>
<s> at least that s free </s>
<s> read and pick yours from </s>
<s> well now you have me worried </s>
<s> what are the chances that it would mess up my system </s>
<s> is it worth downloading </s>
<s> i m not that computer smart </s>
<s> i just want to download a tool if it works good if not well it just doesn t work </s>
<s> as you may suspect i m a bit fearless since i would have a backup ready </s>
<s> since you have another scanner must this scanner be brought back </s>
<s> and also look at what hp offered </s>
<s> it s a quot basic quot driver so who knows they don t tell and i don t own this scanner if they enabled the backlight for the film accessory or not </s>
<s> maybe this needs a test on another machine or you to learn if system restore on xp vista is functional on your machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob i sure liked this scanner that it scans negtives but i could go to wal greens thanks i will give it thought </s>
<s> but let me share one last thought </s>
<s> gt the cost of a trip to any computer repair or support counter pays for how many trips to walgreens </s>
<s> not that this is a good reason not to try but you wonder </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> your welcome and thanks for helping make up my mind i still loved that hp scanner guess that s life and the way things change </s>
<s> bob i have been thinking not good my old windows quot me quot that the 3970 scaner worked with </s>
<s> the last time i tried to use it would not power up any way to get the power start </s>
<s> i know but i can use the scanner i m trying to get pictures from some slides with out sending the slide off for a week or two </s>
<s> type the dead pc and you find the usual dead pc troubleshooting </s>
<s> i can t tell you exactly what and which part to change to suspect here </s>
<s> hut with xp and vista we do have system restore to fall back on if you want to install that driver </s>
<s> gt but first norton and some other antivirus programs or suites can have you do one more thing to get system restore sr to work </s>
<s> here s a search about that issue gt hope that helps bob </s>
<s> bob i haven t had a chance to try what you sugguested yet </s>
<s> thanks for links </s>
<s> i will let you know how i come out </s>
<s> hi have </s>
<s> the link to the basic driver for your scanner that bob provided should work for your scanner and not cause any problems with your other lexmark scanner </s>
<s> if for some reason you did run into a problem after installation you can always use windows system restore to roll your pc back to a time before the installation </s>
<s> thanks mr do i still haven t face the problem yet but if you think the tool for hp scanner for vista will work with out it causing problems i will give it a go </s>
<s> thanks for reading the post </s>
<s> as always everyone is so helpful i love coming to this forum it s the best </s>
