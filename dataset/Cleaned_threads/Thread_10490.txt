<s> i bought a emachine t2542 and know it didn t have an agp port </s>
<s> so i decided i would just buy a new motherboard to put a geforce fx in </s>
<s> i tried this and the computer doesn t boot winxp anymore </s>
<s> i m thinking emachine put something on the hd that detects the motherboard therefore stopping people from using there parts with other computers </s>
<s> maybe i didn t uninstall enough but i did uninstall the video sound and ethernet card </s>
<s> tell more if there is more to uninstall like ide devices or all the different intel controllers </s>
<s> i definitly need some help otherwise it s buy a new hd and windowsxp something i want to avoid </s>
<s> somebody knows the answer i hope </s>
<s> microsoft s oses don t handle all hardware changes with grace </s>
<s> in fact let s get some items out of the way so you understand these issues </s>
<s> 1 if the xp license was one for the e machine then some go ballistic as they find out that the os will fall and will not install on another machine </s>
<s> changing the motherboard may not be inside that oem license capability </s>
<s> 2 when you change the motherboard the current microsoft os xp may or may not work </s>
<s> there is nothing wrong with this except that people don t like that </s>
<s> there is no support from emachines if your os was a license from them and there is no support from microsoft to change the motherboard and have the os function </s>
<s> in spite of the above other people have written passages you can review to see if you can make it work </s>
<s> i ll offer these web sites in a moment but i want you to know that even i don t offer any hope that this os will ever work proper when the motherboard has been changed </s>
<s> i only support the clean install method because my experience has shown that any other course results in unhappy customers that come back too often </s>
<s> article and links at bon </s>
<s> such an o e m </s>
<s> pc will only work with it s original motherboard since the recovery cds will only have the drivers software for that motherboard </s>
<s> if one of the recovery cds is labeled windows xp then you might be able to use it to do a clean install on your new motherboard </s>
<s> you can give it a shot </s>
<s> the reason i stated that is i had performed a similar installation a couple of weeks ago </s>
<s> someone had wiped out the hidden recovery partition on a hp pavilion so could not do a recovery as no recovery disks were available </s>
<s> but the hp has the xp cd key on the side of the pc </s>
<s> i was able to use another o e m </s>
<s> winxp he cd from a dell dimension to install xp on the hp using the hp cd key </s>
<s> i have a user that lost her restore cd with her emachine </s>
<s> i can use my xp he cd as long as i use the key that is on the pc </s>
<s> it is an oem xp he btw </s>
<s> quot i have a user that lost her restore cd with her emachine </s>
<s> i can use my xp he cd as long as i use the key that is on the pc </s>
<s> it is an oem xp he btw quot the keys sometimes don t take on the foriegn version of the os </s>
<s> it s all in the plan to curb piracy of the os </s>
<s> it s also been noted that using another cd has resulted in the machine taking a fatal exception requiring a total install </s>
<s> proceed with caution </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> worked </s>
<s> activated just fine and i loaded all the proper drivers and runs nice for an emachine </s>
<s> as a bonus no emachine garbage littered throught the system </s>
<s> thanks for the warning </s>
