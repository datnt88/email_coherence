<s> i may be too young for this forum but i need some help deciding on a laptop for school related uses </s>
<s> as you may have guessed i am paying with my own money and am extremely limited by price </s>
<s> i dont know if anyone will want to hunt a laptop down for me but i need 1 gb of ram 12 quot screen gt 1 5 ghz built in wireless price below 1 000 as low as possible would be good anyway any help will be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks doc </s>
<s> sorry this is the wrong forum </s>
<s> still if you could help </s>
<s> boy how things have changed i can t remember ever needing a laptop all through high school and i m only 19 now </s>
<s> but yeah if you need an inexpensive laptop then dell would probably be in your budget </s>
<s> since you re not using it for gaming then 1000 should be more than enough </s>
<s> you may be looking for a mac though since you posted in the mac section but an ibook is slightly under 1000 before tax and will most definitly meet your needs </s>
<s> go for the acer aspire3003wlmi dvd burning 15 4 quot widescreen active matrx display wireless 80gb hd upgradeable ram upto 2gb etc </s>
<s> all for 699 it is fantastic </s>
<s> i m 14 look at dell </s>
<s> i d say the ibook is a nice fairly portable laptop you could probably pick one up cheap from the apple refurbished store the standard 12 quot ibook with 1gb ram is 1099 new </s>
