<s> nvidia gtx 285 </s>
<s> i checked one gtx 285 card and it requires 575w pci express compliant system power supply with a combined 12v current rating of 42a or more two 6 pin pci express supplementary power connectors or one 6 pin pci express and two 4 pin peripheral supplementary power connectors note for the power requirements of multiple geforce gtx 285 based graphics cards in an nvidia sli configuration please visit minimum system power requirement based on a pc configured with an intel core i7 965 extreme edition processor bottom line you need to pick a card get the specific specs and pick a good quality psu maybe a 700 or 750w psu </s>
<s> it pays to have the head room and an efficient psu </s>
<s> here s one 750w by corsair 99 00 after rebate vapcmd </s>
<s> vapcmd ty for ur answer but looks like the processor is not compatible with the mb so i had to make some changes i will go for a corsair cmpsu 450hx 450w tnx for ur time this topic can be closed now p </s>
