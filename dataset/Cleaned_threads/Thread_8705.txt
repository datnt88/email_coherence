<s> i bought an lcd monitor with a dvi d dual input and a vid card with a dvi i dual input and i have a dvi i single input picture for details the picture shows the cable in red the vga and lcd s complementary inputs in green and violet </s>
<s> now the dvi i cable won t fit into the lcd s hub but will fit into the vid card s </s>
<s> the only thing preventing fitting to the lcd is the 4 pins around the flat pin you see in the photo </s>
<s> would removing them manually cause any conflicts </s>
<s> because the alternative choice now is to buy a dvi d cable which has no pins around the flat thing </s>
<s> what do you think </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you have male single link while both connectors on the card and lcd are male dual link </s>
<s> i would buy a new cable </s>
<s> as far as i know a single link will also fit into a dual link hub </s>
<s> i know dual links provide higher resolutions but i m satisfied with my current 1280x1024 </s>
