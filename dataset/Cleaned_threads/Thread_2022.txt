<s> hi there ever so often my computer would not boot </s>
<s> when i press the on button the fans would start the motherboard lights would go on and thats it no beep no spinning hdd </s>
<s> and the light on my webcam woulb be constantly on </s>
<s> when i press the power button for a few seconds the computer switches off but the webcam still shows the light </s>
<s> however when i unplug and plugin the power cable again everything would boot up o k </s>
<s> without any alert messages </s>
<s> how can i solve this problem </s>
<s> the computer is home build </s>
<s> the next link will have pictures and tells about this issue </s>
<s> first the webcam scenerco isn t halepful </s>
<s> if this is a usb type cam its always powered by the system even when off maybe you noticed that whn initial power is just turned off </s>
<s> anyways usb devices with some telltale power led remain lit even when powered off </s>
<s> second i find a decent psu is the best cure for alot of weird or touchy issues </s>
<s> in no way does it fix everything but you got a stable powered system to proceed foward on </s>
<s> all too often the psu has been over stressed from system needs or itself was too underpowered in wattage </s>
<s> cheap psu s aren t capable for the long haul and or are misleading in thier wattage decal </s>
<s> its better to have a 600w cheap psu than a 500w one at least it may deliever longer even in less demanding systems before it fails </s>
<s> namebrand psu s are better to maintain power levels even if lower than cheap one at least they try to deliver stable power up to they fail not be so wishy washy </s>
<s> that s why they cost more but are worth it </s>
<s> i don t know you re power needs but at least get a 400w unit from the likes that suggests </s>
<s> as for true power needs try and take it from there </s>
<s> last when you unplug plug the ac cord that s not really good </s>
<s> the shock of that can be its own failure later try the power on off switch just press it in longer </s>
<s> i wouldn t discount what robert mentions in his post if you have a bad caps situation the mtrbd </s>
<s> has to be replaced for best cure </s>
<s> replacing caps can work too often unexperienced solder work will do damage </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thank you both for your replies </s>
<s> funny enough i never noticed that my webcam led is on even with the computer off </s>
<s> over the last 10 years i have upgraded build semi destroyed quite a few computers </s>
<s> most problems were selfinflicted jumpers leads or similar </s>
<s> my most recent kockup was to forget the atx power cable and spent days to find the cause of a quot dead quot mb </s>
<s> therefore i think there is something more or less obvious or simple again </s>
<s> those things are often difficult to spot because its so unbelievable obvious </s>
<s> the article with the caps is interesting but is seems i never had a problem with that </s>
<s> this problem happened with the same setup but two different mb s and psu s </s>
<s> i have currently a asus a8n sli premium heatpipe no cooling fan athlon 64 3400 with a large copper zalman cooler 2 gb ram nvidia graphics card passively cooled and wintek tv card </s>
<s> the psu is a 580w hiper very solid build </s>
<s> the computer and many peripherals are attached to extension lead with surge protection </s>
<s> it is that what is switched off to save electicity from all those stand by power consumers </s>
