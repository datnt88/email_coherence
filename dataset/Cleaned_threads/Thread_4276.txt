<s> i have a single level house with three laptops two of which are dell inspirons and one of which is an ibm thinkpad </s>
<s> i need a recommendation for a router that is much more focused on range than speed </s>
<s> the speed that comes out of the cable modem is fine for us as we don t do many speed intensive tasks </s>
<s> also i would like it to be easy to set up as i am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to techy stuff but not programmer smart or anything </s>
<s> thanks much </s>
<s> consumer oriented routers from linksys d link netgear etal will do </s>
<s> the only preference i would push is an 802 11g model vs a b model the added speed is nice for lan transfers </s>
<s> i believe g routers also have greater speed </s>
<s> was just too easy </s>
<s> i expected to learn a lot about networking through trial and error but each d link component cable modem router nics and wireless nics all found each other self configured and it was done </s>
<s> well maybe not that easy i had to input some data and set up home networking on the pcs but all in all the d link configuration was really a snap </s>
<s> just don t mix brands </s>
<s> good luck give a person a fish and you feed them for a day teach that person to use the internet and they won t bother you for weeks </s>
<s> click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about telephones internet connections and data and download free software </s>
<s> take a look at the belkin pre n router i have it and it does very well on speed and range </s>
<s> not too cheap though </s>
<s> ben </s>
<s> i checked out this one but it seems way too expensive </s>
<s> i may go for the parkervision vision </s>
<s> read my review </s>
<s> i can t stand this thing buying it was the worst money investment in my life </s>
