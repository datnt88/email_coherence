<s> for my graduation project as a senior next year for high school i decided to build a computer </s>
<s> normally i would wait until the end of august to construct it price drops but i want to build it sometime in july that way i have time to make sure nothing goes wrong and i can enjoy it during the summer </s>
<s> the one thing i m having difficulty deciding on is picking the cpu </s>
<s> because this system is more on the budget side i ll be using cheaper processors </s>
<s> i narrowed it down to the pentium 4 524 3 06ghz 1mb l2 cache w ht pentium d 805 2 66ghz 2x mb l2 or athlon 64 3500 2 2ghx 512kb l2 </s>
<s> i play games but not at high resolutions and this is my first build so i m not sure if i should handle an lga775 cpu </s>
<s> any suggesstions </s>
<s> sry i should have put this in but i m thinking athlon 64 due to heat from prescott and smithfield but i ll galdly listen to any other opinions </s>
<s> cpus will likely be a bit cheaper when conroe is out which is supposed to be next month ya know </s>
<s> even if you go with something older it may well be much cheaper after the new stuff comes out </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> i have a 3700 and the 3 0ghz ht the kid has is just a tad faster </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> all the p4 s that you re talking about have the 533mhz bus </s>
<s> if anything wait until after conroe is released amd will cut the prices of their dual core cpus in half </s>
