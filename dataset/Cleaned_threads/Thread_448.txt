<s> hello everybody i m asking for your help in locating a unique case for my next build </s>
<s> i m looking for the following features 1 right side window which means the mobo will be inverted 2 four usb connections preferably near the top that can be accessed without opening a door panel 3 two 3 5 external bays one for a floppy for sata one for a card reader 4 black silver or 2 tone 5 price range up to 139 6 power supply is optional 7 oh and something unique but not too flashy or dorky </s>
<s> lol i ve found a few but nothing that matches perfectly </s>
<s> two of the aerocools come close the masstige and the spiral galaxies </s>
<s> the silverstone temjin tj06 comes mighty close and the enermax cs 718 looks very good </s>
<s> since you guys are the experts i thought i d turn to you and see if there are any deals to be had out there that fit this criteria </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i can t advise you on your case but i do know that some motherboards have heatpipes that don t function properly when upside down </s>
<s> just making sure you have this issue covered </s>
<s> yeah i read that somewhere else </s>
<s> i m curious as to why turning the heatpipes upside down would decrease their ability to discipate heat </s>
<s> hmmm ok thanks for the insight </s>
<s> gravitational force is what causes air movement via natural convection </s>
<s> hot air rises can t use natural convection in a satellite because of zero gravity </s>
<s> btx type </s>
<s> why not stick with atx </s>
<s> intel has vertually failed to convince anyone to go to btx configiuration </s>
<s> else find a btx type mobo good luck </s>
<s> there is only one acceptable direction of the heat air flow to move heat from the cpu to the heatsink </s>
<s> thus the force to move the heated air is generated in the vertical legs of the heat pipes </s>
<s> inverting them would cause the flow in the wrong direction </s>
