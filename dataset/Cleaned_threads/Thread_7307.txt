<s> installed a new seagate sata hd in my wifes tower for more storage space bios is as current as possible so is windows xp </s>
<s> bios will not recognize hd as i did not install sata raid drivers last time i installed new ide hard drive </s>
<s> is there a driver for the asus motherboard of her a600n hp tower i can install without reinstalling windows </s>
<s> only added hd for storage </s>
<s> computer has 2 ide hd s now but there are 2 sata ports available minus the one for the new hd </s>
<s> hd is a seagate sata also </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>

<s> step 2 so far with no exceptions the bios must show the drive </s>
<s> any attempt to install drivers will only tax your time and patience </s>
<s> your product i see that you might enable a third master in the bios at however unless you find a document with the bios screen shots this is as far as i go </s>
<s> plan b install some card like this gt but beware that many don t want to flash the bios for the ide emulation so it will work </s>

<s> can i just switch the drive to an external with a case and copy her hard drive items she wants saved and then reinstall windows with the sata raid drivers </s>
<s> sorry if i was unclear </s>
<s> if the bios does not show the drives no driver known has helped </s>
<s> which makes me ask about the document on the machine s bios </s>
<s> if you can t find it why not take pictures for others to assist </s>
<s> why not enable the third master </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> install the oem dvd as per instruction follow the drive transfer section should be less than 20 mins job </s>
<s> proffitt several monthes later i finally got a chance to look at my wifes pc and installed windows 7 from a flash hd </s>
<s> i did what you said and looked over the other web shot you found stole a jumper from a old hd and bingo </s>
