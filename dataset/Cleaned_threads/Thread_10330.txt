<s> i ahve two computers that i leave on continuously </s>
<s> a 667 mhz hp and a 2300 mhz emachine i also have two printers and a scanner anyone know approx </s>
<s> how much energy in kilowatts this would be per month </s>
<s> figure 100 watts for under 1ghz machines 200 for above 2ghz </s>
<s> printers vary widely with my old laserjet ii sucking up 1 000 watts when the heater element kicks in to today s laser that sips 4 or less watts when just sitting there </s>
<s> if the printers scanners are newer guesstimate 10 watts each </s>
<s> if you feel you don t want to guess go to radio shack and buy the wall mount ac watt meter </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> let s assume that your computer has a 250 watt power supply and your monitor runs at 100 watts </s>
<s> for a 24 hour period the energy consumption for just these two items is 8400 watt hours or 8 4 kwhs </s>
<s> if these items are on for 30 days each month you are using 252 kwatthours per month </s>
<s> if we assume a conservative estimate of 0 10 per kwh from your electric company then you are spending 25 per month by leaving your computer running 24 hours each day </s>
<s> noted that 6 out of 21 supplies were not able to deliver on their ratings </s>
<s> as such the rule of thumb for a reliable pc is to fit a power supply that your machine will draw about 1 2 the rated watts </s>
<s> i d peg the 250 watt supply to on average consume about 100 watts on a pre built machine </s>
<s> and about 150 watts if the user upgraded the machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> most of the electricity used becomes heat </s>
<s> in the winter this actually means reduces the amount of heat your furnace needs to produce </s>
<s> in the summer if you have an air conditioner it works a little harder </s>
