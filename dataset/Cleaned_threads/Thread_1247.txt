<s> hello i have comcast internet and a dlink dir 655 router </s>
<s> i have a laptop playstation 3 and 2 blackberrys hooked up on my wifi </s>
<s> i also think my neighbor is using or trying ot use my wifi </s>
<s> i need a software program or piece of hardware that will allow logging of the url s that are requested through my router </s>
<s> i currently use opendns and the service itself is pretty good </s>
<s> however it doesn t tell which user is requesting which url and if a website is visited with 10 ads on it it also shows the url s for the ad hosting company even though they didn t actually type that url in </s>
<s> i know what a keylogger browsing history etc </s>
<s> is but i want to know what url s are being typed in by what user and i would prefer to have the url name resolved other than just the ip address </s>
<s> i have researched router logging by the actual router but it seems as if the dir 655 isn t very good at doing this </s>
<s> i have also tried wireshark and wallwatcher but they seem so difficult to use </s>
<s> i would love to find a good software program that has a simple interface that would allow me to turn off logging of certain devices such as the ps3 </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> but first all this is not easy stuff </s>
<s> you will find folk that want easy but this area is not </s>
<s> so look at the router and see if it supports sending information via smnp and then look for a software that runs on the pc to collect that data </s>
<s> finally you ll have to set up how to filter all that data </s>
<s> many folk are unaware that this is going to be work on their part if they don t want to pay a few thousand for a solution in a can </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> is there a special place i need to look to find out if it does support smnp </s>
<s> is there a piece of hardware that would do this rather than going through the software hassle </s>
<s> i look at the router maker s documentation for this </s>
<s> as to the hardware there are some but then again we are back to things very expensive and you know there is software under the hood </s>
<s> you may wonder why there is no simple to use software like this </s>
<s> it s a very simple reason </s>
<s> the support would cost more than folk will pay for </s>
<s> that is folk that can do this use the free tools </s>
<s> those that want it often do not want to know how to configure it and then may grumble about the cost </s>
<s> sadly this means that no one has a simple system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> do you know of a router that has good logging software </s>
<s> my dlink has a logging option but the options are lacking bad </s>
<s> if i could find a good logging router then i could use wallwatcher or some other program that converts the ip s visited into url s </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> and more if you get the software </s>
<s> ip s are not urls </s>
<s> i guess you need an example </s>
<s> so now you see that an ip address does not prove a thing </s>
