<s> can someone help me on this i have a emachine computer and i had the monitor plug pulled out of the back of the computer now i can t use the monitor anymore i tryed to put it back in but forget that </s>
<s> so is there a usb plug that can be connected to the monitor and the computer or do i have t get a whole new mother board </s>
<s> richard </s>
<s> the cables are specific to the monitor in question </s>
<s> in other words they re not that generic </s>
<s> you still hadn t explain your problem does the monitor work </s>
<s> have you tried anything yet </s>
<s> is the monitor cable at the monitor side or at the video port </s>
<s> if not you maybe able to return cable provide no real physical damage is done just loose </s>
<s> otherwise disassemble the back cover and see what s what again only if you re capable </s>
<s> get back </s>

<s> yes the montior does work my son did not unscrew the video connector plug he puled it out and the who e thing came out of the monther board in the back or can i get another video card and install that will it work </s>
<s> richard </s>
<s> so what you are saying is the monitor port quot where the cable plugs into quot was yanked off the motherboard </s>
<s> fortunately you can buy a graphics card or basic monitor card and put one in </s>
<s> however i won t say there wasn t any damage to the motherboard itself further than where the port got yanked from but if you are lucky there isn t </s>
<s> paul </s>
<s> if the video port is ashew then yes you can replace it </s>
<s> you will need to quot disable quot the build in mtrbd </s>
<s> video and install a new video card </s>
<s> the new card should contain instructions for all this or at its support website </s>
<s> place electrical tape to prevent the video port from moving to possibility cause a short or whatever just keep it from moving </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thank you all for the info i will get a new card i was not sure about that now i no i can do that thanks again all richard </s>
