<s> i ve been recently having problems with my pc </s>
<s> for the past week it s been freezing up in the middle of using it but upon restarting it would be fine </s>
<s> until today that is when i tried restarting it and it says quot master drive fails quot and quot slave drive fails quot </s>
<s> the master is a 40gb maxtor hd and the slave is a 250 gb western digital hd i know should probably switch the master and slave </s>
<s> anyway i find it hard to believe that both drives would be corrupted at least at the same time anyway </s>
<s> is there any way to fix this problem or at least transfer my data to a new drive </s>
<s> i d prefer not to take it to the geek squad because they charge an arm and a leg so i d like to just do it myself if possible </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> as to data recovery that s so expensive that most won t get their files back </s>
<s> as to geek squad you usually only surrender money for them to tell you the drive has failed </s>
<s> go ahead if you must </s>
<s> again </s>
<s> just one drive at a time to see how that works and a new ide cable just to be sure </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> checked the capacitors </s>
<s> lot s of possibilities why not download the mfg s diags and see what they say </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
