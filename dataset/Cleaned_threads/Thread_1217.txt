<s> hi i have a recently new western digital portable passport harddrive 250gb that does nt seem to want to work when its plugged in it gives five beeps and then is not recognised by the computer </s>
<s> i contacted wd and all they could say to me is its broken send it back </s>
<s> anyone have this issue before any way to fix it </s>
<s> if not what kind of recovery software would you recommend to get the data from the drive </s>
<s> thanks for your help ger </s>
<s> i m going to give you the short version but you can read other posts to learn the path is new case and maybe software like getdataback or zero assumption recovery </s>
<s> also testing on other pcs is required </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi thanks for the response i have read a good few of the topics on this forum with similar problems to my own but am still no closer to fixing the problem after trying a few of the data recovery program suggested sadly none worked i took the hd out of the enclosure and put it into my desktop as a secondary sata drive then turned this drive to auto in the setup </s>
<s> however upon bootup i get quot error auto sensing secondary hard drive drive 0 quot click f1 to continue and it starts to boot but then resets i e </s>
<s> i never get into the os with the hd turned on </s>
<s> so i am still no nearer to recovering the data that is on the drive anyone else any suggestion that i could try </s>
<s> again thanks for all your help ger </s>
<s> i didn t see where you tried like others </s>
<s> i e </s>
<s> other usb case </s>
<s> as to moving to the internal i find most can t configure the machine proper or the machine s bios or manual is nearly incomprehensible when it comes to configuration </s>
<s> in those cases back to the usb case </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi again sorry if i missed some info have tried the external in different pd s but same problem have also got a loan of another enclosure and tried it in that and also no differnce so it sure seems that the problem is with the hd itself hope this helps my main focus is the recovery of the data i know i can send the hd off to a clean room etc but was looking for a fix i can do myself thanks again ger </s>
<s> is when you put the drive internally on the machine is that the os boots up and you see that drive in the bios </s>
<s> i can t tell where you missed a setting because the details are not here </s>
<s> if it s the usual ide drive i suggest we unplug the cd dvd drives and use that cable </s>
<s> i ll stop here and not write how to jumper drives what cable types etc bob </s>
<s> hi bob my main os is run off a sata hd and the external is also a sata drive so when i placed the external into the pc there were two sata drives present only therefore as far as i know there are no cable settings etc to worry about the only thing to be done it turn the drive to auto in the bios settings which i did the drive was read by the bios as a hard drive type with 0 capacity i e </s>
<s> it was not reading the hd correctly then on bootup it gave the error described above before it would automatically reset thanks for all your help ger </s>
<s> auto is fine but you have to immerse yourself in the bios of the machine and maybe rearrange which drive goes to which sata port number </s>
<s> usually the boot drive is connected to the lowest number port </s>
<s> but all this is not standard as i can sometimes set the bios to another port </s>
<s> you are very close to the solution </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hey bob i changed the ports in which the drive were set this time it did not get past the boot stage i e </s>
<s> it did not recognise an operating system which tells us that the ports were correct in the first place so i then took the hd and placed it into another pc with the os hd in the lowest port this time it acts as it was before i e </s>
<s> error message and windows starts to boot however instead of simply resetting itself it bluescreened </s>
<s> so seems like the pc simply wont take the hd have you any other suggestions toi get the data maybe our best method might be placing it back in the external and trying to access it through there </s>
<s> thanks ger </s>
<s> an external case to usb is a good idea </s>
<s> try a new case if the old case is suspect </s>
<s> hi bob yeah we tried a different case and it didnt work it looks like the pc wont boot with the second sata operational therefore i was suggesting putting it back into the case and using some more data recovery tools to get the data are any other tools we havent used </s>
<s> any other suggestions </s>
<s> thanks a lot ger </s>
<s> did you mean getdataback or zero assumption recovery didn t find the drive in all situations </s>
<s> if so then contact drivesavers com if the data is needed </s>
