<s> for example if i buy 256mb ddr2 kingmax pc2 4300 and add it to my board then it work on dual channel or not </s>
<s> check your motherboard manual for what is written about dual channel configurations on that particular board </s>
<s> although that is not an intel motherboard here is what intel says about it if you have a 256mb module in each of the slots that makes up channel a you would then need to install a 512mb module in channel b to match the total in channel a if adding just one module </s>
<s> of course as shown in the above intel com link dual channel mode may be achieved with other configurations </s>
<s> dual channel module purchase preferences 1 purchase matched pairs tested to work together </s>
<s> 2 purchase exact same model numbers </s>
<s> 3 purchase exact same density frequency and timings </s>
<s> quot could i use 512mb ram with 256mb ram in dual channel mode sounds it could happen and if yes what kind of 256mb ram could i use in this situation </s>
<s> quot no </s>
<s> then memory must be in pairs </s>
<s> i will not explain further why this is so </s>
<s> there may be some that wish such a mismatched pair would work but that s all in the computer s design and not subject to our wishes </s>
<s> confirms you need pairs </s>
<s> get the second 8htf6464ay 53ed7 from crucial and you re done </s>
