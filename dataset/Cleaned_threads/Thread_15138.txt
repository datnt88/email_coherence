<s> hi can somebody help me please i have a toshiba px1265se 1g16 external hard drive it has onspec regen in stalled on what i think is a virtual drive the only problem is is that when i enter the password for the drive it says that the drive is enabled but when i go to my computer it is only showing up as a cd drive with only 19 7 mb </s>
<s> the drive itself is 200gb </s>
<s> i have loads of pictures and files on there which i do not want to loose </s>
<s> can anybody help </s>
<s> is there a way of removing the virtual cd drive thus allowing me access to my files </s>
<s> i am running windows 7 on a samsung nc10 </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> it s their software and if they fail then the next call is to gt all externals fail like this </s>
<s> these are not quot storage quot but temporary copies which we must backup </s>
<s> for those that don t backup because it costs too much just wait till they see the data recovery bills </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i appreciate the advice but i don t think it s a hardware issue i just think that either the mbr or virtual drive has become corrupt </s>
<s> i cannot delete anything as it will not give me access it says it s a network drive </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> matt </s>
<s> the problem is that this virtual drive is non standard </s>
<s> if you use some non standard feature then you need to ask toshiba how to recover </s>
<s> at the top of this forum are the usual titles to try but if you value your files i must stick to my original advice </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> managed to find a piece of software called cd to hdd converter </s>
<s> it converts to a hdd again but you will have to then use a file recovery software to get back your files because it formats quick you hdd </s>
<s> my bet is they get that call too often and may have a fix that does not create the need for file recovery </s>
<s> gt but this is the lesson that these drives are not storage </s>
<s> we must have a backup copy of what we can t lose </s>
