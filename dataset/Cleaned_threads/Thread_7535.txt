<s> i have a logitech mx700 that used to work in the past but now when i put it in the charger base station the light flashes red </s>
<s> it s supposed to be solid green </s>
<s> the mouse doesn t work </s>
<s> i have tried cleaning the gold contacts but so far that hasn t worked </s>
<s> usually means battery failure </s>
<s> what place has the best prices on batteries for a mouse like this </s>
<s> i also might try adjusting the metal coils inside the case so that there is a tighter fit with the batteries contacts </s>
<s> also i might clean the gold contacts with a little dab of vinegar on a cotton swab </s>
