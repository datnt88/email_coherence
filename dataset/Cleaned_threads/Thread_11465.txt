<s> i have a thompson wireless router which has been firmware upgraded </s>
<s> i can successfully access the internet with my intel imac and my pc laptop </s>
<s> when i try to connect to the router using airport on my gg powerbook 867mhz os x 10 5 8 i get a connection timeout message </s>
<s> i have successfully connected by airport wifi to my old router in london and even to a macdonalds free wifi </s>
<s> no luck here and isp unable to help despite sending me a new router and recommending the software upgrade </s>
<s> any assistance greatly welcome </s>
<s> isumbras </s>
<s> is sending out 802 11b and not just g and n this could be the problem </s>
<s> access the router see the manual and make sure that it is broadcasting on all three channels b g n p </s>
<s> many thanks for the tip i ll check straightaway </s>
<s> i </s>
<s> sadly not the root of the problem interface type </s>
<s> now that we have established that there is a next step </s>
<s> i assume that you are not spreading the wealth around the neighborhood by running a wireless network that does not have encryption </s>
<s> the next step is to turn off the encryption and see if you can now connect to the router with the powerbook </s>
<s> let us know p </s>
<s> ok i ll give it a go in the a m and come back to you </s>
<s> many thanks again i ve been working with macs since 1992 and do mac support myself but this one has me stumped </s>
<s> yes that works </s>
<s> can log into wifi from powerbook g4 when encryption is turned off </s>
<s> unfortunately have had to re enable encrytion as have a lot of data on other machines logged in to wifi </s>
<s> i guess we re a little closer to an answer though you are top man </s>
<s> maximum thanks for all the help </s>
<s> isumbras </s>
<s> i have found that my older machines will only work with wep </s>
<s> the newer stuff leaves them out in the cold p </s>
<s> ah could be it encryption type is wpa wpa2 </s>
<s> many more thanks </s>
<s> i ll get on to the isp </s>
<s> isumbras </s>
<s> it is up to you to set what type of encryption you use on that router </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> many many thanks for all your help </s>
<s> edited the security preference in the router gateway to wep and lo the powerbook now logs in fine </s>
<s> plusnet who only came up with the correct solution after i had fed the info on the basis of your information said i would have no problem logging on with my imac which was not the case </s>
<s> aren t they supposed to know this stuff </s>
<s> fortunately i managed to remedy the imac login and now wait to see if i can get my wife s pc spit to connect </s>
<s> heyho best wishes i </s>
<s> wep is no protection today </s>
<s> that is in less than 120 seconds with kid friendly software other folk can hijack your connection and use your internet connection as they wish </s>
<s> but in this discussion it looks like you are stuck with it </s>
<s> when you can and when the machines allow it move off wep asap </s>
<s> and let s be clear </s>
<s> mac address filtering does not work and hiding the ssid only results in more complaints and no added security </s>
<s> gt use what works but be aware of the downsides </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> many thanks for this info bob </s>
<s> hope this thread has been useful for some other people too </s>
<s> best wishes i </s>
