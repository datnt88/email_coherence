<s> i have to admit that i am to some extent accustomed to post here and chatter over trifles when i am free and spend a lot time with my gadgets </s>
<s> but there always comes some boring things such as the low power of ipads and phones </s>
<s> and sometimes i found the usb connectors on my pc is not enough to support my work as convenient as possible </s>
<s> so i searched on amazon and found a relatively suitable item maybe i can use to solve the trouble </s>
<s> but as i was used to buy peripherals from other sellers i have no information about this </s>
<s> could you guys tell me your experience on the products from this seller </s>
<s> does this item worth being consider as a perfect one or some better choice </s>
<s> here i see quot amazon prime quot so as the seller is amazon the prime part is that returns are easy </s>
<s> if it arrives and isn t what you wanted it s no trouble at all to send it back </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ve ordered dozens of things from amazon and never had a problem with them although i can t say how well this device will fit your needs </s>
<s> if you re looking for convenience you might find one of the car chargers more suitable </s>
<s> you plug them into the 12 v power outlet in your car then plug your devices into the car charger to charge </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> ok i guess i would look upon this way as a last choice </s>
<s> yeah i also give much credits on amazon s product quality </s>
<s> as you say quot car charger quot i do see it as a thing convenient for charge anytime </s>
<s> but i comparatively need some gadgets to charge at least two at the same time </s>
<s> so is there any kind of car charger with this function </s>
