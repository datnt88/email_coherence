<s> i m setting up my computer to use my living room screen and audio system for when i want to chill on the couch and watch web content and i m trying to figure out whether or not i can have both a wireless keyboard and mouse for chilling and my regular wired set for working hooked up at the same time </s>
<s> i d prefer not to have to use the wireless stuff all the time </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i picked up a logitech mx710 and it s fine </s>
<s> however range is iffy past 3 feet </s>
<s> find a bluetooth setup to get more distance </s>
<s> i have two wireless mice and one wireless keyboard both logitech </s>
<s> both mice work </s>
<s> i don t see why one being wired would make a difference </s>
