<s> my hp hard drive just went splat i m at the library now </s>
<s> the hard drive i have is an ide drive but the pc i am about to buy has an sata drive </s>
<s> i m told i can not put the ide drive in the new pc with the sata drive as my current pc wont even boot up how can i get the info on the ide hard drive off somehow on to the new pc with sata drive </s>
<s> please please help thanks </s>
<s> this can be done as the mb will have 2 ide channels </s>
<s> depending on how the new system is configured you should have one ide port open </s>
<s> attach the ide drive to the open ide port on boot access the bios primary boot device setting </s>
<s> make sure that the sata hdd is the primary boot drive </s>
<s> the issue may be xp not recognizing the drive and its data properly </s>
<s> you say the drive went splat meaning </s>
<s> bill </s>
<s> the pc shut down tried to reboot but seems to be stuck in a re boot loop </s>
<s> i was told by a computer savvy friend that the hd has sort of crashed or the operating system part of it anyway </s>
<s> so now it wont load up anything </s>
<s> it gets to the windows loading screen flicks then reboots again but very very slowly the does that same thing </s>
<s> it is a 4 year old hp which up until now no similar problems </s>
<s> if it ll boot in sm the problem is probably fixable </s>
<s> boot with a bootable floppy or cd and try using windows to access the drive </s>
<s> there may be a way to put the ide drive into your new computer with a connector card </s>
<s> take a look at compusa or best buy stores in your area for such devices </s>
<s> i have tried in safe mode but still does the same thing </s>
<s> i dont have a bootable disk is there a website or link where i can get it from on another computer then put this disk in mine try that </s>
<s> i tried asking at the store and they looked at me kind of funny said i could not put the ide drive in the pc with the sata drive then tried to see me a new sata drive </s>
<s> hp s have a recovery partition that gives you the option to re pair or re install windows </s>
<s> generally using the f10 or 12 key allows access </s>
<s> also some hp s have the recovery consul installed </s>
<s> on boot watch for boot optioin menu </s>
<s> if it is their select recovery consul via arrow keys and press enter </s>
<s> at prompt to select os 1 not the correct wording but you will understand when you see the prompt press enter </s>
<s> at the next prompt for admin password press enter </s>
<s> at the prompt type chkdsk p r </s>
<s> generally this fixes windows kernal files allowing system to boot to windows </s>
<s> and last using the f8 key to access the boot option menu select turn off auto re start press entry </s>
<s> this will stop the loop giving the bsod error message </s>
<s> luck bill last thoughts never end if you have a dial up account remove modem </s>
<s> i ve seen damaged modems create some wierd issues </s>
<s> i would like to know what windows operating system you are using </s>
<s> if it is windows xp then you can use your xp cd to boot up with </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> when i boot up i see the blue screen with the f1 f10 options but when i hit f10 it does nothing at all </s>
<s> i am using xp but it came pre insatalled i have no disk </s>
<s> hp and others will ship you cds for some small fee </s>
<s> much cheaper than buying another copy of xp </s>
<s> typical is 35 buck or less which beats the 199 buck retail price of xp </s>
