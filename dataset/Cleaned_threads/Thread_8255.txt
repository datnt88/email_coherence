<s> hi when it comes to buying external enclosure for extra hds should i be looking for something with cooling fan built in or should i buy something such as mad dog enclosure that claims aluminum housing for optimal heat dissipation etc etc </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> many thanks in advance guys </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> recommend searching thru and reading the posts here as your question and others like it have been asked and answered numerous times </s>
<s> you ll also see what to avoid </s>
<s> bottomline you can buy pre built prepackaged external hdds with 1 year warranty or select separates of your choice </s>
<s> the advantage to the latter is you choose the quality and characteristics of the components both the enclosure and the hard drive </s>
<s> the adaptec acs 100 is my choice as it handles hdds up to 1 000gbs has a one year warranty and is usb 2 0 the hdd i chose is a 320gb hard drive the wd3200sb has a 5 year warranty </s>
<s> i just installed the wd3200sb hdd in the adaptec acs 100 and it was as easy and uneventful as when i put a 160gb maxtor in another acs 100 </s>
<s> good luck on your search </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> thank you very much vapcmd </s>
<s> that adaptec looks totally awesome </s>
<s> so i am guessing cool fan isn t all that important as long as the unit has that heat dissipation feature correct </s>
<s> you re welcome the adaptec enclosures seem to dissipate heat well so while a fan might help they don t appear to be necessary </s>
<s> the key is the enclosure is well constructed it lets you see and use the entire drive capacity which many enclosure don t and it s comptable the systems you connect it to </s>
<s> the specs on many enclosures don t even address the maximum drive capacity in gbs </s>
<s> based on the posts i see here there seem to be an unusually high number of maxtor externals failing </s>
<s> can t tell from the posts whether it s the drives or the enclosures themselves failing </s>
<s> it certainly pays to handle them with care </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> the customer comments on amazon say that the enclosure does not work with win2k </s>
<s> has anybody experience this </s>
<s> do you know a fix </s>
<s> as i use such things with windows 2000 sp4 </s>
<s> i use win2k on my home pc and at work </s>
<s> i ve got 3 adaptec enclosures one acs 100 with a 200gb seagate the other with a 320gb western digital and an acs 120 with a 2 5 quot 100gb seagate </s>
<s> i ve had execellent results with the adaptec acs 100 as well as the acs 120 and they handle hard disk drives up to 1 000gbs </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i purchased an acs 100 and installed my hard drive </s>
<s> on my win2k sp4 machine i can turn on the hard drive and windows automatically detects external drive as a usb external storage device </s>
<s> when i try to stop the drive to do a safe disconnect unplug i select usb external storage device and click the stop button </s>
<s> then windows immediately restarts </s>
<s> i tried the drive with my new winxp machine </s>
<s> the drive is recognized my windows once i turn on the drive </s>
<s> when i go to safe disconnect unplug windows says the device is sitll in use </s>
<s> however i have closed every window and application that i know of </s>
<s> any ideas why i am getting this weirdness </s>
<s> any ideas where i can turn </s>
<s> i emailed adaptec customer support and they said that they do not provide tech support for that product only a hardware replacement </s>
<s> i do not think it is the hardware i think that i am having problems similiar to those list on amazon com i do not have another external drive to test if it is the drive or if it is a windows problem </s>
<s> please help i d appreciate any advice </s>
<s> i usually find an incomplete windows install </s>
<s> many relied on microsoft for drivers for the machine </s>
<s> but since not a word about the machine this discussion suffers an early end </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> do you think it is my machine </s>
<s> or an incomplete windows installation </s>
<s> both machines are dell computers </s>
<s> the win2k machine i reformatted the disk and installed win 2k </s>
<s> the winxp machine is new from dell dell did the install </s>
<s> i used the micrsoft drivers that windows suggested to pull down from the web </s>
<s> was that a mistake </s>
<s> i m happy to give more information if it helps i would just like to diagnose the problem but i am unable to myself </s>
<s> quot the win2k machine i reformatted the disk and installed win 2k </s>

<s> microsoft helps by getting the os on it s feet </s>
<s> we finish it off </s>
<s> given so little information about the non working machine i can t help yet </s>
<s> i wonder if it has usb 2 0 ports or if windows 2000 has all it s patches </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my windows 2000 machine had service pack 1 i upgraded to service pack 4 just before i hooked up my external hd </s>
<s> i downloaded the service pack from windows website </s>
<s> are there other patches that i need to install </s>
<s> is there an easy way to find the correct patch that i need </s>
<s> the machine came with 2 usb1 1 ports but i recently installed a usb2 0 pci card to take advantage of my new drive s usb2 0 connectivity </s>
<s> i will try hooking the external hd to a usb1 1 drive </s>
<s> as for the windows xp machine it only has usb2 0 ports </s>
<s> i did windows update a few days before i hooked up my external hd </s>
<s> however windows still says the device is in use or busy when i try to disconnect it </s>
<s> what information would help diagnose my problem </s>
<s> i thank you so much for your help and patience </s>
<s> it can show what programs access what files if any on the removable drive </s>
<s> it might help to have such info </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i noted that the windows 2000 machine you might share make model what type of usb ports and what drivers you installed after what microsoft provided </s>
<s> if the ports are only usb 1 1 try an usb 2 0 pci card </s>
<s> some drives do exactly what you noted on usb 1 1 ports </s>
<s> why not tell all </s>
