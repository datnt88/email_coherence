<s> like i said any feedback would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> let s say you hook up to your hdtv and receiver </s>
<s> did you know the sound card is unused </s>
<s> why get a sound card today </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you have a mid tower case </s>
<s> why use a micro mobo </s>
<s> that thing might give you a headache when you start fitting in parts </s>
<s> think clearance around stuff </s>
<s> shop for an atx mobo </s>
<s> hdd western digital caviar blue 1tb western digital caviar blue 500gb not sure if that means your going to get one or two but anyway do some reading about this style unit </s>
<s> i use mostly flac files for my music gaming off course much clearer on the ath m30 </s>
<s> the reciever will be hooked to the sound card </s>
<s> the reaon for a micro is that i will need only 1 gpu and 1 pci e and just 2 memory stics i don t think i need other features except those </s>
<s> and the 500 will be for the os the 2t for all the files </s>
<s> analog links and sound cards are pretty old ideas </s>
<s> hi bellusdeus i agree with bob about the motherboard size </s>
<s> in addition to his point about clearance i d say ventilation heat may become another issue in the long term </s>
<s> your cpu gpu will run hot especially when playing games </s>
<s> the more space for ventilation you have the better note the coolermaster hyper 212 evo will help cooling the cpu but it s large in size and won t do much for your gpu </s>
<s> plus when thinking of all the internal cables i e </s>
<s> sata power cables both the psu and gpu it will get tight in there the case you re buying has tons of room and it comes with 3 fans i suggest getting 2 more to ensure you get max ventilation </s>
<s> good luck sam </s>
<s> just buy an ssd or western digital caviar green hardisk it will boost your pc performance </s>
