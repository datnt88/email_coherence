<s> when i bought my canon bubblejet i560 the guy threw in a usb connector </s>
<s> after wasting an hour and one half i discarded it and loaded the drivers and other stuff from disc using the big bulky parallel </s>
<s> cable </s>
<s> it went flawlessly </s>
<s> is the usb cable really to connect printer and computer or for something else </s>
<s> many are unaware how to get their usb ports working </s>
<s> covers it well with bios enabling and drivers you install for the motherboard os and more that microsoft does not do for you </s>
<s> today s consumers didn t expect this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> never had any trouble configuring mouse keyboard or digital camera upload to usb port </s>
<s> can t understand why canon provides parallel and usb connections on back of printer and then it s impossible to set up the printer for usb using their supplied disc </s>
<s> even tried web page driver download with similar lack of success </s>
<s> now have spare usb cord </s>
<s> you may not have reviewed the web link i provided </s>
<s> many consumers are ill prepared for usb issues </s>
<s> there s not much more i can offer with what you have written </s>
<s> and you didn t exclaim quot omg quot with all the usb madness there is with all the chipset issues out there </s>
<s> just because a camera works means nothing </s>
<s> usbman sheds light on this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i just went to your usbman link bob </s>
<s> didn t mention it but my os is win me </s>
<s> long list of usb issues there according to usbman </s>
<s> i am also using winme and my new canon printer didnt even have any hookup except for the usb line </s>

<s> a repeating issue for windows owners is that usb doesn t mean it works </s>
<s> covers most reasons but here s the two i see a lot </s>
<s> first the usb ports must be enabled in the bios second many machines require motherboard or usb drivers that are not supplied by microsoft </s>
<s> a new annoyance is that microsoft offers a driver through windows update that is inferior to what the vendor maker offers </s>
<s> with what information you supplied only this generic advice can be offered </s>
<s> you have to research usbman because i don t duplicate web content in the forums </s>
