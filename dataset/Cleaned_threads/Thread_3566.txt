<s> i work on my computer usally 12 to 17 hours or more each day </s>
<s> currently i use a crt monitor that is about 3 years old </s>
<s> i really would like to update and get something nicer and newer but really not sure what is going to work the best and cause the least amount of strain </s>
<s> i plan to purchase my monitor when i build my computer with hp </s>
<s> so i was looking at the 19 inch vs19d i think that a 21 inch is a little more than i need </s>
<s> i like this particluar model because of the size and i also prefer having my speakers attached </s>
<s> is a flat panel monitor going to work good for me </s>
<s> i know i have heard in the past that they aren t good for extended use and such </s>
<s> is there something else i should be looking into </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> haven t you </s>
<s> because tft screens have a conintual glow from the backlight s they do not suffer from refresh flicker in the way crt s do </s>
<s> you can effectively use a terrible 60hz refresh rate on a flat tft and see no flicker at all where this is often noticeable on a crt especially if you view peripherally and easily is the biggest cause of eye strain </s>
<s> the problems for tft monitors is with response times </s>
<s> this is basically how quickly the pixels that make up the display can flicker through various stages and positions </s>
<s> if it s slow enough you see ghostly images as things move </s>
<s> if you buy a cheap old tech one with a very slow response time even scrolling up and down on a webpage blurs the lettering </s>
<s> this isn t easy on the eye at all and can be a headache to even find the mouse pointer on occasion </s>
<s> this has largely been addressed by tft s in the last couple of years as response times of 20ms and lower are now virtually standard excluding sony </s>
<s> the closest crt s have to this is a low screen refresh rate which you could always raise to fix but you can t do anything if you buy a slow response tft </s>
<s> that s it you re stuck with it </s>
<s> by far and away the biggest confusion for tft is something which is termed it s native resolution </s>
<s> because a tft screen is made up of a absolutely fixed number of indivdidual pixels wide and high this is the one resolution it works perfectly at </s>
<s> you can use other choices if you wish but things go a bit odd looking for obvious reasons </s>
<s> keeping numbers small multiply by 100 if you feel the need </s>
<s> imagine you bought a tft with 16 x 12 pixel display </s>
<s> you use a graphics card setting of 16 x 12 as each pixel provided by the card corresponds to a single pixel in the tft </s>
<s> this 16 x 12 is it s native resolution </s>
<s> if you change graphics resolution to 10 x 8 though well problems start to appear as the monitor now has to spread the 10 pixel width out over the 16 in the display and the same to the 8 high which don t divide equally into 12 so what the monitor does is some graphic pixels will be sent to singles on the monitor and some are sent to a couple of pixels it s trying to spread them out evenly which is impossible this leads to odd looking fonts especially </s>
<s> so the first thing you have to consider if you buy a tft is get one with a good fast response time that has no apparent blurring issues and buy a size that has the native resolution you intend to use </s>
<s> it s no good if you buy a 19 tft that has a native res of 1240 x 1024 if you plan to use an 800 x 600 res </s>
<s> the graphics diplay and the monitor s native resolution just aren t equally dividable </s>
<s> however one with a 1600x1200 native res can obviously deal with 800x600 just fine </s>
<s> each graphics pixel would be displayed on 4 pixels twice as high x twice as wide on the monitor </s>
<s> with that all said and done you can read more on sites like or lcd vs crt good luck geebee </s>
<s> the same question on a few of the forum areas and i ll waste my time answering the one here </s>
<s> i don t even know why i bother anymore </s>
<s> gb </s>
<s> i think you re right </s>
<s> i had my thinking backwards </s>
<s> but i swore i had heard that a few years ago </s>
<s> your answer was really helpful though probably a little too advanced for my good never the less everything i needed to know </s>
<s> sorry about the double post </s>
<s> i originally posted this last night and didn t get any responses so i was thinking i had put it in the wrong forum i ve done this before so i decided to repost </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
