<s> i have a machine with a radeon x1300 video card in it distributed by visiontek </s>
<s> it s been fine since i installed the card about a year ago but now there s something screwy going on </s>
<s> when using the computer the screen will at random go blank and display an quot out of range quot error </s>
<s> the computer continues to run e g </s>
<s> while watching video the audio will continue to play even though nothing is on screen </s>
<s> the computer has to be hard rebooted </s>
<s> it s happening quite frequently </s>
<s> several times a day and it s pretty much made the computer unusable </s>
<s> i did some searching and it s led me to believe that the video card is the issue since a few forums have said that when a monitor gives an out of range without warrant usually it means the monitor isn t getting a signal </s>
<s> i opened the computer up blasted some of the dust out and started it up </s>
<s> the fan keeps spinning when the monitor oors so it s not a cooling issue </s>
<s> i also tried swapping the monitor from port one to port two on the card and it seemed to have fixed the problem at first but no dice </s>
<s> it s still doing it </s>
<s> also note that the tv attached to the card s s videp out the tv mirrors the main monitor for watching dvds and streaming videos like hulu goes blank when the main monitor oors </s>
<s> any ideas on what s wrong </s>
<s> as i use this machine for watching dvds i d like to find a solution </s>
<s> netflix can be expensive if you re unable to watch and return discs </s>
<s> it did similar things like that </s>
<s> after a few too many instances i replaced the card and gifted that away </s>
<s> never did find a cure short of replacement </s>
<s> i took your advice and bought a new video card yesterday an nvidia this time and it s working now </s>
<s> i ll take a 100 video card over 1200 on a new computer any day </s>
<s> i felt a little bruised over that card </s>
<s> maybe it was buggy after all </s>
<s> the radeon card lasted about a year </s>
<s> i m not sure how long the rest of the computer will hold together it s about three years old and exhibits some odd idiosyncrasies occasionally though </s>
<s> i seem to have bad luck with electronic devices they always seem to fail too soon </s>
<s> my last desktop computer failed two years after getting it </s>
