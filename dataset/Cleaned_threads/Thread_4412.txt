<s> is there an esy way to share particular files and folders mainly music picures so all computers on my wireless network will have access </s>
<s> the main computer is running xp home the other two run xp pro </s>
<s> through your xp or other firewall then set the appropriate folder to be shared </s>
<s> all sharing group members need to be on the same workgroup </s>
<s> like the prev poster said make sure they are all on the same workgroup </s>
<s> to verify this right click on your my computer icon and select properties </s>
<s> click the computer name tab </s>
<s> then click the change button </s>
<s> now change the workgroup name to whatever you like this will need to be done on each pc </s>
<s> change it to any name you like just not the default </s>
<s> to enable file sharing find the folder you want to share on the network </s>
<s> right click on it and select sharing and security </s>
<s> there should be a button to enable file sharing </s>
<s> click the one that says just enable file sharing </s>
<s> then click the box that says share this file folder on the network </s>
<s> now you should be able to view all of the files folders by accessing the quot my network places quot icon in you start menu or control panel </s>
<s> let me know if this works </s>
