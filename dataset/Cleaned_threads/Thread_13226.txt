<s> download ad aware and scan for ad ware and do virus scans </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> or make netscape default </s>
<s> if either of these are what your going for just ask and as for turning of ie it s built into windows you can t quot turn it off quot but you should do spyware scans if your getting a lot of pop ups and ads </s>
<s> what you describe is exactly what can happen with messenger </s>
<s> out of the blue even with no browsers open you will get pop ups on your screen </s>
<s> go to my site below scroll down to the free software link and download one or both of two messenger utilities </s>
