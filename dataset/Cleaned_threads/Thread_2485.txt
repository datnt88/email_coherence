<s> my mother in law just bought an ao725 </s>
<s> she is totally lost on windows 8 i am attempting to install xp pro which is what she is familiar with </s>
<s> i have installed xp on many acer netbooks which came with windows 7 but i cant make any progress here </s>
<s> the setup program always stops with error 7b </s>
<s> i have tried using the ide mode for the hd bios setting and just about every amd sata driver i can find </s>
<s> neither of these methods seem to help </s>
<s> i have also tried xp pro sp1 sp2 and sp3 </s>
<s> i thought installing the 1 05 bios might help it came with 2 04 but it will not install </s>
<s> using quot free dos quot i can run the acer bios flash program zhg105 exe </s>
<s> initially the 1 05 update program would give a flash write error </s>
<s> i was able to reflash with the 2 04 bios successfully </s>
<s> this did not help with the xp install no change and after doing that the 1 05 flash program just resets instead of showing the write fail message at the same point </s>
<s> my next thought is to see if i can run a windows pe preinstall environment and use the acer windows flash update program zhg105w exe </s>
<s> currently i have ubuntu linux installed thinking i might be able to update the bios from ubuntu but i cant find any appropriate file </s>
<s> do you think i am on the right track with the bios </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated and no she is not going to be happy with windows 8 i cant get back to windows 8 anyhow thanks all les </s>
<s> a quick look does not show me that the bios supports that ide mode you need </s>
<s> this means not only must you find all the drivers but you ll need a floppy drive to perform the following </s>
<s> use google and type this in </s>
<s> gt xp f6 floppy sata install </s>
<s> i find most folk are not ready for such an install </s>
<s> gt if you go back to windows 8 why not add a start button so they are not as lost </s>
<s> they are free now </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have tried loading several different amd sata drivers using a floppy drive </s>
<s> i still get the 7b stop </s>
<s> i tried both the amd sb7xx raid driver and the amd sb8xx raid driver </s>
<s> any ideas which sata driver i should be trying </s>
<s> the laptop maker must tell you which one </s>
<s> i do not have this model to look further into </s>
<s> i forget something above </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> you will never get quot xp quot installed on such gear </s>
<s> those sata drivers require quot xp sp2 quot or later cds </s>
<s> if you have xp and i have to take your word above that s all you have then it s a dead end </s>
<s> don t waste your time </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have 3 cd s xp sp2 and sp3 </s>
<s> the sp2 and sp3 cds were created by slip streaming the service packs into the previous versions </s>
<s> acer of course says the xp is not supported but they have said the same thing about the intel atom netbooks i have converted </s>
<s> i just replaced vista on an hp laptop a few months back </s>
<s> i had to use the sp2 disc and the xp and sp3 discs would not install </s>
<s> i of course always try sp3 first as that way i don t need to install each service pack </s>
<s> there are base code issues with xp and xp sp1 </s>
<s> get the real xp sp2 or xp sp3 to avoid that issue </s>
<s> good try but after watching a tech waste days on that we know not to let them try it anymore </s>
<s> too costly </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if you regress from win8 you must be assured that any quot secure boot quot process has been disabled </s>
<s> newer pcs no matter what are becoming locked in due to bios eufi issue which in turn can use the secure boot mode </s>
<s> it may become an issue if you can t boot from anything other than the original hd etc </s>
<s> booting from other devices are defeated thus secured from malware attacks even though not being done </s>
<s> overall you need to verify the secure boot is disabled </s>
<s> win8 is becoming a pita to change from </s>
<s> not only that but also all the other issues of drivers can they be found for lesser oses </s>
<s> google for secure boot to find examples of the problem </s>
<s> this may not apply but worth looking into </s>
<s> when i visited acer there wasn t much to garner from </s>
<s> overall it lacked much imo </s>
<s> your best bet is to win7 as the os rather than xp </s>
<s> i don t see much support for xp in any form </s>
<s> plus as i already stated there may not be xp based drivers </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> that s a documented issue on some models </s>
<s> no mystery but rarely encountered </s>
<s> uefi efi thanks for adding that willy </s>
<s> thanks for this information </s>
<s> i just ordered a sp3 cd </s>
<s> les </s>
<s> thanks for the explanation of uefi </s>
<s> i had disabled that in the bios </s>
<s> i didn t know what it was but many other things could not be changed while uefi was enabled </s>
<s> i think there are a few mentioned by others such as classic8 start8 bob </s>
