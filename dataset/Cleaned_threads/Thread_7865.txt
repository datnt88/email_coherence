<s> hi all recently i installed an asus rt n66u router to serve a building that houses staff and some guests in all about 50 people in a given day </s>
<s> by all accounts it s one of the best routers money can buy but we ve still been having problems with it </s>
<s> i ve been experimenting with it for a while to try and nail down what could be the problem but nothing seems to help </s>
<s> the network is wpa2 protected and uses the same ssid and password as our company s other wifi networks in other buildings for convenience </s>
<s> some devices seem to connect just fine for others sometimes mobiles sometimes laptops when trying to connect users are told quot unable to connect to quot </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea what could be causing this </s>
<s> the router is running on the latest firmware and dhcp is enabled with a pool of 199 ip addresses </s>
<s> i thought it could be an issue with lease times but whether i put short or long leases the issue still occurs sporadically </s>
<s> any help on this would be massively appreciated because i m close to pulling out hair </s>
<s> we would never run any wap over a dozen connections </s>
<s> you gone over 10 tens that </s>
<s> nice idea if it works but it didn t so if you believe this router can do that many connections then you know who to call next </s>
<s> you also know that wifi interference is common but i see no mention of that in your post </s>
<s> there is a bug that seems to be in many router firmware versions and it s one i encounter a lot </s>
<s> i see no mention of where you tried the latest and a few prior versions </s>
<s> i ll be honest with you i would not expect that many connections to work reliably </s>
<s> there are many reasons since you have 50 odd computers and all it takes is one bad one to misbehave and knock others off the air </s>
<s> i mitigate that with more than one wap </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for your response </s>
<s> i should add some more information rookie error on my part </s>
<s> the router is apparently very capable and has highly rated load balance between the 2 4 and 5ghz bands hence why i got it </s>
<s> i updated the stock firmware to the most recent which is version 3 0 0 4 260 we have two netgear wn3000rp dual band range extenders at opposite ends of the building from the main router all of which run on separate channels 1 7 and 11 for 2 4ghz connections </s>
<s> currently the asus router handles all dhcp requests although the range extenders are capable of doing this as well </s>
<s> would you recommend that i offload some of the dhcp requests onto the extenders which serve a significantly smaller number of machines </s>
<s> if not i have some old linksys wag200g adsl routers that could probably be pressed into service although they re obviously only b g devices </s>
<s> quot all it takes is one bad one to misbehave and knock others off the air quot not sure what this means </s>
<s> if one machine misbehaves how would that affect the wireless network </s>
<s> unless that machine has access to configuration of that router then there is not much that machine can do </s>
<s> based on what you said there are a few possible reasons this isnt working but i don t think proffitt is going to help you here some of those answers are balogna wireless interference is not your problem </s>
<s> this router has been configured as somewhat of an access point to your building s network correct </s>
<s> it is always reccomended that dhcp should only be done centrally in one place as near to your nat device as possible </s>
<s> is your router now serving dhcp your entire network </s>
<s> having multiple dhcp servers is a horrible horrible idea don t offload dhcp to your extenders either </s>
<s> you want one single dhcp server no matter how large your subnet is </s>
<s> the best way to answer your question is for you to tell us a little bit more about your company s network </s>
<s> is this router now serving as a gateway </s>
<s> or is it simply routing packets internally which i doubt you mention your company has quot other wifi networks quot in other buildings but are these buildings connected to yours </s>
<s> like i mentioned earlier i doubt this is a physical issue interference overload but a logical issue </s>
<s> but first i will not intentional take a swipe at others that want to help you </s>
<s> i m only an embedded systems designer that wrote some router code in the 90 s so my view is from the inside out and recently an incident with netgear has me wondering about them </s>
<s> on to work </s>
<s> at the office we removed all range extenders as they created more trouble than they solved </s>
<s> we moved to waps or quot routers configured as a wap quot that did wonders for connection issues </s>
<s> however we did have to find a misbehaving machine in the lot </s>
<s> the neat part was that with only 15 or so connections per access point it was easy to figure out it was in that group </s>
<s> in your case i read all the machines connect to one access point and now extenders </s>
<s> you may have to think how to get some off loaded onto another access point to figure it out </s>
<s> and here s a lesson from the field </s>
<s> ban the 802 11b devices </s>
<s> your less seasoned networker may not know to do that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> can you explain how one bad machine will affect your entire network </s>
<s> youre answers do not seem to try and solve the user s problem but rather try to demonstrate your own technical competence explain why he should quot ban 802 11b devices quot please </s>
<s> your posts seem to want to engage me in some other topic about credentials and more </s>
<s> let s help this member now </s>
<s> the bad device pc was easy to find since only that wap was showing connection issues </s>
<s> we used the old binary search method to find it </s>
<s> as a seasoned tech you may know this one </s>
<s> you install a wap in the area and you put half of the users on one and the other on the new wap </s>
<s> if there is a troubled pc it will be in that wap that has troubles </s>
<s> so from 15 or less pcs we re down to 7 or 8 and we only have a few more moves to find the machine </s>
<s> then we can swap out that machine and see if we got it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> since the waps can t stay at full speed we lose a lot of possible bandwidth </s>
<s> if we did encounter a need for 802 11b it would be a simple matter to put a wap in for just that area for the 802 11b device </s>
<s> for the time that an 802 11b spends on air the 802 11g devices could have moved about 5 times as many bytes as the 802 11b device </s>
<s> i don t want to upset you but has anyone told you about this </s>
<s> bob </s>
