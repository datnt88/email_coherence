<s> i have a 800mhz ibook laptop and dont have a airport card is there any other products to connect it to my wireless network </s>
<s> i have heard of usb adapters but also heard they dont work </s>
<s> occurred to me was why not buy an airport card fro your ibook </s>
<s> the other thing that occurred to me was why is this person not telling us exactly what sort of ibook they have </s>
<s> is it an ibook with a 800mhz g3 processor or is it an ibook with an 800mhz g4 processor </s>
<s> both are airport ready and both can have an airport card easily inserted </s>
<s> it s a user upgrade for both these machines </s>
<s> note that the g3 machine requires the older 802 11b airport card which is more expensive and harder to find </s>
<s> the g4 machine requires an airport extreme card 802 11g which are cheaper and easy to find </s>
<s> both of these cards work </s>
<s> does that help you </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> it is a g4 800mhz i would just get an airport card but i was told only the older discontinued ones will work and people want 60 plus for an outdated card </s>
<s> doesnt make sense to spend 60 bux on a card that uses an old standard when i could go down to wal mart and have a selection of faster wireless adapters for around 40 dollars </s>
<s> of course those dont seem to work </s>
<s> the extreme will work with the g4 ibook </s>
<s> i am mistaken my ibook is not a g4 it is a g3 800mhz ibook </s>
<s> will the extreme card still work with this </s>
<s> you will need the older slightly more expensive airport card </s>
<s> if you found one for 60 get it </s>
<s> they got for anything up to 160 p </s>
<s> that is just crazy </s>
<s> i think i will find another solution thank you for your help </s>
<s> it s really not anyone s fault that you have an old machine that requires much sort after accessories </s>
<s> good luck on your hunt there are usb wireless devices out there that will work in your machine </s>
<s> problem is finding them </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> give macwirless com a try </s>
<s> they have 100 compatible wireless solutions for almost every mac </s>
<s> 60 is a good price on a used card </s>
<s> most people are selling them on ebay for 80 100 dollars </s>
<s> old macs are great but the laws of supply and demand will dictate the price of add ons and upgrades </s>
<s> some hotels offer wireless access points that plug into the ethernet port maybe they can be had somewhere or ask a hotel that uses them if they would sell a used one to you </s>
<s> good luck greg </s>
<s> here s a usb solution and some more info on that solution good luck greg </s>
<s> i am sympathetic believe me and it is admirable to be frugal as you clearly are </s>
<s> i have a g3 powerbook without an airport card myself and have given some thought to getting the right card for my little workhorse though it has unfortunately more pressing demands at present if i read things correctly beginning with a new battery </s>
<s> leaving frugality aside though you seem already to have some kind of network arrangement did i read you right </s>
<s> and the airport card would allow you to use hot spots all over so unless there is another much cheaper solution why not go for the card </s>
<s> for that 60 lucky you i ve seen the same cards offered only for more than 100 you d be getting a lot more utility and enjoyment out of your computer </s>
<s> my two cents and no disrespect </s>
