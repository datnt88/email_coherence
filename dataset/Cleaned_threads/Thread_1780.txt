<s> earlier tonight it was raining by my house so i turned off my pc after there was a short power outage </s>
<s> a few minutes ago my dad came over to use and turned it on and it wouldn t work </s>
<s> the boot screen showed up and it asked me if i wanted to start up the desktop normally or in safe mode </s>
<s> thinking nothing was wrong i chose normal and then to my surprise after the boot screen showed up the monitor went blank </s>
<s> i then tried turning it off by pressing the power button but it wouldn t so i had to unplug the power from the back </s>
<s> i started it over and started it in safe mode which worked </s>
<s> i m going to try reinstalling windows but before i do that i wanted advice from you guys </s>
<s> as for system info i ve got a gateway 504gr with winxp home edition with integrated gfx for those who think it might be my gfx card </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> all right guys i managed to quot fix quot it </s>
<s> while in safe mode i just restored it to a time before the storm 7pm </s>
<s> i still would like to know what might have caused my pc to act up like this though </s>
<s> somewhere and indicated by when the computer did work </s>
<s> a rule of thumb is if the computer works in quot safe mode quot and not in quot normal quot you have corrupted drivers or missing files </s>
<s> quot safe mode quot loads a minimum of these to get basic functionality going to help you return the system to working order </s>
<s> if quot normal quot mode fails when you ve had a power cut your pc has almost certainly lost a driver </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> well powering off whether by accident or otherwise isn t an instant usually an instant death to hardware </s>
<s> computers reset and operating systems crash all the time without worry so a power outage isn t any more dangerous </s>
<s> however an immediate power loss can corrupt a system file or driver </s>
<s> because these are loaded and in use they are sometimes in a continual state of flux and shutting down unduly springs a special surprise on them </s>
<s> they are then effectively corrupted as they weren t returned to a default ready status by a correct shut down sequence </s>
<s> this is a simplistic explanation and it doesn t happen but when it does safe mode s always the first route to recovery </s>
