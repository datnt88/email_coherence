<s> if you want gaming go amd obviously </s>
<s> get a 3200 or higher depending on your budget </s>
<s> for a gpu get the nvidia 6800 or ati x800xl </s>
<s> get at least a gig of ram </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> considering the difference between the 3000 and 3200 is minimal while the price difference is fairly big considering the performance difference also avoid radeon x series as they lack sm3 0 support and will give you issues with sm3 0 games such as anything based on atari s upcoming u3 engine which is starting to surface and some modern games such as the latest installment of splinter cell it however allows for backwards compatability as it was released around the same time as dx9 0c which req </s>
<s> s sm3 0 only geforce 6 and 7 truly support sm3 0 ati can t even come close geforce 6 and 7 also support fp32 or higher ati lacks this aswell don t quote me on this but i believe geforce 7 supports fp64 in addition the psu with your case probably came as part of a 20 90 package i d suggest throwing it away now to save the hastle if your building a pc to last for any ammount of time your going to want to buy a psu of a high caliber and no psu included with any case with the exception of double redundant psu s which cost upwards of 700 for some is going to be of a high caliber there are some exceptions but very very few those would include a few upper level antec models and 1 or 2 thermaltake models </s>
<s> it s socket t not socket 775 it s not even a socket actually it s an lga land grid array it s inverse a normal cpu has pins on it s bottom which plug into the motherboard lga 775 is the inverse the cpu has 775 pads on it and the board has 775 pins that connect to the cpu never installed one seen one up close in person i ve used lga 775 equipped machines but i hear it s not the easiest thing in the world to do socket 939 would be adviseable however </s>
<s> just a suggestion you can buy an emachine t6520 on best buy for about 600 with all the hardware you need except the video card but it includes a pci express slot for upgrades </s>

<s> thermaltake cl p0075 to cool it down and 1 gig of corsair xms twinx1024 3200c2pt memory </s>
