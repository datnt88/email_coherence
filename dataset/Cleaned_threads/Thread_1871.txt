<s> on my laptop there are two air vents in the back </s>
<s> when i play videogames both vents blow hot air out and work perfectly </s>
<s> however when i am simply browsing the internet or not even on my comp only the left fan runs and it is very loud </s>
<s> the right side which fan isnt running is noticeably hotter </s>
<s> what could be wrong with my comp </s>
<s> this has been going on for about two months and it really worries me because the laptop is only 1 year old </s>
<s> it could sound as if this was by some design </s>
<s> of course you ve already done the usual canned air cleaning right </s>
<s> if you ve done no configuration for fan operation then its doing what most laptops do operate on an as need basis </s>
<s> they get turned on when it gets hotter for whatever setting or sensor activation </s>
<s> since you mentioned a 1yr </s>
<s> use maybe its time to do at least the basic quot cleaning cycle quot of the laptop </s>
<s> once done and it acts the same then its done what its setting were at </s>
<s> you should also review any fan operational setting are at either at the bios level or a pgm </s>
<s> designed for your model laptop </s>
<s> you may need to check your manual in this case </s>
<s> as always it helps to provide the laptop details here to better answer your </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> you don t like this model </s>
<s> try another </s>
<s> i clean out my fans quite often so i dont think it is a cleaning issue </s>
<s> the main thing that bugs me though is that it seems that the laptop is using the one fan too an extreme when its not necessary </s>
<s> what happens is i leave my laptop for 10 minutes when i comeback the one fan is roaring while the other does nothing but if i dont leave my laptop and am constantly browsing the web or typing neither fan is really blowing </s>
<s> once the fan starts going it goes on and off until i shut down or restart my computer </s>
<s> my bios is up to date </s>
<s> my laptop is an alienware m17x r3 with i7quad core and radeon 6990 hd graphics card </s>
<s> replace the fan and use the laptop cooling pad for it </s>
