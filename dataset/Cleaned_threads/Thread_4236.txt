<s> i have just bought a ricoh africo ap4510 </s>
<s> it will not print </s>
<s> it is online </s>
<s> the cables are correctly plugged in </s>
<s> the power supply is on </s>
<s> i send a page to print and nothing happens and it comes up printer error </s>
<s> even a test page will not print from my computer </s>
<s> i have connected it through the lpt1 port </s>
<s> does anyone know what i am doing wrong </s>
<s> do i need to clear out some registers or other stuff on my computer </s>
<s> the computer tells me the lpt1 port is working and ok please help i ve spent hours on this </s>
<s> since dos can send to lpt1 i boot to dos and tap the prtscr print screen key about 3 or 4 times to see if the printer is alive </s>

<s> hi thanks for your help </s>
<s> it is still not printing </s>
<s> i have checked the cable and changed it </s>
<s> the printer will print a test page from its own menu so i know the printer is working </s>
<s> i do not own this printer but a cousin of this model needed a menu item turned on to allow the printer port to work </s>
<s> is where the manuals are </s>
<s> i haven t read it yet but leave that to you </s>
<s> good luck and try the network connection next </s>
