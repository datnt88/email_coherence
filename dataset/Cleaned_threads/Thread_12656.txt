<s> the case i aquired has a lcd panel to indicate temperature labeled cpu hdd vga </s>
<s> how are these best positioned </s>
<s> cpu at the base side of the heat sink </s>
<s> hdd on the drive itself or near the controller ic </s>
<s> vga controller ic </s>
<s> i am hoping someone has experience with these devices and can advise what is considered optimum use </s>
<s> thanks rbul </s>
<s> virtually all mobos have a thermistor located in the cpu socket that is probably the best place to sense cpu temp </s>
<s> your bios probably reads it and you can download speed fan to read it in real time </s>
<s> google it </s>
<s> for your sensor maybe have the sensor about 1 inch above the hub of the cpu fan </s>
<s> both amd and intel recco the temp there to be under 38c for their heat sinks </s>
<s> this gives a high but in spec cpu temp thus adjust your air flow fans to get that well below that temp </s>
<s> if i had such an item mine only has one sensor </s>
<s> i would simply move them around every now and then and get a temp profile of the interior temps in the case </s>
<s> if you go to a new hotter en hades video card you certainly want to be sure that the air is moving through that section </s>
<s> vga should be considered to be the video cards ati or nvidia chip on the card if you have a card </s>
<s> once you establish the steady state temps at the various locations they won t change unless you change the airflow situation </s>
<s> of course they will also move up and down with your room ambient temp </s>
<s> thank you ray </s>
<s> just the 3 probes all connected to the lcd front panel </s>
<s> what products are used to afix heat sensors to pcb s hdd s cpu s </s>
<s> tape gum adhesive what s available </s>
