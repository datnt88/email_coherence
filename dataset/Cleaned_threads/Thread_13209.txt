<s> the title says everything </s>
<s> i have an nvidia asus gtx 460 graphics card that was working fine before </s>
<s> whenever i pop the cd in that came with it the drivers won t install and when i download them from the nvidia webpage i try to install them and it says quot unable to detect graphics card quot everything s plugged in considering i didn t unplug any cables through the reformat session </s>
