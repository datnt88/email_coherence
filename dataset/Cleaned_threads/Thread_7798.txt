<s> ok i have 3 computers all running xp home </s>
<s> i networked them and the only thing that is shared should be the shared documents folder which i can see </s>
<s> one of the computers has the printer shared to the laptop when i go to print and i am not sure why since i did not share it </s>
<s> is it because there are multiple users for that computer ex mom dad kids </s>
<s> quot one of the computers has the printer shared to the laptop when i go to print and i am not sure why since i did not share it quot see if you can explain this sentence a little clearer </s>
<s> do you mean that you can print from the other computers even though you hav not shared the printer </s>
<s> yes that is what i mean sorry for the confusion </s>
<s> when i set up the desktop fresh install of xp home i didn t share anything but the shared documents folder so i am confused how the printer can be shared </s>
<s> the printer is a device your files will not be shared </s>
<s> i realize the printer is a device but my question is why is it showing on another computer if i didn t share it </s>
<s> first a word from microsoft about the quot network neighborhood quot or nn for short </s>
<s> quot note if a computer is removed from the network before the computer is logged off the network it may take up to 45 minutes for that computer to be removed from the browse list quot this annoys many in that the nn is not realtime </s>
<s> even if you had shared this printer for just a split second it could have been picked up by another machine </s>
<s> further documents show that the nn may hold such for days or weeks </s>
<s> don t let it bother you too much </s>
