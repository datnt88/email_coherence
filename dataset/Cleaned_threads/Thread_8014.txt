<s> i have 2 computers both win xp a network laser printer and a broadband internet connection all hooked up to a linksys befsr41 router </s>
<s> i had the 2 computers networked to each other but now i lost the connection between them and can t get them to find each other </s>
<s> however each computer can access the internet through the router </s>
<s> how come they can t find each other </s>
<s> i have run the necessary xp programs and rebooted </s>
<s> what could be the problem </s>
<s> quot i had the 2 computers networked to each other but now i lost the connection between them and can t get them to find each other quot since it last worked </s>

<s> viral or spyware infestation </s>
<s> have you checked the workgroup names </s>
<s> done a search for computer from each computer </s>
<s> tried to ping each others address </s>
<s> i worked on this problem for hours until i decided to do a system restore to an earlier point </s>
<s> that re set whatever was wrong so i was able to connect again however different problems arose with my internet connection </s>
<s> but now it seems to be working ok so i ll go forward from this point </s>
<s> i just wish i knew what was wrong so i could have fixed it myself </s>
