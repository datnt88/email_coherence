<s> does anyone know if anyone makes gps chips cards that work off a pcie expansion slot in a pc or laptop </s>
<s> many are other connections such as usb serial and bluetooth </s>
<s> these are fungible items today so why would i want to push the costs up by going pcie </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have found through dint of hard experience that anything that sticks out of the computer can be broken the port may be damaged or both i want to keep the outside as neat as possible also </s>
<s> get it internal or use the usual bluetooth unit </s>
<s> i can only guess you know why you can t replace the internal radio wifi bluetooth gps cellular cards yourself </s>
<s> do you remember why </s>
<s> i don t want to upset you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have one in my laptop now but i can t find anything telling me who made the chip every laptop maker except general dynamics told me they don t install them i can do the install myself if i can just get names so i can go to their website and check out what they have by the by the general dynamics laptops w the gps imbedded run 2000 or more </s>
<s> but it appears you are not aware why these can run from cheap to not cheap or why you usual can t retrofit unless you void the maker s warranty </s>
<s> there are only a few gps chip makers so that can t be your real question </s>
<s> i m fine if you just come out and ask but writing a tutorial about product testing passing fcc certifications and more must be limited to one short paragraph </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hunh </s>
<s> what i m asking is if there are gps chips available that can be added to directly to the mobo or inderectly by way of a pcie slot so i don t risk damaging it when it bounces around in a moving vehicle what does that have to do w fcc certs or anything else in your reply </s>
<s> if you can help answer my question great i drive for a living and having the chip in my computer makes planning my route trip a lot easier so does finding the actual address of the customer at either end </s>
<s> you ll want to use a bluetooth gps unit for this </s>
<s> i didn t reveal all but i am on a team that developed some gps feature for a product i won t reveal </s>
<s> as to what the fcc has to do with this is everything in this country </s>
<s> you pass or you can t sell it </s>
<s> your question is one that would happen from folk that didn t know that </s>
<s> i must keep all that testing and such stuff short so i ll stop again on that here </s>
<s> so no there is no chip for this </s>
<s> if there was you would have found it </s>
<s> but i have used those bluetooth gps units for setups that involve laptops </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> all that said now i know why thanks now my next question is there a particular usb bt unit that you would recommend for what i m doing i m thinking perhaps wrongly of a unit that looks similar to at bt unifier like the one that comes w a bt mouse or will i have to get a unit that attaches to the vehicle somewhere then uses the bt to trasmit to the unifier in the port </s>
<s> but your everyday bluetooth in a laptop can talk to mouse keyboard headset and a bt gps without any big issues </s>
<s> so if someone wants to call that a unifier let s let them </s>
<s> bt gps units are what we call fungible </s>
<s> when i need one i go to amazon com and get another one </s>
<s> we can get some militarized units for many thousand bucks but sales didn t happen so we just use the ones you find at amazon </s>
<s> plentiful all seem to work fine so i don t supply exact models </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry blonde moment i thought you were talking about the bt plugging into the usb the units from amazon ebay etc will be a unit that mounts to the outside of the vehicle and then talks to the computer using the built in bt chip and doesn t have the mini device type screen correct </s>
<s> we rarely use an outside the cab solution as that would have the installer drill holes and more </s>
<s> the simple bluetooth gps units we used are on amazon com and sit somewhere inside the cab and get power from almost anywhere </s>
<s> the power draw is very low </s>
<s> are you writing you use your laptop outside the cab area </s>
<s> isn t that a bit hard to drive in winter </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no the laptop is docked between the seats i was thinking the gps unit was attached to the roof with a magnet or something i ve talked to the folks that make the one program that i use and they say that any unit will work w their software so i f i get an updated version of delorme to replace my older version then i ll be ok thanks for all the help and information have a good weekend </s>
<s> it s a standard that is found on all units so far </s>
<s> my old delorme works fine with such devices </s>
<s> gt yes there are some magnet mount and cable solutions but we deal with transit and have to install them a little more permanently but without incurring a lot of install time </s>
