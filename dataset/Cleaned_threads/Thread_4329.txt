<s> it s for a new desktop and the phone line with dsl coming out of it is pretty far around the house lots of walls in the middle </s>
<s> if i was going to run a cable i d need 200 ft of cable i think very rough estimate </s>
<s> i know that the general creed is that a hardwire is always stronger than wifi but at that kind of distance would the latency in transferring signal over that much wiring justify wifi to just save the time </s>
<s> i d get pretty good reception i already have wifi running for an xbox360 in that room </s>
<s> but a homeplug mains borne networking adapters solution is a strong contender for your proposed setup </s>
<s> hardwired wins out over wireless where latency is concerned even with great reception especially for the xbox360 </s>
<s> max distance for cat 5 cable is 100m so you still have 100ft or so to play with on top of the 200ft you are planning </s>
<s> if you aren t concerned with latency than wireless is by far the easier solution </s>
