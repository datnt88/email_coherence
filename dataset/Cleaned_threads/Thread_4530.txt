<s> for my vista pc </s>
<s> at the moment i have the sound blaster live 24 installed on my xp machine it works great </s>
<s> it comes with a suite of audio software that all works but not so on my vista machine </s>
<s> it installs but not properly and few of the features are available to use </s>
<s> i think it s a vista driver issue but their website offers no relief </s>
<s> i m peed off and would like to say goodbye to creative and hello to some other replacement </s>
<s> thanks for any suggestions </s>
<s> vista itself is riddled with bugs so you should expect the hardware drivers for vista to be even buggier than the os itself creative are the largest mainstream sound chip manufacturers for pc s </s>
<s> if the creative drivers dont get along with vista dont expect vista to play nicely with anyone else </s>
<s> yet another poor sucker that fell victim to microsoft marketing </s>
<s> my advice switch back to xp for 12 months until vista becomes a little less microsofty </s>
<s> thanks i kinda expected to hear that </s>
<s> i recently d loaded a new driver for vista 32 from the guru of 3d site </s>
<s> it does allow a few of the progs to work but not all </s>
<s> particularly the one i wanted most the player recorder </s>
<s> it has the record quot what u hear quot setting and is pretty useful it does show but with no recording abilities </s>
<s> i have it installed on my xp machine and it runs well </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> except creative </s>
<s> vista eliminated the hardware abstraction layer that most all sound cards depended on so you wind up with only the generic sound support built into vista </s>
<s> you ll need to get an audigy x fi if you want all of the bells and whistles you were accustomed to in xp </s>
<s> creative is releasing better drivers for older cards like the audigy and live series but their mostly for game support and won t give you the full feature set </s>
<s> vista has uncovered how lazy immobile creative and many other vendors are </s>
<s> and such as ms s bad press these days that it becomes their fault </s>
<s> as the second reply to your post points out the audio subsystem received a major overhaul mostly for the better in vista yet the vast majority of the vendors still don t support it properly </s>
<s> it is a major job to be sure but they ve known about the changes for ages </s>
<s> suffice it to say that older soundcards won t be supported with vista from virtually anyone and expect only whatever was available just before vista launch to be supported </s>
<s> you should be pretty safe with x fi cards as far as driver support in vista is concerned </s>
<s> it s not complete now but they should have it sorted out in a while </s>
