<s> i have a western digital 80gb drive that i was using as an external drive </s>
<s> i took the drive off for a bit and i believe i even placed some of my friends files on there so that i can back up his drive </s>
<s> weelll now that i have placed the drive back into the casing to make it a external hard drive again nothing picks up i made sure all the jumpers where in place correctly and nothing </s>
<s> when placing the drive into my pc as a slave this is what i see wdc wd84vfb 04cea6 17 47w17 and then my machine will not boot up </s>
<s> i take the drive off and i am able to get into my computer </s>
<s> i have alot of pics on that drive including of my late mother that just recently passed away and some of my exfiance yeah i know shes my ex but i still like too see her pics and i have other personal pics on there </s>
<s> is there anything that can be done </s>
<s> please let me know </s>
<s> wd drives are jumpered differently than most other mfr s drives </s>
<s> ive actually tried every jumper trial by error and the jumper has been on a slave for months now never changed it </s>
<s> this is killing me lol </s>
<s> that is how wd drives get set as master with no other drive on the cable </s>
<s> however i m not sure of whether the usb case actually uses the jumpering </s>
<s> for master only wd puts the jumper horizontally only for the purposes of providing a jumper for future use </s>
<s> be fine so don t do anything radical </s>
<s> possibly using it at both locations changed or corrupted something re the mbr or such </s>
<s> worse comes to worse get a knoppix cd and put the drive into a computer as master the only drive in the computer at the time and see if the knppix cd gives access to the data </s>
<s> robert proffitt a moderator here and a few others are experts on use of the knoppix cd </s>
<s> i have two and have never even tried one </s>
<s> actually yeah and with the external casing the drive has to be placed with a jumper dont know why but its been on as a slave for about a year or a year and half now </s>
<s> ive never had a problem until now with the drive maybe the ide board on the hd went </s>
