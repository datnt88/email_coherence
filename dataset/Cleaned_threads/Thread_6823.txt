<s> bob </s>
<s> the error explains upon getting the error open cover and remove the right inkcart then close cover and open again </s>
<s> if the light remains lit non blinking ink cart you removed is the a problem </s>
<s> if the led continues to blink then the remaining ink cart still mounted is the problem one buy a replacement for the one that it refers to </s>
<s> review your error again does it make sense now </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
