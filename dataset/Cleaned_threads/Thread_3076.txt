<s> the tablet maker would issue it </s>
<s> this is not like quot windows quot hope the short answer suffices </s>
<s> yes there are other folk hacking it onto some tablets but then no support that i can find </s>

<s> my concerns is quot icecream and jellybean are mostly for omap upgrade these tegra 2 tablets to android 4 xx probably if not definitely not a good option quot i wonder if asus and motorola would issue an effective upgrade versions since the tegra 2 tablets are being faded out </s>
<s> it s quite a strange statement </s>
<s> remember i ve been programming the pre historic tablets pre android so i find your statement something i would never write </s>

<s> but let s get this up on the table </s>
<s> the tablet makers do not see recurring revenue by issuing updates </s>
<s> in fact i ve encountered bugs in systems and years later the bug is still there </s>
<s> let s take the gloves off and not sugar coat this issue </s>
<s> you can not expect the tablet makers to issue updates </s>
<s> apple will be the exception but you see that ipad 1 may have had it s last update </s>
