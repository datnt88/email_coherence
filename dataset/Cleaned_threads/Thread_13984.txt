<s> hello i am new to this forum and building computers </s>
<s> i just finished my first build and there is no picture the fans just whirr and the motherboard led lights </s>
<s> here are my specs mobo asus m5a78l mx cpu amd athlon ii x3 3 3ghz case cit recon matx case ram kingston valueram 2gb ddr3 1333mhz hdd wd1200jb 120gb 7 2k rpm this is rescued from an old dell dimension pc and fitted with an ide to sata adapter </s>
<s> everything apart from the hdd is new </s>
<s> i am using the integrated ati radeon 3000 they can be returned within 14 days as they are from amazon co uk and ebuyer </s>
<s> i have tried removing the sata for hdd </s>
<s> same problem </s>
<s> i removed the ram and hdd </s>
<s> same problem </s>
<s> i reformatted the hdd in the old dell </s>
<s> if i get the build working it should display the no os detected bios message like it did in the dell </s>
<s> i will try any other suggestions </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> remove all drives or disconnect entirely </s>
<s> now boot and if no display then something remains either faulty or badly configured </s>
<s> test the monitor on another pc does it work </s>
<s> you can try the reset the bios to defaults bu using the quot clearing pins quot thus review the manual for what it takes to do this </s>
<s> if the monitor still doesn t display then the mtrbd </s>
<s> is somehow bad or some incompatibility exists </s>
<s> be 100 sure no shorts or contacts on the mtrbd </s>
<s> are present on its backside check </s>
<s> alas be 100 sure that the cpu is supported if the manual states it is maybe you need a bios update to fully support to the level it needs in order to do so </s>
<s> it all this takes too long return the mtrbd </s>
<s> for replacement or try yet a different one </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> one thing to first check is that the monitor is plugged in on the mobo </s>
<s> the monitor should be on first displaying the no signal fault then turn on the pc </s>
<s> if the no sig goes away but remains blank the video bios is not starting </s>
<s> a rest needs to be initiated </s>
<s> if still no dispaly pull all the parts from the case and assemble them onan anti static surface and connect it up just like in the case </s>
<s> if things start working you ve got a grounded stand off mounting point </s>
<s> i like to use plastic or nylon standoffs unless specified to be grounded in the user manual </s>
<s> sometimes this leads to intermittent shorts as the mobo gets warm and grows a little </s>
<s> i have tried all that and tried it with an identical working motherboard but no luck </s>
<s> the cpu is supported and i don t think a bios update is required but how do i update that anyway without it booting </s>
<s> it was a bizarre case where a new cpu would only function if the bios was up to date </s>
<s> i had to install an older cpu update the bios then it was ready for the new cpu </s>
<s> lucky for me i had a computer shop for this </s>
<s> most folk will have to return products in such condition </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> try to replace or upgrade your power supply smps by a reputed brand </s>
<s> you did not mention the brand and spec of your smps </s>
