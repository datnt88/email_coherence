<s> hi i want to upgrade my p s but i want to know if its going to be compatible with my mobo </s>
<s> right now i have one of 200 watts and i d like to get one of at least 400 watts or maybe more </s>
<s> what should i know before doing such step and what brands are reliable </s>
<s> operating system windows xp compaq presario s3100nx amd athlon xp2200 1 8 ghz pga462 socket a total expansion slots 3 pci 1 agp 4x 1 5v hope this info can be enough and thanks for any help </s>
<s> well good brands would be ocz antec enermax and some thermaltake units </s>
<s> take a look at newegg com </s>
<s> everyone should replace the psus in oem pcs </s>
<s> imo it will be quieter more stable create less heat and make ur pc happy </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> i was surprised that it came with a lite on psu </s>
<s> really junk though </s>
<s> but even more surprising is it comes with dual 12v rails </s>
<s> but still the psu is crappy with very low 12v rail voltages </s>
<s> but its 400watt and has dual 12v rails pretty good </s>
<s> this is the compaq sa4000t roger </s>
<s> a 450 psu should be more than adequate </s>
<s> i am over here in the uk and h w is more expensive </s>
<s> i bought a new pc case which inclused a 450w psu and found it was a better idea as the price of both was little more that the stand individual psu i would have bought regards john </s>
