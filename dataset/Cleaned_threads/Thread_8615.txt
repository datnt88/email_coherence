<s> just noticed something that has been happening lately </s>
<s> first off in my 1st rig using a gigabyte nvidia 670 4gb version 2nd rig using nvidia 560ti </s>
<s> in all games i primarily use 1st rig for gaming i m getting a screen tear like a horizontal line one third of the way down my monitor </s>
<s> it s not actually tearing it seems the upper third of the screen is slightly behind being drawn than the rest of the screen </s>
<s> i enable vsync in all my games not point having the card pump out 200 frames </s>
<s> strnagely when i turn off vsync the tearing goes away but obviously my gpu gets hotter and fans speed up </s>
<s> i don t get it vsync is supposed to eliminate tearing not cause it </s>
<s> advice please </s>
<s> that the vsync in the nvidia control panel can be ignored of overridden by game settings </s>
<s> and with games having bugs you re never sure that setting it to on will cure it </s>
<s> so start with the nvidia controls then for each game look around for more settings in the game </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> vsync is set to quot use 3d application settings quot in nvidia s control panel </s>
<s> change it retest and if broke make it a warranty issue </s>
<s> forcing triple buffering in the control panel seems to have stopped it for 1 game anyway </s>
<s> need to try others </s>
