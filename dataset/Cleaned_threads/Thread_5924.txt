<s> troughout the past week my computer kept freezing every once in a while when playing world of warcraft </s>
<s> i would have to restart my computer after the picture froze </s>
<s> just today i was playing when suddenly the computer just turned off </s>
<s> i went to turn it on again and it will not power up </s>
<s> no lights no fans nothing </s>
<s> i figured maybe the power supply was dead which would have explained the strange freezes i was getting throughout the week </s>
<s> i switched power supplies with an older computer and found the same results </s>
<s> the power supply that i thought was dead was working fine on the older computer and my newer computer still had nothing </s>
<s> i tried switching the graphics cards with the same results the graphics card works fine on the other computer </s>
<s> i don t think its the memory because the computer isnt even starting up </s>
<s> seems like its a power problem yet the power supply appears to be working fine on other computers </s>
<s> could my motherboard have died out on me </s>
<s> i m using an asus p5b e motherboard and have had it for 6 months before these problems started </s>
<s> cpu is a core 2 duo 2 4ghz </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas on how i should go about troubleshooting this </s>
<s> any help would be great </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> have you checked to see if the cpu fan is working could be that the cpu over heated and shut down the same could also be true of the memory </s>
<s> chris </s>
<s> don t discount the ram in spite of what you said the same happened to my computer just stopped working would not power up etc after trying everything including numerous e mails and help from hp i eventually removed one of the ram modules and hey presto it worked </s>
