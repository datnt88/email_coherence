<s> my sister got a used apple 1705 monitor but no cable </s>
<s> upon checking it does have a db15 connection on the back </s>
<s> the original cable googled says it would work provided you use the quot adapter quot that came with it for pcs </s>
<s> no cable and no adapter </s>
<s> now investigating further suggests it will work with a db15 male to db15 male cable to a vga card </s>
<s> but it seems there maybe a scanning issue </s>
<s> if this is the case will it work at all using a std </s>
<s> vga pc cable from monitor to video card </s>
<s> no need getting a cable if it won t sync as googling provides but others says it will work </s>
<s> i want to believe a newer pc type video card will be able to sync but hate to waste for a new monitor cable </s>
<s> i just wonder if anyone has gone through this </s>
<s> otherwise it be recycled via the goodwill </s>
<s> yeah they do recycle not resell </s>
<s> tia willy </s>
<s> as you have noticed the connector on the 1705 is not a standard vga connector so the vga to vga idea will not work </s>
<s> that connector is actually a da 15 but is often referred to as db 15 </s>
<s> the apple monitor cable is wider than vga and will need an adapter to bring it down in size </s>
<s> there is an adapter see it here that will work for you but you will need to buy an apple monitor cable to connect the monitor to the cable </s>
<s> hope this helps p </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> i already seen the adapter side of things </s>
<s> basically they offer use with an apple cable since i have no cable its another expense </s>
<s> the costs are getting to be heavy and thus won t go that route </s>
<s> i can buy a working pc monitor for the costs of all the cable s adapters again thanks willy </s>
