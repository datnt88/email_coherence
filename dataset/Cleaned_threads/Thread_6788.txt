<s> i cannot get my ati all in wonder 9800 agp to post when combined with the asus a8n deluxe mb </s>
<s> the ati board works on an older asus mb and the mb works with a pci video board </s>
<s> after much conversation with the ati people i am concerned that the agp slot in the mb is defective </s>
<s> has anyone gotten this combination to work </s>
<s> the ati people won t comment on this and the asus people will not reply </s>
<s> thanks david </s>
<s> the ati all in wonder 9800 agp works on an agp port and cannot on a pci video board </s>
<s> the asus a8n deluxe board has pci express slots and ordinary pci slots none of which works with the card </s>
<s> suggest get a new card </s>
<s> the 9800 is comparable to an x600 which costs 200 </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> no sir the a8n deluxe i have does have a agp slot </s>
<s> note that asus makes at least 3 boards that start with a8n </s>
<s> now can you answer the question </s>
<s> thanks david </s>
<s> david unfortunately you have run into a problem that ati refuses to deal with or admit to </s>
<s> there is an energy spike that occurs with this card during bootup that causes many newer mobo s to auto shut down </s>
<s> i went thru the whole bit with an abit as8 v board and finally had to buy a different video card to fix the problem </s>
<s> there is nothing wrong with your mobo </s>
<s> the only fix i have heard which isn t really a very good one is to disconnect the secondary power cable to the video card for about 2 seconds at the start of booting up and then plug it in </s>
<s> what a pain every time you start your system </s>
<s> until ati deals with the problem your 9800 aiw is going to be useless </s>
<s> my best advice is to get a new tv tuner an hd one and avoid ati </s>
<s> it sucks that i paid almost 400 for my aiw when it was newly released and like you i rebuilt my new system around the darned thing instead of a newer pci e system and core 2 duo cpus which my as8 v can t support </s>
