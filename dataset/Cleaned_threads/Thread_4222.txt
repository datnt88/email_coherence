<s> hello everybody i m planning to buy an imac g5 in a couple of months and i ve been reading some feedback on the product from other users </s>
<s> i like the elegant desing of the imac g5 but i m worried about a possible fried system because of the tiny all in one integrated design </s>
<s> that concern comes to mind after reading some users said that the system has not lasted more than 30 days before frying </s>
<s> my concern is greater since i don t live in the u s and a refund or system change is more difficult overseas and the investment is too much to take such a risk </s>
<s> i read that consumers should not buy first generation apple products because they always fail </s>
<s> is this true </s>
<s> should i wait a little more </s>
<s> i haven t heard from apple explaining possible issues about the heating factor on the new imac g5 </s>
<s> many users have complain that it has a noisy fan and its performance is not like the one advertised by apple in the first place </s>
<s> i like the space saving design and upgrading capabilities of the imac g5 and i would like to buy one </s>
<s> what do you guys recomend me about the possible heating and fry factor </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> hi i can see you concern about the difficulties of returns and system changes </s>
<s> however i think that apple has the required infrastructure in place for all the places that it sells equipment to </s>
<s> you have not said where in the world you live so i cannot be more specific </s>
<s> first generation machines are always a little suspect but the imac g5 is no longer a first generation machine </s>
<s> it has been updated at least twice </s>
<s> i know of 8 imac g5 owners and none of them have had any problem with their machines </s>
<s> do some more reading and remember you only hear about the fried few and never about the working thousands </s>
<s> good luck p </s>
<s> hello one of my co workers purchased a new imac g5 over six months ago and loves it </s>
<s> no problems ever </s>
<s> i think that apple did their job on this one </s>
<s> yet he leaves his toaster oven on repeatedly </s>
<s> he will probably burn his house down some day </s>
<s> he does not use his imac for frying eggs in the morning either </s>
<s> seriously on the other hand another co worker bought one of the brand new imac g4s before and has had a lot of problems with it for over a year </s>
<s> but not overheating </s>
<s> mostly software issues </s>
<s> where in the world did you hear the feedback that the imac g5 overheated and fried </s>
<s> i would like to know please </s>
<s> need facts and documentation </s>
<s> if it is true than i think that it could become the next george forman fry o lator </s>
<s> foodnetwork com could be selling them next </s>
<s> i think that i am getting hungry with all this frying stuff </s>
<s> is it also good for toasting crumpets also </s>
<s> thought that i would keep the discussion light </s>
<s> kevin </s>
<s> hi yes my concern about the returns and refunds is a bit higher than purchasing an imac living in the u s i live in central america </s>
<s> we do not have apple stores over here only distributors </s>
<s> their sells and systems have guarantee of course but i will not be purchasing one to them cuz is a lot money to spend </s>
<s> i want to buy my imac g5 directly from the apple website </s>
<s> it s good to know that the imac g5 has been updated at least twice and according to your buddies none of them has had any problems with the overheating factor </s>
<s> that will be my first mac since i wanna change from mac to windows because i m tired of all the updating thing and spyware viruses os inestability etc </s>
<s> regarding of the feedback i read yes there were some people who had troubles with their mac s cuz of the overheating factor </s>
<s> of course i will do more reading but i wanted some opinion of this community </s>
<s> thank you for your help </s>
<s> i had a lot of fun reading your post </s>
<s> well the feedback i read was from cnet s users opinion on the new imac g5 </s>
<s> i want to make something clear too </s>
<s> out of the 450 something opinions about the product maybe only 10 or 15 were bad </s>
<s> but it happens that almost all the bad opinions were noisy fan related and that makes you wonder if there could be a problem with an overheating system in the future since the desing is up to such a thing to happen </s>
<s> and about the frying thing yes there was some user that affirmed that his system fried due to overheating </s>
<s> but my concern about all of this is that it happens that i can be a person that can face the same situation and since i live in central america my invesment adquires a higher risk </s>
<s> i hope you guys can understand my concern </s>
<s> i m not saying exactly that this will happen to me nor do i want you guys to think that i m overreacting </s>
<s> i just wanna be sure before i make the decision </s>
<s> i will catch up my reading also </s>
<s> have a nice weekend </s>
<s> there was a problem with a brand new g4 tower that had a bad cooling system and a really noisy fan a year ago at work </s>
<s> kind of sounded like an air conditioner starting up wwwwwrrrrrrwwwwhhheeerrrr </s>
<s> lousy sound effects </s>
<s> our company sent it back to apple and the new g4 replacement was quiet as a church mouse </s>
<s> bad fan if you are worried about getting fried by apple don t worry </s>
<s> apple will replace it </s>
<s> guaranteed and they do not want any of their apples fried </s>
<s> baked maybe with some brown sugar </s>
<s> i do not think that it would cost you anything to have it returned and sent back for a new imac g5 if it ever came to that being fried </s>
<s> what are the latest cnet reviews on the imac g5 </s>
<s> as a suggestion go to about com and read the reviews on the imac g5 </s>
<s> about com has a ton of info also </s>
<s> one other site would be daniweb com a forum site </s>
<s> nice </s>
<s> ask a question and get the answer </s>
<s> free to join apple stands behind all of its products </s>
<s> guaranteed </s>
<s> if you ever had a problem with an apple product and had to do a replacement you would probably receive your replacement in the same time as i would living here in new england </s>
<s> check out the apple website and distribution </s>
<s> where do you live in central america </s>
<s> thanks for your post kevin </s>
<s> well about the cnet s reviews i just did a search on home page imac g5 and i clicked on the quot all users opinions quot button </s>
<s> thank you for giving info about these sites that can also provide me with feedback on the imac </s>
<s> i live in el salvador </s>
<s> users opinions are sometimes helpful </s>
<s> try those other sites out also </s>
<s> good luck </s>
