<s> santa brought a new dvd drive for christmas </s>
<s> he got a oem from newegg </s>
<s> all that came was the drive and that was all </s>
<s> santa s helper me installed it </s>
<s> it must need drivers because it will not play a dvd movie </s>
<s> the drive is a nec dvd_rw nd 3550a </s>
<s> i went on google to look for nec but didn t find what i was looking for </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> titles like powerdvd windvd are common </s>
<s> having just the drive is not enough </s>
<s> also drivers don t fix this issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> when i put the dvd in auto run starts and a window opens and wants to know what program i want to use </s>
<s> i chose windows media player </s>
<s> another window opens and says windows media player cannot play the dvd because a compatible dvd decoder is not installed on your computer </s>
<s> there are two buttons under that one is close and the other is web help </s>
<s> web help takes me to a site to buy a plug in </s>
<s> is that what i need or is there something else </s>
<s> you can find them for sale on the web but i found it cheaper to get a drive with said player software </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you can either go directly to the cyberlink website to see what kind of deals they offer or just buy from the link you got directed to by windows </s>
<s> there are free alternative s but the codecs those freebie s install sometimes play havoc with other media and playback software </s>
<s> the cyberlink plugin for windows media player will give you the powerdvd 4 codec i believe and your dvd s will play fine in windows media player on windows xp </s>
<s> this doesn t work on 98se or me since wmp doesn t play dvd s on those os s </s>
<s> you just miss some of the fancy audio and video tricks like multichannel audio and video enhancement </s>
<s> you get the decoder that downmixes the dvd s audio to 2 channel stereo and the video codec that will enable dvd playback through windows media player 9 and 10 </s>
<s> i m having same problem </s>
<s> this problem only happens to new release dvds </s>
<s> i have powerdvd and windvd and have 3 domputers with 3 different dvd drives </s>
<s> however results are same </s>
<s> i was trying to watch transporter 2 which just came on blockbuster last week but it won t play on a computer but my reg </s>
<s> dvd player plays it </s>
<s> i think it s new copyright stuff or something </s>
<s> sucks </s>
<s> if not then what i noted does not apply and you should start your own discussion </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> go to and download the free frunhofer dvd codecs 230782 on lefthand collum and this will allow you to play dvd s in wmp </s>
<s> this works for windows me and xp </s>
<s> i ve done it and it works </s>
