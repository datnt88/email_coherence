<s> when i try to play music on my laptop it s very slow to load play </s>
<s> the hd space within my laptop is pretty much full now so i m thinking that s my problem </s>
<s> if i were to get myself an external hd with tons more space loaded my music music playback software on that it should all run normally right </s>
<s> i just wanna be sure 1st before i plunk down </s>
<s> it all depends on what is taking the space on the primary hard drive </s>
<s> if music files are the culprit then that should solve the problem but when an internal hd gets to that situation we often find that other steps are needed for example reducing system files like system restore backup files if windows uninstalling un needed software etc </s>
<s> so really it is difficult to say whether what you suggest will work or not </s>
<s> one thing though where are your backups </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> i suspect it s the music files only because i did notice a gradual slow down with the more music added </s>
<s> i ve backed up the music on dvds </s>
<s> and good to see </s>
<s> slow playback of music tracks doesn t necessarily relate to a full hard drive so i wonder if there is anything else amiss </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> it could very well be the other things you mentioned </s>
<s> i ll have a look </s>
<s> thanks </s>
