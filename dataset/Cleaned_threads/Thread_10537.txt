<s> how this company managed to stay in business since 1996 is beyond me </s>
<s> i ordered a pc from ibuypower on june 16th 2006 since i received it i ve had nothing but problems </s>
<s> what really ticks me off is that i paid extra for one of those lcd temperature display devices and all they did was screw it in the bay slot and plug it into the power supply but did not install the sensor wires where there supposed to go so therefore it was telling me the pcu hard drive and system temp were all 20 degrees celcius </s>
<s> i called and asked about it and they tried to tell me it s only supposed to monitor the case </s>
<s> that s when i decided to unscrew it from the bay slot and saw for myself right behind the lcd plate that all the sensor wires were still all tied and bundled together untouched </s>
<s> they also did not include any manuals other than my motherboard manuel so i couldn t even do it myself til i found the online manual after searching forever </s>
<s> i ordered a cold cathode tube blue neon light that comes with 2 in the kit and they only put in 1 and they kept the other one and my case only lit up from the bottom and it was all dark from the middle to the top of the inside of the case </s>
<s> the 1st pci express slot wasn t reading my 7950 gx2 video card on a p5n32 sli deluxe motherboard because they failed to update the bios and they shipped it without the video card able to work with drivers so i had to send it back to them only because the 2nd pci express slot worked but not the 1st so i thought it was defective and not the bios liek they said it was but i still dont believe them when they said it was the bios </s>
<s> i had to ship it back to them and i when i got it back the video card worked but then the pc kept shutting down every so often for no reason it was liek i unplugged it from the wall when i didn t </s>
<s> lets see what else their customer service is really bad </s>
<s> probably the worst customer service i have ever had </s>
<s> they were rude they didn t build my pc as if it was their own </s>
<s> it was done halfa and they pocketed about 8 900 of my money as their own profit for building it </s>
<s> i know this because i just sent it back and i m building a similar pc with all the same parts coming from newegg and the total is about 900 less </s>
<s> these guys do not deserve 900 of my money when they do not even hook up the sensor wires to my processor for the temperature device </s>
<s> i ve called them literally 27 times in a timeframe of 4 weeks about problems and normal </s>
<s> s about the pc since i had no manuals i had no choice but to bug em about things </s>
<s> i talked to a couple nice techs but overall my confidence in my ibuypower pc was never 100 </s>
<s> i never felt certain after calling them about problems and they always try to hurry up the call it always feels liek their tempted to hang up on you if you ask another question </s>
<s> oh yea almost forgot i called and asked if they received my pc yet when i had to send it back and they told me it would take a half hour to look up the tracking number then he was like huuuuh sighing like hang on he came back 4 min later to tell me the status of tracking from fed ex </s>
<s> now i just sent my pc back to them yesterday for a refund and they are charging me shipping </s>
<s> they snuck in an extra 49 for rush shipping when they had me believe the 85 charge for shipping was it but it was 85 another 49 for rush shipping when they had me believe the 85 included rush delivery or else i wouldnt have asked for rush service </s>
<s> and now another 43 to send it back that s 177 in shipping fees all for nothing they could at least have paid my 43 ground shipping for when i returned it yesterday on 7 17 2006 i also noticed if you goto and read their customer testimonials you can t even add a new review yurself on their site they disabled it hmm i wonder why but if you read a lot of their customer testimonials yull simply be able to tell their own employees submitted all those positive reviews </s>
<s> i m so upset 177 down the drain for shipping fees and i m stuck with nothing til i finally get my refund which will be far less than what i actually paid for </s>
<s> once i get that refund i m ordering my saved cart from newegg god knows how long they will take to refund it </s>
<s> they absolutely do not care about their customers </s>
<s> these guys are prolly shipping out 50 pc s a day pocketing an average of 600 per pc for their own profit and simply do not deserve it </s>
<s> if i had money to start my own company i d build all my customers pc s as if it were my own </s>
<s> i deserve a pc company more than these guys do </s>
<s> i am furious as now the date is 7 18 06 32 days later and i m out 177 with no pc </s>
<s> nvidia recommends them on their site which is what got my attention nvidia should remove their link if they want to save their reputation </s>
<s> guys there s even more things that were wrong but this review has gone long enough and i need to goto work p hope this helped i really truly hope my comment makes an strong impact on you crazy pc lovers out there when it comes to purchasing a new pc </s>
<s> stay away from ibuypower ibuypoop </s>
<s> here is my email to them customer 68168 invoice 161390 hello and good day after further discussion with my business partner guru promtions llc i m afraid we have decided to not do any further business with your company </s>
<s> we both recieved our pc s in completely laughable condition </s>
<s> cracked pieces hard drives not installed disc drives dont open lcd doesnt display motherboard sounds like a freaking jack hammer windows crashing during boot up believe it or not the list goes on </s>
<s> what exactly takes place in quot quality control quot </s>
<s> dealing with your company has been a nightmare </s>
<s> so we are going to have to take you up on your 30 day money back gaurantee as stated below </s>
<s> my pc is already being shipped back to you with the rma all over the box </s>
<s> i still have the discs here but i will ship that back as well and will gladly cover the cost of discs </s>
<s> we basically just want this nightmare over with and expect the money to be credited asap </s>
<s> my partner will send his customer number and invoice number shortly </s>
<s> we both ordered with the same company credit card </s>
<s> and before you answer me back with questions like did you contact cust service </s>
<s> or what about technical support </s>
<s> the answer is yes on multiple occasions </s>
<s> quot ibuypower provides a 30 day money back guarantee not includes shipping handling and rush service fees and the following limited warranty </s>
<s> this limited warranty extends only to the original purchaser quot so guess what thier reply was </s>
<s> pls contat customer service </s>
<s> this is good info </s>
<s> i m in the market for a new system and ibuypower is one i looked at </s>
<s> good prices but not if they sell garbage </s>
<s> cyberpowerpc com has a very similar interface and look </s>
<s> are they the same company or is this just the way several online computer companies look </s>
<s> also does anyone know what s the deal with quot professional wiring quot costing extra </s>
<s> if you don t pay do they let their preschooler wire your box </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> anyone can do what they did it was all done half ass the professional wiring from ibuypoop was nothing fancy and im still waiting for my god dam refund i ve missed out on pretty much the entire summer without a pc all because of ibuypower </s>
<s> what do they tell you about your refund </s>
<s> does anyone know if velocity micro the company is a good company to deal with </s>
<s> do they stand behind their computer products if problems develop </s>
<s> big steve biloxi mississippi 07 21 06 </s>
<s> they just said they ll give the refund which is 177 less than what i paid since shipping fees totaled up to that amount and they didn t have to if they just built the computer the way it s supposed to be built </s>
<s> now i the customer have to pay extra for their mistakes </s>
<s> they just received it today according to the fed ex tracking site but i don t expect to see a credit on my credit card til i ve completely waited myself to death </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i ve never done business with velocity micro so i dunno </s>
<s> velocity micro is a nice company but the customer support can be good or average depending on the problems you may experience </s>
<s> be warned some of there systems are starting to show up in best buy </s>
<s> other good companies or at least ones with good ratings include pugent and vigor </s>
<s> pugent really deals with regular or advanced mods for systems </s>
<s> they also have comments on different system configs </s>
<s> whatever you decide company wise make sure you get acronis backup software </s>
<s> what kind of back up software </s>
<s> please explain </s>
<s> big steve biloxi mississippi 07 22 06 </s>
<s> acronis true image lets you back up partitions on another drive or on cd and dvd </s>
<s> so basically you could restore the pc before any problems occured </s>
<s> i recently attempted to buy a computer from ibuypower and ran into issue after issue during the purchase process </s>
<s> i say quot attempted quot because i decided to cancel this order given the amount of trouble they had caused me before i was even technically their customer </s>
<s> first it only took a few days for the money to be withdrawn from my account they had no problems taking my money only a problem with giving me what i paid for but it took a week for someone to contact me and tell me that there was a problem with my order </s>
<s> pauline khuu from the sales department contacted me and told me that my shipping address was not verified and they could not ship my computer until i quot added my shipping address to my bank account quot </s>
<s> she stated that they verify the shipping address to quot prevent fraud quot however i fail to see how waiting until after they collect the payment to verify the shipping address prevents fraud </s>
<s> it only protects them from fraud while causing problems for the customer </s>
<s> wouldn t common sense tell you to verify the addresses before taking a payment if you truly cared about your customers </s>
<s> regardless i called my bank and they had no idea what i was talking about when i asked to add my shipping address to the account and they told me that the shipping address that i had given ibuypower was the correct address that they had on file for me and that they had no record of anyone calling to verify this address </s>
<s> i asked pauline if they were calling the right bank and discovered that they were not so i gave her the correct phone number for my bank </s>
<s> she called me back an hour later pauline quot the bank will not verify any of your information for us unless you are on the line quot me quot great so get them on the line quot pauline quot we don t have three way calling </s>
<s> do you have three way calling that we can use quot not exactly what i would expect from a reputable company but i would have complied if i had the capability </s>
<s> unfortunately i did not so i asked what other options we had </s>
<s> the only other option was to fax or e mail a copy of my photo id credit card and a quot credit authorization form quot to them which sounds a bit fishy to me since they already have my payment </s>
<s> why do they need a form authorizing credit when they have already had the funds for a week </s>
<s> and since i am an american working in baghdad i don t have access to a scanner or fax maching anyway so this option was impossible i told her that i should cancel my order then since there is no quick way to resolve this issue and i would only have a small window in september where i would be in the states and able to take delivery of the computer and this shipping address issue meant they hadn t even begun assembling my computer </s>
<s> she told me that it would be 5 7 business days before the funds would be put back into my account so at this point i got very angry since they had deided to hold onto almost 2 000 of my money for two weeks and gave me absolutely nothing in return </s>
<s> to which pauline got very defensive and started telling me about how this whole situation was actualy my fault and insinuated that i hadn t read the fine print on the website which i did </s>
<s> i fail to see how any of this is my fault but regardless i don t know of any company that would go blaming their customers for a foul up even if it is the customer s fault </s>
<s> that s just not good business </s>
<s> then pauline engaged in a full blown argument with me and began yelling about how this wasn t the first time she had tried to contact me and that she had actually tried to contact me several times the previous week which was a bold faced lie the phone i gave them was to my skype phone and other than my wife they are the only ones who knew of that number so unless she and my wife shared the same name this was the first time she had ever tried to call me </s>
<s> pauline said that she will quot do her best quot to get me my money back quot as quickly as possible quot which i m sure is code for quot whenever i get around to it quot this was yesterday the 28th it s currently the 29th and my order is still listed on the website as quot processing quot never buy from this company </s>
<s> you will encounter that issue again </s>
<s> i ran into this long ago with other companies </s>
<s> nothing new here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had nothing but problems with my system from them right from the start and i still do even after getting it quot fixed quot by them 4 times now i will have to spend more money on top the 1800 i spend on the pc form them and the return shipping charges you have to pay i will never buy form them again that s for sure </s>
