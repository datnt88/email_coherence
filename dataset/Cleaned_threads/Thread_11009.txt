<s> i have a great mobo on the way but what cpu should i get </s>
<s> is an overclocked e8500 better than the q6600 </s>
<s> any cpu speed rating that s not oc ed is stable once oc ed you re pushing it </s>
<s> if you re buying a cpu to oc then you assume all risk </s>
<s> multiple core cpus tend to work well and they needn t be speed demons even if they can be oc ed </s>
<s> as for your buy what you feel suits you </s>
<s> i exclude oc needs </s>
<s> i suggest any cpu you get should be easily supported by your mtrbd </s>
<s> as for the mtrbd if oc ing in mind that it is also oc friendly </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> is to run it at stock settings for stability </s>
<s> those that overclock do so at their own risk and choice </s>
<s> for me i d get the one that is faster natively and fits my budget </s>
