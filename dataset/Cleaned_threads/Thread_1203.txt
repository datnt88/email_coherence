<s> which routers currently have good content filtering </s>
<s> i am looking at possibly replacing my netgear 7230 since it seems to quot choke quot after too much use </s>
<s> i like the quot content filtering quot subscription the router allows since i can keep my family from stumbling on certain sites </s>
<s> i did purchase another router that claimed it supported content filtering but that required entry of each site </s>
<s> i am definitely not doing that </s>
<s> do any other consumer grade routers support this </s>
<s> i have used a sonicwall soho for a several years but their annual fee for content filtering was much too high for my usage </s>
<s> brad </s>
<s> see if the wrt54g with the upgrade addresses this </s>
<s> as to the choke if i see a router do that i update the firmware and make sure it s not buried under a pile of trash heat kills </s>
<s> if that doesn t do it it goes back </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the cfs subscription is more expensive on a soho unit because the soho is postioned more as a business class appliance businesses are more apt to spend higher dollars than consumers </s>
<s> consider purchasing a sonicwall tz150 </s>
<s> you should be able to purchase the firewall and the cfs for about the same cost as the soho for the first year </s>
<s> the follow on years should run you about 120 per year </s>
<s> let me know if you need additional details </s>
<s> 120 per year is still 3x to 4x what i want to pay </s>
<s> i don t love my netgear but it works for about 30 per year for cfs </s>
<s> does the tz150 limit the number of users </s>
<s> that was a real annoyance with my soho unit </s>
<s> brad </s>
<s> when i check for a firmware update i am told it is quot up to date quot </s>
<s> the unit is also outside the warranty period </s>
<s> i did purchase a netgear wpnt834 rangemax 4 port switch 240 mbps mimo 802 11g b wireless router since i found it for around 75 which may have been an error </s>
<s> i will see if that works any better though having a spare is not a bad idea either </s>
<s> brad </s>
<s> take a look at the zyxel zywall 2 i ve had one for 2 years and have been very happy with it </s>
<s> the content filtering subscription can be purchased for about 65 per year </s>
