<s> a very petite lady friend of mine 4 10 quot is studying to be a medical transcriptionist but is finding that conventional keyboards require her fingers to stray from the home position a lot </s>
<s> this prevents her getting up to speed and might well lead to repetitive stress injuries down the road i m told </s>
<s> is there a keyboard available that isn t a toy that is made for smaller than average persons </s>
<s> it would need to be pretty much a standard keyboard but with reduced key size and or spacing number pad optional </s>
<s> i m presently looking at the 83 key low profile mini keyboard sold by ergonomic resources but i don t know who actually makes it </s>
<s> can someone give us advice </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> there are many chinese manufacturers out there </s>
<s> just asking if this is required to buy the keyboard </s>
<s> i use a few 83 key mini keyboards for servers and at booths to save space </s>
<s> after picking up one i found more for 20 bucks at game sellers </s>
<s> it s the one they sell for the ps2 that connects with usb </s>
<s> while they don t tell you it works with a pc it does and at under 20 bucks not a big investment </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m not a gamer so i ve never heard of this </s>
<s> is it a brand name model </s>
<s> chinese characters aren t required here just plain old european </s>
<s> is this sort of thing available at circuit city compusa and the like </s>
<s> thanks terry </s>
<s> you asked for the maker and that s what s on one here </s>
<s> the keyboard has english key tops </s>
<s> the unit may have been boxed as a ps2 usb keyboard which had some other name such as kingmax on it </s>
<s> all this confuses the issues here since it s a generic product with many suppliers and in many packages </s>
<s> let me ask if the maker is a needed piece of information to purchase such a keyboard </s>
<s> i picked these up at ebgames best buy but don t venture to circuit city so i can t answer that </s>
