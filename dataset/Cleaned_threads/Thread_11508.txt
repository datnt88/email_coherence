<s> i m looking to get a new wireless router because i m upgrading my internet speed it s going to be at 12mbps and want to take advantage of it </s>
<s> so far i ve looked at a limited number of them and the main one that has caught my attention is the netgear wireless n router wnr2000 </s>
<s> i don t want to spend much more than 100 but i want to make sure i get one that will allow me to seemlessly do everything i want use internet watch movies through netflix with good quality hd movie streaming gaming etc </s>
<s> would this netgear one be good enough to handle that </s>
<s> or does anyone have any other suggestions that they know would handle all this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> mine is setup exactly like this forum s sticky tells us </s>
<s> latest firmware default settings then wpa </s>
<s> it has run for months without a reboot except for those pesky power outages </s>
<s> downstairs the router is on the top story as basements are a bad idea a simple lenovo y530 with hdmi can play hulu via hdmi to the hdtv </s>
<s> and this with the wifi set to 802 11g mode only </s>
<s> so is that your hd answer </s>
<s> what else </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> even wireless g is rated more than 4x what you ll get over the internet </s>
<s> n is only going to potentially improve lan speed where a wired connection isn t practical </s>
<s> i have a netgear wndr3700 wireless router that i really like </s>
<s> i had read great things about it and it has lived up to it s billing </s>
<s> i ve had it since about november of last year and have not needed to touch it since </s>
<s> totally reliable very fast and the mixed wireless g and n approach that they have is great </s>
<s> in fact my daughter is living here with us while she finds her own place after graduating from college and getting a job and she has her new desktop computer in her bedroom </s>
<s> i just happen to have a netgear wnda3100 usb adapter lying around and am using it on her desktop wireless n 2 4ghz </s>
<s> and it is just like a hard wired connection for her </s>
<s> my other daughter has a laptop that uses wireless g and they can both use wireless at the same time with no problem </s>
<s> i also had some visitors the other day and finally set up the guest network for them in about 2 minutes and they used that an ipad and a mac laptop </s>
<s> oh yeah the wireless is excellent throughout my house even where i had problems with my old linksys wrt54gs i ve got nothing bad to say about the netgear wndr3700 it has been excellent for me i had tried a couple of other wireless n routers which had not worked as well the linksys wrt310n just didn t work right and dlink dir 655 was fine but not nearly as fast as the netgear and was a single band router as well </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> they re all good but i prefer the d link routers for several reasons that include their performance their user interfaces their ease of setup their versatility their rock solid reliability and most importantly their absolutely spectacular customer support </s>
<s> i personally use a d link dir 655 which reaches every corner of my rather large three story home with excellent throughput </s>
<s> as with most routers nowadays when wired it serves as a gigabyte switch </s>
<s> i got mine very soon after their introduction over three years ago now and it has never suffered as much as a hiccup requiring a reboot </s>
<s> but understand that any router even old 80211 g routers please get an 80211 n it really makes an enormous difference can swallow a 12mbps network connection or much faster than that without a hitch </s>
<s> your router will not be the choke point effecting internet performance </s>
<s> please note that my preference for d link in my own home and my recommendation of them to others is what a lawyer would call a quot statement against interest quot in that i own stock in cisco manufacturer of linksys home routers </s>
<s> i am sorry but i would never buy another netgear </s>
<s> i have had problems with mine and the tech support i had with them was horrid </s>
<s> i almost just forgot about accepting the new one and bought a different brand after hours of trouble shotting of which they finally decided was defective </s>
<s> it was such a terrible experience i wouldn t recommend them to anyone </s>
<s> i actually had laryngitis when i called and the tech insulted me and all senior citizens thinking i was old and incapable </s>
<s> my son also has similar problems with his and has to unplug the router and wireless and plug back in on a very frequent basis </s>
<s> my experiences was just the opposite of yours </s>
<s> i went though 3 linksys wireless n routers in two weeks and had to reset them every couple days to keep them working </s>
<s> took those back and picked up the netgear wndr3700 router hooked it up and never looked back </s>
<s> best router i have owned </s>
<s> there are lemons in about everything you buy now you just have to be lucky and not get one of them and be forced to call their tech support </s>
<s> an inexpensive alternative would be the netgear wgr614 </s>
<s> it s a wired wireless router b g but it cost only 29 99 at my local shack </s>
<s> i had mine up and running w 3 laptops and two desktops within 2 hrs </s>
<s> ok so i took the long route and maybe did some browsing to test the connection and there hasn t been a hiccup yet </s>
<s> netgear stuff is fairly solid imho and i couldn t beat the price </s>
<s> example at sorry i can t suggest that model </s>
