<s> a friend of mine has been checking out my hp compaq and he says that my hard drive is fried </s>
<s> he took my hard drive out and exchanged it for another which worked fine </s>
<s> now it looks like i either need a new computer or a new hard drive </s>
<s> i don t really want a new computer i love this one </s>
<s> but my friend says that if i get a new hard drive i will have to replace my os with another windows xp </s>
<s> is this true </s>
<s> why can t i use my replacement disc s on a new hard drive </s>
<s> you can replace a hard drive and install your original copy of windows xp on the new hard drive </s>
<s> all you need is the original windows xp installation disk or system restore disks from the computer mfg </s>
<s> hi also if you have such problem appears rather often it better to use hard drive backup software </s>
<s> create full image of hdd and keep it on dvd cd or external hdd in your case it will be very usefull </s>
<s> and whenever you need you could easily and fast restore system as ity was before </s>
<s> really recommend i always use this way to be sure that all my important data is safe including os and all apps </s>
