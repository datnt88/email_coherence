<s> i have just installed the di 624 to set up my wireless network at home </s>
<s> i followed the instructions changed the ssid changed the admin password and enabled wep 128bit encryption with a random key </s>
<s> i was going to use wpa but my laptop does not accept wpa so i am using wep </s>
<s> my landline computer has internet security with firewall enabled and internet virus scan </s>
<s> first is there an easy way to test to see if i have adequately protected my wireless network so that no one can use my network or gain access to my home computer </s>
<s> second i haven t figured out how to properly set up the firewall on the di 624 itself </s>
<s> is this necessary or is having the firewall on my computer sufficient </s>
<s> i m a newbie at the whole wireless realm so any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> you have changed the ssid and set the encryption which is good </s>
<s> take it a step further and stop the ssid from broadcasting which will stop anyone from knowing that you have a wireless network setup </s>
<s> it should be a simple matter of choosing enable disable from the online setup </s>
<s> you did not say if you are using a wireless card or built in one in the laptop </s>
<s> if its a card then on it you should see mac and then a mix of s and letters </s>
<s> with it you can enable mac filtering using the interface which will only allow that card to interact with the router wirelessly </s>
<s> to test ask a friend with a laptop to try and use your network and if you did it correctly they will not even be able to find it in a search </s>
<s> as for the firewall it putting a wall before the one on your computer good but not something worry about </s>
<s> just use d link online support for help in setting it up </s>
<s> sorry could not give exact info as i have not use d link but the info is general for all of the big makers of routers as they all offer the same things now </s>
<s> someone else may be able to give exact info </s>
<s> 1 try to log into the network without entering the proper wep password </s>
<s> if you can t then it is working </s>
<s> note if you logged in at least one time already and the wireless connection utility saved the password in the properties of a preferred network the you will not be prompted for the password until you change the password on the router or remove the preferred neteork from your list </s>
<s> check the router manual to see if it can provide the added protection of some sort of mac filtering </s>
<s> 2 router firewall should automatically be on </s>
<s> read more about this in the router manual </s>
<s> be safer use the router firewall and at most one software firewall on each computer </s>
<s> my rule is always to have firewall antivirus and more than one antispyware program on each computer at all times </s>
<s> thanks to both people responding </s>
<s> i have incorporated all suggestions and it appears to be working well </s>
<s> cheers </s>
