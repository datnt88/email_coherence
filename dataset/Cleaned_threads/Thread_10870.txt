<s> hi i was thinking of buying a good mouse </s>
<s> i would usually use it for portable use with macbook </s>
<s> any mouse is okay as long as you don t need a power socket </s>
<s> i have big hands so ergonomics counts alot </s>
<s> i also care about the features of the mouse too </s>
<s> my choices so far microsoft arc mouse microsoft explorer explorer mini logitech vx nano you guys are welcome to give more suggestions </s>
<s> i mainly want to see the other people s opinions about these mice and any problems that may have arisen after usage since i don t want to encounter the problems with a mouse after i buy it </s>
<s> thanks alot </s>
<s> it has one and only one quirk </s>
<s> it sleeps a lot </s>
<s> that is the first millimeter of movement when it s been sitting still might be ignored </s>
<s> it s there but not a killer reason for me to change it out </s>
<s> i d buy it again </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for the advice </s>
<s> i have seen the v450 nano </s>
<s> it would be one of my choices as well </s>
<s> however i was really looking for a prosumer kind of mouse like the vx nano different from v450 nano </s>
<s> our family now has 3 of the 450 nanos </s>
<s> i m unsure why i d get the other one today </s>
