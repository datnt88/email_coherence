<s> hello i just bought a notebook with that being its processor and now am having some serious second thoughts </s>
<s> i know that the celeron is for the quot budget quot users and does not hold up too good when compared to the pentium m my question is the celeron m processor is 1 50ghz 1mb cache 400mhz fsb and the pentium m processor 730 is 1 60 ghz 2mb cache 533mhz fsb to me it looks like its just a small difference </s>
<s> i mean its just a 1 difference for the of ghz and 1 mb for the cache etc </s>
<s> what do these numbers mean anyway </s>
<s> can somebody explain it relatively </s>
<s> would a 1 difference in ghz be that big </s>
<s> if it would help i ll be using my notebook for lots of multitasking but just between word documents internet playing mp3 s and small videos </s>
<s> i wont edit videos on it or anything but will want to watch dvd s and download music </s>
<s> and for gaming just want to play sims 2 </s>
<s> oops the processor i got with my notebook being the celeron m 370 one </s>
<s> the cache and fsb is different </s>
<s> the cache won t make much of a diff </s>
<s> as for the fsb speed it determines your multiplier which determines your clock speed </s>
<s> so 1 5 won t make much of a difference to 1 6 usually if you customize a notebook you can upgrade to a 1 6 for little </s>
<s> the main difference is the features </s>
<s> the 370 lacks certain features that the pentium m comes with </s>
<s> btw good luck playing sims 2 i believe you need a direct x 9 0c compatible gfx card </s>
<s> now the gma 900 which proabbly comes with your system supports it i think but ppl had problems with it </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> the system that i got was the based system of the dell inspiron 6000 but i just upgraded the processor from the celeron 350 to the 370 now i know i should ve bought the more expensive one but hey </s>
<s> alright so what other features does the pentium have that the celeron doesn t </s>
<s> there s a website called google </s>
<s> you can search for the answer to your question there but as you ve already in grief i ll answer it for you </s>
<s> the main difference is enhanced speedstep which is only for centrino systems not actually confined to that as it has migrated to desktops </s>
<s> enhanced intel speedstep technology enhanced intel speedstep technology enables real time dynamic switching of the voltage and frequency between two performance modes based on processor demand </s>
<s> this occurs by switching the system bus ratios core operating voltage and core processor speeds without resetting the system </s>
<s> it lets you have more battery life </s>
<s> the celeron m is only a cut down pentium m as the celeron d is a cutdown of the pentium 4 roger </s>
<s> although i tried to understand that as much as i could i generally got the idea </s>
<s> oh geeez i should ve just shelled out a 100 more just to get a pentium m you think </s>
<s> alright alright thank you very much </s>
