<s> hello i have a bit of an unusual networking situation here in my home and need advice on proper configuration so i stop losing my web connection on a daily basis </s>
<s> first a basic diagram followed by an explanation as to why this is necessary lt img src quot gt the reason i m forced to have the 2nd router is that my wife telecommutes and the 1st primary router is provided by her company </s>
<s> for whatever reasons her company will not allow the wireless radio in their router to be turned on which forces me to add the 2nd wireless router for our 3 computers that require wireless access </s>
<s> my questions are 1 since the primary router has dhcp enabled i am assuming that i should disable dhcp on my wireless router </s>
<s> am i correct </s>
<s> 2 what other settings on the wireless router do i need to pay particular attention to in this situation </s>
<s> all input will be appreciated here and any suggestions you might have are particularly welcome </s>
<s> some of the cable modems have a dhcp in them so we disable on both routers and not use the wan ports </s>
<s> it seems close but a detail is missing so i can t offer anything exact except it looks very close </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> assuming that dhcp is properly configured to begin with 1 yes you would disable dhcp on the wifi router </s>
<s> 2 you would connect from lan port to lan port do not use the wan port on the wifi router </s>
<s> if you have further problems you may need to provide more details isp make model of all networking devices error messages etc </s>
