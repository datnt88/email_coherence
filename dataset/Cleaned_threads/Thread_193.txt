<s> i can get a x800 xt platinum edition agp for 230 is this a good deal </s>
<s> oh and the product number is 100 435508 the pci is 300 </s>
<s> as the ati x300 x700 x800s do not support sm3 0 or fp32 </s>
<s> the prices for the following are dropping pretty fast geforce 6800gt for 374 cad 311 usd or radeon x800xl for 310 cad 257 usd both are getting cheaper by the day but is the geforce worth the extra 64 </s>
<s> as it supports sm3 and fp32 which is needed for future games </s>
<s> if u go circuit city the geforce6800gt is only 290usd but i m not sure if its still at that price think the rebate expired today or something </s>
<s> thanks for the info il go with the newer ones </s>
<s> some guy on the gamespot forums said that the geforce is not worth it i guess it all depends on the games that are going to come out </s>
<s> it s already known that sm3 0 is going to be a requirement of upcoming games the fp precision thing hasn t been an issue for ati and probably won t be for a long time i m guessing the game will be overall too demanding beyond the card s overall ability before the fp issue arises but sm3 0 is going to be a part of upcoming games because it s a part of current games half life 2 and farcry can use it and do use it on geforce 6 cards my take is basically this if your fine buying a 300 500 card that you already know will have issues with games due to lack of feature support go for it just know that you have to upgrade sooner me personally i cannot justify purchase of a 300 600 card that won t support things i want it to support in the future i d rather be able to play the game at the settings i like 6800gt allows that i don t feel that if i m spending a fair deal of my hard earned money that i should have to compromise just to say i have a different brand or to get 2 3 higher in a benchmark </s>
<s> i think i will maybe get the 6800gt when it drops even lower but what is fp32 </s>
