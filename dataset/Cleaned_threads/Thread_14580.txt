<s> i was at best buy today looking for a new monitor and found the samsung 215tw </s>
<s> as far as i can tell this is a new product that should not be on the shelves yet </s>
<s> it is not yet on the us samsung website although it is on the canadian site and i have found only one site that has this as a pre order </s>
<s> anyway the price was good so i bought it and i was wondering if anyone knows anything about this product </s>
<s> i need at least two of them for a dual moniter setup </s>
<s> still haven t installed it but it looked prety good at bestbuy have you installed yours already </s>
<s> how does it look </s>
<s> as you can see in the previous message i just bought this samsung 215tw at bestbuy for 545 plus taxes and since i didn t see any reviews on this and bought it on the blind i m going to share my thoughts and impressions on this unit for your benefit as i think it might help you buy your lcd </s>
<s> my first impression was quot pretty solid display quot </s>
<s> it did not come with any dead pixels or back light bleeding </s>
<s> i haven t calibrated it yet but from what i can see it won t require any major adjustments </s>
<s> the screen displays crisp well defined images </s>
<s> max resolution is 1680x1050 </s>
<s> text is very readable as my wife pointed out since she does a lot of word typing etc </s>
<s> you can fit two word or windows in it without a problem and it s very readable </s>
<s> as i m typing i m standing about 3 to 4 feet behind it and it s as good as it can get </s>
<s> its base holds the monitor securely and it doesn t vibrate as you adjust it </s>
<s> its height is decently adjustable it tilts front and back and it also rotates to the vertical and i mean vertical unlike some gateway reviews i ve seen </s>
<s> all the menu buttons are on the front of the display all its inputs outputs are on the back and side for the extra audio video composite </s>
<s> it doesn t come with any usb ports if you re looking for that feature </s>
<s> it does come with the dvi cable although it s not gold tipped and the vga one </s>
<s> it also comes with a cd that contains drivers rotation software which works perfectly and a color mode tool </s>
<s> it also has built in speakers that are decent for very basic ops </s>
<s> if you want something decent get it separately </s>
<s> what else </s>
<s> set up was easy and i going to paste information that came with the cd for specs on the unit and i hope this helped you decide </s>

<s> interaction of the monitor and computer systems will provide the best operating conditions and monitor settings </s>
<s> in most cases monitor installation will proceed automatically unless the user wishes to select alternate settings </s>
<s> dot acceptable tft lcd panel manufactured by using advanced semiconductor technology with precision of 1ppm one millionth above is used for this product </s>
<s> but the pixels of red green blue and white color seem to be bright sometimes or some of black pixels could be seen </s>
<s> this is not from bad quality and you can use it without uneasiness </s>
<s> for example the number of tft lcd sub pixels that is contained in this product are 5 292 000 </s>
<s> any idea why i can t get the volume to work on the 215tw </s>
<s> do i need a cable </s>
<s> i am using the analog cable and the picture is terrific but i have no sound </s>
<s> i ve done all system checks so i have to imagine it s the monitor </s>
<s> any input would be appreciated </s>
<s> if you look underneath your monitor right by the dvi cable input there s an input for sound and that s where you need to hook the sound cable in </s>
<s> so far this monitor has been great except for one problem </s>
<s> the 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode </s>
<s> i cannot get it to work in digital mode </s>
<s> instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output </s>
<s> i can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen </s>
<s> is this expected or should i exchange the monitor </s>
<s> i was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card </s>
<s> i am sometimes amazed by how technically inept i am how embarrassing </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i had exactly the same problem with an old video card </s>
<s> it seems that some early dvi video cards can t support 1680 by 1050 over the dvi port but will do so over the vga port </s>
<s> i upgraded my video card and now have it working at 1680 by 1050 in dvi mode </s>
<s> i also got this monitor and one of the reasons i went for it over the similar lg monitor is that the samsung has the 3 video inputs </s>
<s> if you are looking for an hdtv you should get an hdtv and not a computer monitor but having the video inputs seemed useful to me </s>
<s> if you are looking at this monitor for its video inputs you should be aware that the component video will only go up to a 480p signal </s>
<s> a quot film mode quot is available for interlaced video as well </s>
<s> the dvi port is hdcp compliant so it looks like you might be able feed a hdtv signal to this monitor that way but i can t find anywhere in the docs what hdtv resolution might be supported if any </s>
<s> i d guess 720p but i do not have anything that makes a hdtv signal to test this with </s>
<s> anyway i got this as a computer monitor and am very happy with it </s>
<s> that was my suspicion since the specs specifically state it supports that resolution on both vga and dvi </s>
<s> i too bought this screen as soon as it got out even before samsung advertised it </s>
<s> funny thing is i was calling them samsung product support from bestbuy to learn more because no one knew about it and strangely enough even samsung reps couldn t tell me anything </s>
<s> i had also the gateway fpd2185w and let me tell you it is crap compared to this samsung </s>
<s> cnet s reviewers gave it close to 8 points i thought it was exaggerated </s>
<s> this samsung supports high definition input through its component with resolutions of 480p 720p and 1080i </s>
<s> very crisp and vivid picture </s>
<s> i compared the gateway side by side and the samsung takes the gateway out easily </s>
<s> i have tried it with the xbox 360 and boy i tell you it is wonderful </s>
<s> its 8ms refresh rate and 1000 1 contrast give you a superb quality </s>
<s> really if you are looking to spend nearly 600 this is your monitor </s>
<s> it gives you 3 years </s>
<s> of warranty compared to lousy 1 year with gateway </s>
<s> oh yes also their sales and support suck and shameful </s>
<s> go for the samsung </s>
<s> i have a review of this monitor in the following thread at the anandtech forum here s my pbase images of various monitor tests </s>
