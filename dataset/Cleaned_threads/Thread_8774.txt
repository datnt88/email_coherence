<s> i have a emachine t6524 amd 64 3500 and a microstar ms 7184 motherboard and i want to overclock i go to bios and i don t see it </s>
<s> look at post below </s>

<s> no overclocking a retail system </s>
<s> i have windows xp media 2005 on the emachine can i install windows xp pro w sp2 </s>
<s> sure you can install windows xp pro w sp 2 all you need is an install disk and your ready to go </s>
<s> and i also have an emachines with the same bios and motherboard unfortunatley no you can t overclock that computer </s>
<s> ok if i put windows xp pro will it still have the same bios </s>
<s> how come in my computer i go to system properties and it show 2 19ghz and 896 mb of ram when i have 1gb </s>
<s> you would still have the same bios if you upgraded </s>
<s> have a an integrated graphics card that is sharing about 128 mb from your 1 gb of system ram leaving you with 896 mb </s>
<s> to fix this you would have to get another graphics card that has dedicated video memory </s>
<s> you would also have to uninstall your current integrated graphics card and to tell the computer to not share ram anymore you would have to change a setting in the bios or the jumper setting on your motherboard </s>
<s> i can t really tell you exactly which setting or jumper to change because it s different with each motherboard bios and video card </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> your mp3 is probably malfunctioning so i would exchange it for a new one </s>
<s> just disregard that </s>
<s> i accidentally confused you with someone else i apologize </s>
<s> but the rest of the reply pertains to you </s>
<s> won t change the fact that you can t overclock </s>
<s> i agree with the statement about the integrated graphics using the ram </s>
<s> if you really want to overclock get a new retail motherborad before you install xp pro </s>
<s> can i remove the pci modern i don t even use it </s>
<s> along with any other pci device that you re not using </s>
