<s> i have bought a few refurbished computer desktops at tiger and they were gateways that have worked great and i am still using them </s>
<s> they are easy to upgrade and the cases are open and clean </s>
<s> if i was going to buy one today this is the one it would be </s>
<s> there are many on there to choose from </s>
<s> when you click on desktop computers look to the left side menu and click on refurbished </s>
<s> they always are getting new stock in so check on it every so often </s>
<s> i recently added a 650 wt psu and a ati 5770 card to a dx441x gateway </s>
<s> it had come with a 2400xt </s>
<s> now the audio plays to the tv with just a hdmi cable </s>
<s> also the appilian suite that i just bought for 79 00 online works great </s>
<s> copies videos from youtube without a hitch well worth the money </s>
<s> for 500 00 usd that computer at tiger is hard to beat </s>
<s> today all are 389 to 399 6gb ram and the usual stuff </s>
<s> if you are only going to use it for email and internet and a few basic programs no games or hd movies etc </s>
<s> try a compact desktop or net top </s>
<s> they sell for around 200 350 here in the uk which is about 300 500 </s>
<s> however if you want to spend slightly more and have a pretty good spec pc </s>
<s> i have just custom built a pc with an amd athlon 2 quad core 2 6ghz and 4gb 800mhz ram for about 400 600 minus hard drives and cd dvd drives which i took from the old pc because there is nothing wrong with them and im guessing you could do the same although you have to be careful because if they are ide most modern motherboards only have one ide connector so you either have to buy an expensive sata ide connector or try and find a motherboard with 2 ide connectors unless you only have 2 drives 1 ide cable has 2 other sockets on it but i suspect you could buy a small hard drive and cd dvd read writer for about 100 </s>
<s> if you find an external drive thats cheaper than an internal drive you can usually open them up and find a standard 3 5 quot hard drive or 5 25 quot disk drive </s>
<s> i bought an external memorex cd dvd burner and opened it up and found a standard 5 25 quot drive with standard connectors </s>

<s> my generic advice is to buy name brand </s>
<s> i think 700 is more than enough for what you want though streaming video to your tv might cost you extra </s>
