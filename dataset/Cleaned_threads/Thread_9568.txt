<s> i am thinking of going wireless and am just beginning to explore the topic </s>
<s> one thing i like to do in the evening is get a radio program on the internet and listen to it in another room </s>
<s> right now we have wires running from the computer room clear thru to the other side of the house where speakers are </s>
<s> needless to say we are always tripping over the wires </s>
<s> is there a way to do this wirelessly and if so how </s>
<s> thanks for any help you may offer </s>
<s> it will cost you anywhere from 100 to 200 bucks though </s>
<s> i got myself this linksys wireless music system </s>
<s> there are a couple just like that from diff manufacturers </s>
<s> it ok although the support is crappy </s>
<s> i did have it up and running with almost no problems </s>
<s> read reviews on amazon it helped me avoid problems </s>
<s> could not get the internet radio to work as their firmware is not updated </s>
<s> you can listen through your normal stereo or though the provides speakers </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> thanks sergv i ll look into that </s>
