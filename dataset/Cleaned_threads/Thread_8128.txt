<s> i have an old comp laying around and i want to make a gaming pc so my dad has let me open it up for an upgrade </s>
<s> byt the way the computer is an old dell dimension 3000 heres what i plan to put in a nvidia geforce 8800 gt for 250 2 gigs of ram for 69 and a 320gig hd for 80 my only concern is if my dell can run the 8800 </s>
<s> any other things u guys notice lemme know </s>
<s> it depends on the available slots </s>
<s> for video cards that s agp old pci common and pci e latest </s>
<s> check the specs of both your pc and the videocard to see if there s a match </s>
<s> also this being an old machine check if can handle 2 gb ram a 320 gb hard disk and if the cpu is fast enough to handle the games you want </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> sorry but i am an idiot when it comes to this so how would i go about checking these things </s>
<s> also can a pentium 4 work with the gt </s>
<s> it s at ouch </s>
<s> this unit has a 250 watt psu and no agp or pcie slots </s>
<s> not only does it not have a slot for the agp or newer pcie card but the power supply isn t up to the task </s>
<s> gt sorry </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so i buy a new power supply that aint that big a deal </s>
<s> and is there anything i can do to add pci slot </s>
<s> but for this video card you need agp or pcie slots which your machine doesn t have </s>
<s> a new motherboard could mean new ram new power supply and a new license to the os since it s usually locked to the old hardware </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> basically it means that you would have to replace 90 of the stuff in the computer if you wanted to upgrade your better off building or buying a new system </s>
<s> as a side note you can build your own system with specs including the parts you used for about 800 </s>
<s> something to consider </s>
<s> find one you couldn t install it in your system </s>
<s> your system doesn t have a pcie slot </s>
<s> anyone that has a decent price on the 8800gt doesn t have em in stock </s>
<s> as others have indicated you re better off getting a new box with the desired peripherals and the video card you want </s>
<s> to keep your cost down you could also look at the new ati 3800 series they are available from the 175 to the 220 and more for some vendors vapcmd </s>
<s> do ati cards also need pci e or agp </s>
<s> your dell system has built in or what some call onboard graphics quot </s>
<s> systems using onboard graphics use regular system memory for video ram </s>
<s> so if your system has 256mbs system ram and if your onboard video system was using 64mbs ram your usable system memory would be reduced to 192mbs ram </s>
<s> your dell dimension 3000 has 3 expansion slots for peripherals but they re not pcie the latest and greatest and not agp the previous generation latest and greatest it has pci </s>
<s> so the only video card you could buy and add to your current system would have to be pci </s>
<s> that s the only interface option your system has for adding peripherals like graphics cards </s>
<s> given the limitations a pci video card places on gaming performance you re better off selling the existing system and putting your into a system designed for gaming </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i don t know if you ve made a decision about your plans to upgrade </s>
<s> may i suggest you reconsider and add a few more dollars to the 400 upgrade estimate and get something more powerful and new </s>
<s> the celeron processor that comes with the dimension 3000 is not a gaming processor even if you can put the graphics card you want in it </s>
<s> that processor is barely good enough to multi task regular office applications </s>
<s> look at tigerdirect com go to motherboard cpu combos link </s>
<s> sort by price </s>
<s> they have a great motherboard with a ge force 8400 video card for around 100 after rebate </s>
<s> add a dual core cpu cpu fan and 2 gig of high speed ram 29 after rebate and you ve spent barely 400 without shipping which gives you room to ad a nice hard drive </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> the xp os that came with that xp won t transplant </s>
