<s> once in a while my computer will stop responding and i will have to shut it down via the power button </s>
<s> after doing that it wont turn back on for an hour or two </s>
<s> the power supply feels warm so i am assuming that is what is overheating </s>
<s> i am fairly computer savy but never had problems with overheating before </s>
<s> what should i do to solve the problem </s>
<s> and then minimize it the system temps will continue to be displayed in the upper right hand corner of you monitor </s>
<s> let us know what the temps shows </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> is your hard drive slow to respond </s>
<s> most power supply problems will result in plain just power loss </s>
<s> however if the there is a burning smell like electronics burning it may be power supply </s>
<s> if you have a warranty send it out if the problem is consistent </s>
<s> check in windows management for major errors </s>
<s> thanks for the tips </s>
<s> temp right now is 35 degrees since it took sitting all last night unused to get the stupid computer to turn on again </s>
<s> i guess i will have to wait for it to happen again so i can verify it is an overheating problem now that i have pc wizard </s>
<s> a quick test i use for overheating is placing a household fan at open side of case cover removed </s>
<s> if it lasts longer and or remains on good sign its overheating </s>
<s> you didn t mentioned anything about your system but if it stuffed with pc goodies or has hi end devices that generate heat thjat too must be better cooled </s>
<s> thus a well vent system and or added fans will do great </s>
<s> better now components are decent as they age tend to become less stable and fail </s>
<s> a psu should feel as its a big heat source so don t conclude its that alone but a cheap or over taxed psu will become a candidate for failure if cooling isn t controlled </s>
<s> i wish i could offer more concrete advice but have found a weak or bad psu a constant source of problems when pcs have added devices bad cooling location and or overwhelmed cooling </s>
<s> taken as a whole a decent installed psu capable of handling all power demands and well ventilated case does wonders </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
