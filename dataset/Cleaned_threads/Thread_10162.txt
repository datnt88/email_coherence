<s> i recently reformated my xp machine and re installed windows xp </s>
<s> since then i have not been able to connect to the internet through my router there are several other machines on the network which dont have a problem connecting </s>
<s> it seems to be nothing to do with the router as i plugged my cable into the back of another pc and the internet ran fine </s>
<s> my tcp ip settings are such that it obtains an ip adress automatically but the ip adress it is getting i think is wrong </s>
<s> the other pc s get ip addresses starting 192 168 xx xx however mine gets something completely different in device manager my network card says it is working fine </s>
<s> please help phucbv </s>
<s> beside xp did you install drivers for motherboard video audio lan and what else </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what is the ip range you are getting </s>
<s> have you tried ipconfig release then ipconfig renew from a command prompt </s>
<s> alternative is to repair the network connection in network properties </s>
<s> i ve re formatted before and not had any problems i ve never installed a driver for the motherboard </s>
<s> everytime i ve re formatted i have installed audio and video drivers </s>
<s> i have tried to repair the connection in network properties and it fails to renew the ip address </s>
<s> i didnt know about the ipconfig release and ipconfig renew commands i will try that and see what happens </s>
<s> i have also tried copying the settings from one of the other pc s on the network which can connect to the internet setting my own ip and gateway and dns etc with a different ip </s>
<s> when i do this and start up windows explorer to see if it is going to connect it tries for longer before timing out and failing than when it obtains the ip automatically </s>
<s> could there be a problem with the network card even though in device manage it says it is working properly thanks for helping i ve run out of ideas jules </s>
<s> i ve posted a reply to both re s in one message which is in the reply to r proffit s message cheers jules </s>
<s> quot i ve re formatted before and not had any problems quot so you seen to have fixed it </s>
<s> or maybe not </s>
<s> be careful with what you write as to drivers many don t understand the driver issues </s>
<s> in short microsoft doesn t do them all </s>
<s> we get to do all the drivers when it doesn t work </s>
<s> seek out those motherboard drivers and when networking don t install that firewall until you get the network up and working then flip it on </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i went on the internet and got the latest driver for my network card and whacked that on and it went </s>
<s> thanks for ur patience and help jules </s>
<s> the order is important so you know what breaks it again but with all the pests out there for xp you get to download the patches and finally a firewall </s>
<s> best of continued luck bob </s>
