<s> i have sony vaio vgc rc210g it comes with an ati x300 pci e needless to say it s a bit low on the gaming scale </s>
<s> so i was looking to upgrade to say an ati 1900 xtx or similar </s>
<s> i was wondering if any one with a rc210g has upgraded there graphics card and to what ati nvidia </s>
<s> also how well it works for you </s>
<s> looks ominous </s>
<s> maybe that model only got one sale </s>
<s> judging from reviews such as sony uses a massive amount power and like all things with a big name badge it likely doesn t come with an over specified psu </s>
<s> in other words it already uses a lot of power and the psu it comes with will not be an expensive model with a massive overhead for a huge 3d upgrade </s>
<s> huge </s>
<s> the graphics card you re after requires more power than any other option which is likely to be doomed to failure in a ynos pc you d only be compounding possible problems and you might have to consider a psu upgrade which may or may not the latter is more likely be an option </s>
<s> or you could opt for a graphics card which doesn t draw so much power </s>
<s> no doubt with a trendy ynos something as horrible even though it works as this would be out of the question too good luck in your endeavours though gb </s>
<s> thanks for the info </s>
