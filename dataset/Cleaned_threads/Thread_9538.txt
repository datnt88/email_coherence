<s> i have two usb ports on the front of a pc that i use for backups </s>
<s> for no apparent reason they stopped working today </s>
<s> i plugged my printer into the ports to verify if they work and they did work with the printer </s>
<s> when i try to do a backup i get a message saying the port drive does not exist </s>
<s> i went into the device manager and those two usb ports don t show there either </s>
<s> help does anyone have any thoughts on what to do next </s>
<s> about all you can do is check to make sure the connections are good </s>
<s> you have have wiring from the front ports to the mb header </s>
<s> remove the connectors and plug them back in </s>
<s> make sure the pins in the connectors are fully seated as well </s>
<s> pulled pins are notorious for causing connection failures </s>
<s> i have had usb ports go bad and i suspect due to static discharge </s>
<s> when this happened to me however the ports didn t disappear but showed as having a problem </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> yes all of the rear ports are working except when i plug in an external drive of any sort </s>
<s> i know the connection is good on the front ports as the printer works in them </s>
<s> i d look to system restore to a day ago </s>
<s> will this delete any new data added since one day ago </s>
<s> we only lose what we don t backup </s>
<s> system restore is detailed in this next link </s>
<s> can i ask why folk don t backup </s>
<s> i mean any nasty could arrive and blam </s>
<s> where s the backup </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> did a system restore and usb still won t read any mass storage device </s>
<s> i backup everyday </s>
<s> often enough most frt </s>
<s> usb ports are connected by a cable harness inside the pc to the header on the mtrbd </s>
<s> with power off locate and reseat several times the connection and retry for use </s>
<s> if it still fails then it very well could have blown the usb chip that s the hub typically runs 2 usb ports </s>
<s> unless this is a generic type of port placement then you have to install a satellite hub using a rear usb port which can add 2 8 new ports google for such </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> and if there is a hardware issue i test for that by booting up a live cd ubuntu or other </s>
<s> no install needed and i can test the hardware </s>
