<s> hello i have an old compaq desktop whose onboard video circuits have gone bad </s>
<s> but i also have an ati radeon 9800 pro video card on the machine so i figured i d just use its display output as a substitute </s>
<s> when i boot up i get the usual bios text and the windows xp splash screen displayed normally but when xp continues to load a suddenly get a letterboxed display with about ten smeared copies of the xp logon some even look like they are being reflected off the sides of the monitor tube so i obviously can t read what s going or or use the system </s>
<s> although the ati card was been installed ages ago i obviously never used its monitor output </s>
<s> would this be a driver problem of some kind </s>
<s> any ideas how i could get back in action short of trying to replace my motherboard </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help </s>
<s> the video display settings </s>
<s> to fix this we boot to safe mode and select 800x600 at 60hz refresh ok our way out and then boot normally </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you said it was an old machine and you d been using the on board video </s>
<s> obviously there s a possibility of a driver problem </s>
<s> as bob says set your refresh and resolution to something safe </s>
<s> but what i d do is make sure the on board video is disabled and i d uninstall the radeon card from the display adapters in your hardware </s>
<s> it will show two displays one is analog and the other is digital </s>
<s> get rid of both </s>
<s> as well go to control panel add remove and look for any ati software installation such as it s catalyst suite and get rid of it </s>
<s> download the current drivers from the manufacturer s web site </s>
<s> ati is now an amd owned company so go there </s>
<s> don t get the catalyst suite </s>
<s> just get the driver and install it first </s>
<s> if you feel the catalyst extras are worth it you can get that later once everything is working </s>
<s> i don t care for it </s>
<s> one issue you could have is if your card wasn t made by ati but one of their quot partners quot </s>
<s> there were many </s>
<s> time was when you had to look for reference drivers for such cards as installing the oem drivers resulted in errors </s>
<s> hopefully that won t be the case with yours </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i found that in safe mode my display looks good </s>
<s> but i also found i could set a new display size but that the box to set refresh rate was greyed out </s>
<s> so no joy after rebooting </s>
<s> i will move on to try other advice such as re installing the ati card and drivers </s>
<s> thanks for your help bob ps for what i need running in safe mode is also acceptable just tedious </s>
