<s> another question for those in the know </s>
<s> i presently have a new desktop pc which is connected to basic dial up </s>
<s> my father has now decided he wants a new computer </s>
<s> my isp is bell south and bell south tells me to have 2 pc s in the same house using basic dial up for internet service would require 2 separate phone lines in the house each phone line having it s own basic dial up account </s>
<s> bell south did tell me another choice that i would have is to keep just one phone line and i could connect both computers to that one phone line and use bell south s dsl high speed internet service </s>
<s> since there would be two computers on one phone line sharing the dsl bell south recommended that i go with their mid level dsl service at 34 95 a month </s>
<s> now here s where things start to get confusing bell south says i d benefit from joining their home networking plan for an additional 5 00 a month but if i did i d also have to purchase a dsl modem a router and either a router adapter or a dsl adapter which would be connected to the second computer in the house </s>
<s> my question is this </s>
<s> would it be more feasable for me to go with 2 separate phone lines having basic dial up service on each phone line or to go as bell south has recommended stay with one phone line go with their mid level dsl plan which both computers could share after purchasing all of the required dsl equipment from bell south to make everything work </s>
<s> which way should i consider going </s>
<s> feedback would certainly be appreciated on this one </s>

<s> you would be much better off with the dsl </s>
<s> you can get a router which allows you to share that boradband you have with up to 4 pcs </s>
<s> say if the pc s are close you can share the broadband via an ethernet cable hooked to your router </s>
<s> there are no additional monthly fees when you do use a router </s>
<s> you can get a wireless router which allows you to share the broadband to any computer in the house wirelessly this also allows laptops to connect wirlessly also </s>
<s> problem is with a wireless router it has a range on how far it can go </s>
<s> you can get a mimo router for about 100 00 </s>
<s> in addition if you do get a wirless router your computers will need a wireless adapter </s>
<s> a wirless adapter can go for about 35 40 </s>
<s> you should get the same make as the maker of your router </s>
<s> the wirless adapter allows you to take the wirless signals coming from your router and allowing you to connect to the internet </s>
<s> wireless adapters can either be plugged via usb or a cheaper alternative be installed into a desktop via pc slot </s>
<s> if you do get a wirless router get the belkin pre n wirless router i have seen it go for 100 </s>
<s> this router is extremelty powerful and has a very long range and incorporates tomorrows technology </s>
<s> remember your computers can be hooked up to a wireless router with an ethernet cord </s>
<s> i have dsl with the modem hooked up to the first pc </s>
<s> i have added a new pc both are xpsp2 in an office in another building same phone line </s>
<s> i would like to connect to the internet on the new pc and was told by isp to use a router </s>
<s> i bought a linksys etherfast cable dsl routher with 4 port switch but cannot get connected </s>
<s> the phone line works but as soon as i connect the phone cord from the filter that houses both phone and dsl into the router no phone and no connection </s>
<s> when i manually set the ip address on the new pc it says connected but ie says not connected when i try different websites </s>
