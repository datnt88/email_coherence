<s> i have a frustrating question </s>
<s> over the past two weeks i have been dealing with a video problem on my dell dninspiron 8500 2 2 ghz mp4 512 mb ram nvidia geforce4 4200 64mb go video card </s>
<s> after two weeks of searching and toiling and reading thousands of community forum posts the culprit ended up being a little pin that tells the computer to go into standby mode that had worked its way out of place and was sending a continuous signal to go into standby </s>
<s> i fixed it rather easily once identified inspite of finding many posts from dell representatives stating that the mother board needed to be replaced for this problem </s>
<s> if i had stopped there everything would have been fine </s>
<s> unfortunately for me while searching the dell knowledge base i also discovered that dell recommended a bios upgrade for my video card </s>
<s> since i was steeped indealing with video card issues at the time once i fixed the pressing problem i decided to follow their recommendation and flash the bios to update my video card </s>
<s> they offered two options and being slightly lazy i decided to go with the easiest method which entailed downloading the flash utility and running it from my hard drive </s>
<s> i followed the directions explicitily and quit all applications before starting then launched the utility and ran it </s>
<s> it then posted an additional window that stated this should take a few seconds to complete </s>
<s> after 10 minutes i was starting to get a little worried </s>
<s> i clicked on the original window only to be told that it was no longer responding </s>
<s> of course i was very concerned about what just happened and you guessed it upon restart i got nothing </s>
<s> the hard drive light flashes a couple times but never spins up </s>
<s> i get no splash screen and clearly it just stops at that point </s>
<s> now i am trying to determine if there is any way to reflash the bios blindly without an operational lcd </s>
<s> i tried making a bootable floppy disk but my laptop will not boot from it possibly because it doesn t realize i switched the cd drive with a floppy drive </s>
<s> i am trying to make a bootable cd but not sure how to get the flash utility to run automatically </s>
<s> i am desparately searching for any ideas </s>
<s> do i really need to buy a new video card </s>
<s> can it really not be re flashed </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> please </s>
<s> i had deja vu when reading this post </s>
<s> my experience is with the exact same equipment and pretty much the same steps you followed with the exact same unhappy results </s>
<s> i wish i had a solution but i have pretty much given up </s>
<s> i hope someone replys to this post with an idea </s>
<s> try using an external usb floppy drive for the bios flash </s>
<s> if that doesn t work contact dell and complain to them that you followed their recommendation to update the video card bios firmware </s>
<s> their recommended procedure and softwae bricked your video card and they need to rectify this </s>
<s> a solution would be a new video card or a utility that repairs the video card bios </s>
<s> i ve not received any good ideas that have worked from this post or the others i have fished with </s>
<s> i tried reflashing from a boot disk as some have suggested but the system fails the post tests and never proceeds far enough to actually boot up </s>
<s> i did talk to the it person at my place of work and he basically told me my only recourse was to buy a new video card </s>
<s> unfortunately because the cards are fairly machine specific the word quot new quot refers to a used card purchased from ebay the only source i could find </s>
<s> it will run about 120 with shipping </s>
<s> this is one mistake that i will not make again and that will start with not buying dell laptops </s>
<s> i ve always been fond of apple computer and this only reinforces my reason why </s>
<s> i see a macpro on the horizon </s>
<s> good luck with you endevors </s>
<s> if you find anything that helps please let em know </s>
<s> i fully agree with you </s>
<s> this is dell s fault </s>
<s> they should pay for the replacement </s>
<s> the problem is contacting dell s tech service and dealing with the hours of waiting and language barrier to likely have to fight repeatedly with them over this issue </s>
<s> outsourcing is done for one reason to save money and that isn t only related to cheaper labor it s related to poorer service </s>
<s> i ve this time chosen to bypass the dell tech service nightmare and pay the price for a replacement card </s>
<s> they absolutely however need to take the harddrive bios flash solution off of their website </s>
<s> thanks for the comment </s>
<s> yea told a friend i would reformatt and update their pc installed all the updates got to the vga bios update and now i own a laptop i cant afford unless i fix it </s>
