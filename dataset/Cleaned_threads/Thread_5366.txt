<s> ok so it is not starting up i think my problem lies in the front panel connectors i think i am connecting them wrong </s>
<s> the name of the connector that turns on the computer is called m b sw which is something i havent seen before no matter where i plug it it wont work </s>
<s> it will not give a sign of life </s>
<s> if you really need to know my specs here they are intel core 2 duo 2 8ghz 2gigs ram 1 stick 500gb green power hard drive </s>
<s> 9800gt 1gb </s>
<s> 300w psu </s>
<s> i am pretty sure i connected everything right </s>
<s> this is very frustrating as it is my first build and i thought it was going to be simpler than that anyways this is why i am posting here </s>
<s> any help is appreciated </s>
<s> but what do the manual say </s>
<s> when it works it is simple but when it s not and there are no indication s of the problem then that s a pain </s>
<s> any kind of indication at all when that power switch is pressed </s>
<s> is there a led on the motherboard that says 5v is on </s>
<s> i just press the button and here the echo of the click i really do not know what the problem is </s>
<s> take a metal object like the tip of a screwdriver and try shorting the two pins where you insert the power switch wires from the front panel leave all the other pins disconnected </s>
<s> if it starts its a problem with your front panel headers if it still doesnt start atleast you know there s nothing wrong with your front panel connections then we can look at what else could be the problem </s>
<s> quot 9800gt 1gb </s>
<s> 300w psu quot let s google the common 9800gt card and what it wants for watts </s>
<s> quot minimum recommended system power w 400 w quot your psu is 75 of the recommended value </s>
<s> missing this by such a wide margin is one likely cause </s>
<s> who designed this machine </s>
<s> i just realized now that you tell me that my 9800gt requires an extra 6pin connector to be connected to it directly from the psu and i couldn t find it now i understand 300w is way too low </s>
<s> thanks for telling me </s>
<s> is there any chance i might have damaged any components by doing this </s>
<s> the chances are slim that anything bad happened </s>
<s> if you had smoke coming from chips and the old star trek hit by klingon fire effects then you wouldn t be asking </s>
<s> it probably means im going to have to change my case since i do not think it will accomodate a 500 700w psu </s>
<s> this is such a waste of money and time </s>
<s> luckily you guys are here </s>
<s> money and time if we don t learn by our mistakes </s>
<s> computer cases aren t as expensive as some may think while you don t want to go the el cheapo route you don t have to spend 900 for the thermaltake level 10 you can usually get a decent starter case for under 100 and power supplies don t have to put you in the poorhouse either </s>
<s> thank you for the advice im going to go buy these this weekend i will message you when i get them and tell you if it works </s>
<s> should i go directly for 600w </s>
<s> larger psus </s>
<s> check the measurements of the one you have and check the measurements of the ones you re considering </s>
<s> post back if you have a question we ll be here </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> and it was alsmost 2cm larger in height and width length doesnt matter </s>
<s> so i think im going to have to change my case any suggestions </s>
<s> should i get a full sized tower so i can be tranquil </s>
<s> how much money do you want or can afford to spend on a new case </s>
<s> see my previous post for budget minded cases from newegg </s>
<s> 150 dollars max </s>
<s> there are a number of good cases at newegg for 150 and under some with the psu opening at the top most on the bottom quite a few with side windows if that s your thing </s>
<s> the antec 900 mid tower is at the top of the list i used to have this case it s a good one and is just shy of 100 </s>
<s> what s the max config </s>
<s> more than 1 optical drive </s>
<s> more than 1 hard drive </s>
<s> floppy drive </s>
<s> are there any space limitations </s>
<s> is that 150 for both the case and the psu </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> is the antec 900 a full tower </s>
<s> i m going for full tower now because i do not want to deal with space problems anymore </s>
<s> psu 500 600w that fits in a relatively small case </s>
<s> case one that can fit a 500 600w psu prices psu under 70 case under 100 is that possible </s>
<s> please find something </s>
<s> antec 900 mid tower 99 99 will hold a 750 watt psu without any problem a link to the manufacturers website cooler master silent pro 600 modular psu 69 99 cooler master s website </s>
<s> thanks a lot for the feedback </s>
