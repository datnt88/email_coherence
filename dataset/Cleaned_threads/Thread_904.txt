<s> i know how stupid this sounds but i need help with my epson workforce 600 i got a paper jam which i cleared </s>
<s> i also canceled the printing job </s>
<s> the printer tells me to turn it off after i cleared it </s>
<s> but there is no power button just a button to stop clear settings </s>
<s> i pressed that i pressed the start button but all i get is flashing green lights </s>
<s> i ve look carefully at the booklet but there is no diagram showing all the parts of the printer </s>
<s> there has to be a power button somewhere </s>
<s> i checked the epson troubleshooting page but it s no help </s>
<s> i think i m going crazy </s>
<s> please help me </s>
<s> but let s talk about clearing those print jobs </s>
<s> it s slightly technical but it is one of the annoying things that i deal with every month </s>
<s> here s a few articles about it </s>
<s> pick the one you like </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> interesting note via the specs as its energy complaint and that means it goes to quot sleep quot thus it may not have a switch </s>
<s> honestly you have to look over the unit and go from that </s>
<s> otherwise place on a power strip and shutdown 100 that way after you allow it to go to sleep idle </s>
<s> basically the ptr </s>
<s> is using a logic circuit to keep it on off as i suspect very much like a pc </s>
<s> if that s the case check for any s w feature to control that action </s>
<s> that s my best guess as so many printers out there </s>
<s> and yes imho that s not a good thing </s>
<s> of course you can pull the ac plug </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the power on off is that button on the frt </s>
<s> top of printer </s>
<s> press it once to power off </s>
<s> if it blinks etc </s>
<s> for some time allow it to do so it should finally go off </s>
<s> however going off maybe more of going to sleep </s>
<s> the manual i quickly reviewed offers that up to 5min </s>
<s> may pass before it shuts down or sleeps </s>
<s> that could also be related to any error condition as the blinking could refer to an error status verify </s>
<s> fyi power button switch have the universal symbol of a arched circle with a line and dot in it </s>
<s> make notice of that on other pc devices maybe the pc </s>
