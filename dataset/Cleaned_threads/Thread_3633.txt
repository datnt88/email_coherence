<s> i have 2 dell pcs and 1 sony laptop </s>
<s> they are all 3 5 years old but fully updated to xp pro </s>
<s> i juse a linksys 802 b g router </s>
<s> the laptop uses a linksys card and the pcs connect via ethernet </s>
<s> i have no problem with any of them except when i am online every 10 minutes or so i get the work offline </s>
<s> or try again </s>
<s> error message </s>
<s> often i get the page not found message when refreshing </s>
<s> sometimes i can t connect to the internet at all </s>
<s> when i hook the cable modem directly to the computer w o the router there is no problem </s>
<s> to fix the problem i go into my network places network connectons and right click on the network connection icon and click repair </s>
<s> this fixes the problem every time </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea what the problem is and how i can fix it </s>
<s> a solution is much appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i had exactly the same problem and my isp identified it as being a problem with linksys </s>
<s> i upgraded firmware but the problem persisted </s>
<s> the linksys router seems to lose your settings although the settings appear to be there </s>
<s> so all you need to do is open the linksys settings page and click on save settings </s>
<s> another related problem is if you have more than one network named on the router eg home and linksys i deleted my home network and run on the default linksys network now and since then the problem has not returned </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> also i think i only have one network name but how do i know </s>
<s> i can t find anything on my pc that says linksys </s>
<s> nothing in start menu program files search nothing </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> open your network connections click on properties then check your preferreed network list </s>
<s> i appreciate it but can t figure it out </s>
<s> i can t find anything on my computer that says linksys </s>
