<s> question how do i change the ip address of a network printer with windows xp home or 2k </s>
<s> details we had a network consisting of 3 pcs and 1 network printer nashuatec d420 using ricoh aficio 200 250 drivers in the 195 195 195 x ip address range </s>
<s> after installing broadband i had to set the ip addresses to be dynamically obtained by dhcp in range 192 168 1 2 192 168 1 253 </s>
<s> the printer does not have the ability to change the ip address via it s control panel </s>
<s> i know the mac address and tried to allocate an ip address using arp with and without dhcp reserving that address without any success using 192 168 1 x and 195 195 195 x on the pc running arp </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> all network printers i have seen have the ability to obtain an ip adress via dhcp or can be set to user a static ip </s>
<s> i would look at the documentation of the printer and set the printer with a static ip </s>
<s> thanks but unfortunately i have no documentation for the printer and couldn t find anything via google or nashuatec </s>
<s> the printer doesn t provide the option to change the ip address on it s menu thus i m forced to do it with software </s>
