<s> i want some opinions out there </s>
<s> if saving money and getting more for your money was your main concerns what would be better building your own pc from the ground up or buying a pre configured one </s>
<s> i have a good source to build one but i don t know if i want all the hassle that goes along with that </s>
<s> i ve had a pc built for me before by a family friend and it was just too much hassle to take it over and see if he had the time to fix it etc </s>
<s> but i don t want to pay huge inflated prices for a pre config d system either but have any repairs be easier </s>
<s> the one i m considering has a few extended warranties built into the price already </s>
<s> i m not a gamer video editor type just a basic surfer who does a little business on my system </s>
<s> i m not a gamer </s>
<s> if i price out the parts for a pc and a monitor and software i can t come close to what i can buy a package deal for </s>
<s> but that assumes that all the parts of a pkg deal are of any value to you </s>
<s> i m not looking to buy a new machine but every so often i visit dell s bargain shop nice stuff yesterdays model cheap </s>
<s> there is a benefit to building your own </s>
<s> you gain a certain amount of knowledge about how the parts fit together and when it does not work quite right you just go in an fix it </s>
<s> low end pcs 500 or so can t be beaten price wise but they are usually either bottom barrel components or have little if any expanision capabilities </s>
<s> once you move up to a mid range pc 1000 building your own becomes more competitive </s>
<s> when you build your own you can choose where you want to put your money ram vs cpu for example and tailor it far better than any custom configurator </s>
