<s> i recently installed a third harddrive in my comp for more storage space </s>
<s> after turning the comp back on and formatting the partition i have had nothing but trouble </s>
<s> the comptuer is going slow </s>
<s> eg playing winamp if i try to open firefox it will start stuttering it is truly horrible is there any way to find out what the problem is </s>
<s> my system 512 ram 2 4 ghz pentium 4 the harddrives 80 gig primary 2 secondary at 200 gig and 160 the 160 is the new one any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> if the cpu usage is constantly 100 then it is your cpu </s>
<s> if not check physical memory </s>
<s> if there is not much available then that might be why </s>
<s> i honestly don t see why the hard drives would give you any trouble anywhere </s>
<s> i checked my physical memory and increased it </s>
<s> does it matter which drive the physical memory is on </s>
<s> i honestly tried putting physical memory on all drives i dont even know what that does the cpu is not constantly at 100 it just gets jammed up it seems </s>
<s> if i try to do things at once the comp slows down considerably </s>
<s> if the added hard drive in some manner has caused the cpu to run at a higher temperature it is possible that the cpu is being internally throttled down due to the higher temperature </s>
<s> the stuttering would be typical </s>
<s> maybe you blocked airflow in some way </s>
<s> the drive adds more heat but that alone should not do it </s>
<s> did you accidently disable a fan </s>
<s> if it is a heat issue wouldnt the problem be more progressive and more pronounced over time </s>
<s> right now i start the computer after hours of it being off and it will stutter </s>
<s> i keep it on for a week straight and there is no worsening or improvement of the situation </s>
<s> im sorry if i sound stupid saying this i am definitely no expert when it comes to computers hence why i am here lol </s>
<s> installed the new hd gt system slows reomve new hd gt what happens </s>
<s> where are all of your drives located hd and optical </s>
<s> where is your drive with the operating system located </s>
<s> primary ide master primary ide slave secondary ide master secondary ide slave sata other </s>
<s> overheat in minutes or fractions thereof </s>
<s> in the computer helath section of the bios after it has been on for a few minutes hit the reset and then look in the bios </s>
