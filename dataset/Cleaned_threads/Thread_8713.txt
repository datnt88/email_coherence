<s> how often do you clean out the dust bunnies inside your computer </s>
<s> once a month how much did you find </s>
<s> once every few months how much did you find </s>
<s> once a year how much did you find </s>
<s> once every couple of years how bad was it </s>
<s> whenever i feel like it whenever i start to hear strange noises whenever i do hardware upgrades never have why have you never cleaned </s>
<s> i didnt know bunnies could live in my computer if do regularly clean out your computer s innards share with us how you go about it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> lee </s>
<s> when cleaning out your pc s dust bunnies do not use a vacuum </s>
<s> the static discharge from the air going through the vacuum hose will destroy components inside the case </s>
<s> don t say i didn t warn ya </s>
<s> i don t buy the idea that dust bunnies or even the cat hair that s everywhere else in my office can get inside my intel imac </s>
<s> all the vents are on the bottom which is several inches above the desktop </s>
<s> does my computer suck it in like plankton </s>
<s> or is this just another reason to be glad i don t have a pc </s>
<s> i am a non smoker and my house is heated with electricity </s>
<s> i do not leave my computer on 24 7 so i find that once a year is plenty </s>
<s> i also have two 80mm exhaust fans and one 80mm intake fan that do a great jub of cooling down inside of my 30 inch tall tower </s>
<s> i have serviced computer in houses of smokers and advise them to open their case and clean out dust at least once every two months </s>
<s> your environment is probably the most important factor in the frequency of cleaning </s>
<s> fireplaces coal or wood stoves forced hot air heat living in a dusty neighborhood smoking or just an old dirty house will increase the amount of airborn dust and therefore the need to clean your computer more frequently </s>
<s> some heatsinks are more prone to hold dust than others so you have to look closely at that factor also </s>
<s> air intake filters help to reduce the dust that gets inside your computer but they also reduce the the cool air that passes through your computer the three case fans in my tower assure that dust does not move slowly through my tower </s>
<s> heat is your computers worst enemy so keep the air moving through and make sure that it is cooling your processor and your video processor </s>
<s> plugged heatsinks just don t cool as well </s>
<s> i have 2 female cats who must be on my large table i use as my command central </s>
<s> they shed of course </s>
<s> the grates on my dell tower catch a lot of the hair but it mats in there and is not all that visible </s>
<s> i use those rollers that use sticky masking tape as lint pickup vehicles </s>
<s> i use these first and often </s>
<s> if your fan seems to run faster this is a clue to blocked grates vents </s>
<s> if i do this both front and back the inside seems to stay pretty clean </s>
<s> using something sticky to grab the dust boogers avoids the horror of using a blast of anything that can mean disaster </s>
<s> many people who claim to know say household dust is made up over 50 of sloughed off skin cells </s>
<s> the more people in your household the more dust and real sizeable dust </s>
<s> it is worth consideration especially with a number of small folks who they say shed more quickly </s>
<s> old folks like me i don t even leave fingerprints anymore </s>
<s> i monitor my system temperatures using speedfan software when i notice the temperatures climbing or remaining high i clean it out </s>
<s> the quantities of the materials i find are usually low but enough to effect the operation of the pc </s>
<s> in the summer we might do it a bit more </s>
<s> i also filter the air flowing into the pc to keep dust out as long as possible </s>
<s> furnace filter works well and can simply be cut and taped to the inlet openings </s>
<s> brief momentary stalls hangs or crashes usually are indications of over heating </s>
<s> these occur most often after long term system operation or under demanding uses like gaming scans and i o indexing of the hard drive </s>
<s> check if dust is the problem first before moving on to more drastic and costly measures </s>
<s> major crashes can occur with major dust clogging </s>
<s> if this is the trouble then the user is to blame and needs to do a better job of routine cleaning </s>
<s> how s your maintenance </s>
<s> warning opening the tower laptop during the term of the warranty can void it </s>
<s> see the documentation that came with your computer for details or contact the machine s manufacture </s>
<s> this thread is untracked </s>
<s> i clean out the dust bunnies from my pc every few months </s>
<s> i learned to do this many years ago when a pc i then owned kept overheating causing it to freak out and freeze up </s>
<s> the dust acts as insulation not allowing heat to dissipate from the components properly </s>
<s> the fans get all dust covered and do not move enough air over heat sinks that are covered with dust and so forth </s>
<s> chasing out the dust bunnies simply prolongs computer life </s>
<s> i clean my pc s about once a month </s>
<s> but i have two cats and they shed more than the vet tells me they should </s>
<s> if you are a smoker have little kids or any pets i would reccomend a monthly cleaning cycle </s>
<s> i have heard that vacumes are bad i ve been working with pc s for years and i haven t had any problems </s>
<s> if you are worried about static they sell cans of compressed air at most electronics stores wal mart also carries the cans take the pc into the garage take the covers off and give it a good blow down </s>
<s> i personally use an air compressor handy in the garage and use a shop vac to get the trouble stuff off of the case </s>
<s> i wouldn t reccomend using a vacume with a brush inside the case on the electronics </s>
<s> i haven t had any trouble but there is a lot of static associated with vacumes </s>
<s> my first computer several years ago needed servicing </s>
<s> i have a parrot </s>
<s> the computer was sitting on carpet </s>
<s> i received a call from the service tech saying that when he opened the computer feathers which had filled up the inside came flying out all over the store </s>
<s> he quickly went outside and finished emptying the case </s>
<s> now i have an air purifier within 3 feet of the computer which is up off the floor in a room without carpet or birds </s>
<s> recently i volunteered to do some upgrades on a neighbor s computer </s>
<s> when i opened her computer there was a mouse nest complete with plastic toys and food inside it but no dust bunnies or mouse </s>
<s> my neighbor agreed that it was time to buy a new computer </s>
<s> dust bunnies </s>
<s> ever since i installed a dust doberman i ve not seen a single dust bunny </s>
<s> i used to do it whenever i changed something inside maybe 2 or 3 times a year quite the project especially these days with the cpu cooler fins and a dust depositor right above </s>
<s> but just in there today after 3 months zip when i built this current pc i went with a full tower </s>
<s> added 4 120mm fans and put filters over all the vents in the case and over the fans </s>
<s> today i vacuumed off the filters </s>
<s> not even a trace of dust inside </s>
<s> wonderfull </s>
<s> they make filters for house forced air vents about 4 inches wide and 12 or so long and about 1 2 inch thich easy to cut and i just taped them every where air would get into the case </s>
<s> i used to have huge bunnies until i did a major upgrade to my pc </s>
<s> besides all the hardware i added i needed extra fans to keep it cool </s>
<s> i now have 6 fans total 3 intake 3 exhaust and all intakes have filters </s>
<s> my computer sits 12 quot off the floor in a quot rack quot the fans are all controllable with 4 temp monitors inside the case </s>
<s> when i change the filters the inside of the pc gets a cleaning </s>
<s> i find very little dust </s>
<s> you and your neighbor have bigger problems than just your computer </s>
<s> somehow i inherited a quot dust cougar quot and since then the quot dust doberman quot has failed to function </s>
<s> in reality i never clean the inside of my computers and have never experienced any problems whatsoever that relate to dust </s>
<s> my prior unit was an early edition gateway that i used for 5 years without any problems </s>
<s> currently i have a dell dimension that is about 4 5 years old and has never been opened up </s>
<s> a lot of folks do more damage than good when they attempt to clean the innards in an improper way </s>
<s> i had my last computer for 10 years running win 98 and only a few months ago did i finally break down buy an new one and only because the other one was soooooo slow </s>
<s> anyway during the 10 years i only cleaned it out once when i added memory </s>
<s> i was reading this weeks current c net question of the week concerning a noisy computer and it finally occurred to me that s probably why my last computer was sooooo loud </s>
<s> so that leads me to my question </s>
<s> how do i clean out the inside </s>
<s> simply take off the cover and blow i d feel better about canned air i m afraid i d suck out something i wasn t supposed to if i used a vaccume </s>
<s> another post warned about possibly voiding your warranty if opening the cover during the warranty period </s>
<s> problem is this is a smoking house on a dirt road with 2 dogs a few blocks from the beach lots of sand </s>
<s> so i don t want to void my warranty but waithing a couple of years before cleaning doesn t sound like such a great idea either </s>
<s> what would you do </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> bridget </s>
<s> probably one of the main problems with dust is that it accummulates on the blads of fans which will in time wear out the bearing of the fans and then the fan starts wobbling cools less causing more major problems </s>
<s> i took a look at my 6 mo old dell xps and the grates in the front are covered with dust </s>
<s> i am in a newly constructed house and i am still collecting quite a bit of construction dust in my furnace filters </s>
<s> if i don t use a vacuum how can i remove this </s>
<s> if i use canned air it will blow it inside the case </s>
<s> you can blow the dust out of the cooling fins with a can of compressed air and then pick up what ever dust you can your computer should be shut off if you remove 85 or 90 of the dust you have eliminated 85 or 90 of your danger </s>
<s> there are lots of little tricks like a small battery operated computer vacume which might even pick up some of the dust but one of my favorites is a turkey baster which you can use to blow or to suck up dust </s>
<s> i have seen people blow with their breath which contains a great deal of moisture and other contaminants that is not a good thing </s>
<s> just be careful and be gentle and don t be too fussy </s>
<s> get out any heavy accumulation of dust </s>
<s> i had completely forgotten about warranties </s>
<s> i don t know ho many computer manufacturers still void the warranty if you open the case but if it is under warranty and it starts to run at all slower use the warranty and let them clean out the dust </s>
<s> after the warranty expires you will have nothing to loose </s>
<s> fans do tend to get noisy as they wear out </s>
<s> if iot is loud or if you happen to break a blade while cleaning it is not a serious problem if you replace the fan </s>
<s> case fans are very standard 60mm 80mm and 120mm with standard bolting paterns </s>
<s> they are very inexpensive and very easy to replace </s>
<s> some come with an extra lead for speed monitoring but unless your computer is equiped for that don t bother </s>
<s> you can install lighted fans to jazz up your computer but the lights are not vey bright </s>
<s> fans come in ball bearing double ball bearing and sleave bearing models </s>
<s> i have never sen any real data to proove to me that any one type is better </s>
<s> a more expensive fan might last a bit longer than a cheap one </s>
<s> 8 to 18 should buy you a good fan </s>
<s> 15 to 25 will get you one at your local parts store </s>
<s> as part of this group find it rather wandering to answer </s>
<s> perhaps because have house and agenda full of things to do and go to </s>
<s> or perhaps when find time to be on go thru several spam emails offering me mils to comply or the various fantasy teams i try to vie for somepart of a top 10 </s>
<s> or perhaps the several sites i try to construct and find several to be delinquent on updates due these and other reasons </s>
<s> or perhaps think of it and just get lost on right approach and find perhaps adding that memory board might be needed just to find they must be done in double issue </s>
<s> hmmm </s>
<s> rather tough question here but perhaps the placement of tower is considerably tough to get to </s>
<s> dust bunnies aren t allowed </s>
<s> if they aren t allowed and you bend just this once they ll take advantage of you don t let them in in the first place be firm but gentle </s>
<s> that s why i ve never had them thank you </s>
<s> if you go to the dollar store you can buy many colored dish cleaners that are matted and thin these are open enough even to breathe </s>
<s> they can easily be placed in front of any opening with no problem i even use these with a covering of charcoal fiber and place in oven fan and filter fan in bathroom </s>
<s> they are wonderful and thick enough to stop many small particles of stuff </s>
<s> do it </s>
<s> dust bunnies are not allowed so just exactly how do you accomplish something that nasa certified cleanrooms are not able to accomplish with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and very very strict control over access and egress </s>
<s> dust exists everywhere if a live mamal has been there dust is there </s>
<s> i rarely go more than a year or so without updating something or other on my computer </s>
<s> after a year in my computer environment the insides look quot pretty good quot but i usually blow fan blades and general interior areas clear of dust because there might be a harmful accumulation before i have occasion to open the case again </s>
<s> sometimes i have a tight build up right on the leading edges of the fan blades which i scrape loose with a toothpick prior to blowing out </s>
<s> i do not use unrestricted typical quot air compressor pressures quot 125 to 175 psi </s>
<s> something like about 35 psi nozzle pressure is a good pressure </s>
<s> you do want to do this outdoors too </s>
<s> i see a lot of people recommend vacuum cleaners for this cleaning operation but i have not found them to be effective in removing the caked on dirt </s>
<s> one note to those who have never seen a fan blade separate from excessive speed do not i repeat do not place an air nozzle real close to a fan blade and try to see how fast you can make it spin </s>
<s> hold the fan blade from spinning with a popsicle stick or similar item while blowing compressed air on it </s>
<s> invest in a whole house air purifier </s>
<s> my first computer i had a lot of trouble with the monitor collecting dust and i would have to wipe the moniter clean every couple of days </s>
<s> i purchased an oreck air purifier and neven had to clean the moniter from dust again </s>
<s> air purifiers work </s>
<s> i clean my computer when i have it open for some other reason </s>
<s> i like to play with it so that seems to average once every 4 or five months and that is more than enough </s>
<s> our house seems to be dustier than average but i keep the area around the computer clean </s>
<s> you can purchase vacuums and compressors made specifically for electronics but for occasional use the cans of compressed air are a lot cheaper and work just fine </s>
<s> if you have some especially tenacious dust try loosening it gently with a soft paintbrush </s>
<s> using household or shop vacuums is hazardous because of static and also the physical hazard of using the large awkward hoses and attachments that come with them </s>
<s> using a compressor that was designed for shop industrial use is also quite dangerous for electronics </s>
<s> these compressors can spit quite a lot of water and rust and debris from the tank and hose come out at very high speed </s>
<s> even at 30 psi you are applying more force per area than if you were standing on your motherboard on one foot </s>
<s> 8 00 for a can of air seems like a lot but it s a lot cheaper than a broken computer </s>
<s> if you don t have or can t get the right tools to do the job you should probably either leave it or else hire a professional to do it for you </s>
<s> i have a thermantake xaser3 tower full of goodies </s>
<s> i clean the case fan filters every three months and when i crack the case i check for anything that has happened to get inside </s>
<s> i do a detail check of the innards once a year but dust accumulation hasn t been an issue with this case </s>
<s> i have serviced other machines including laptops that have been a very different story </s>
<s> i use canned air and a basting tool and occasionally plastic tweezers on those ones to get them clean </s>
<s> keep it clean and cool and keep it alive </s>
<s> ok i have a plexiglas side and when i see furry critters enjoying the coolness of my fans which i might add are not shy to reproduce as soon as they can i go into quot operation straw quot yes ive tried compressed air canisters but the liquid ice worries me more than the fuzz balls so with just a thought i took a soda fountain straw and blew first into my video card fan and dudes i couldn t believe the chunks of built up fuzz i blew out then i removed my cpu fan heatsink repeated the straw procedure and i still don t know how much dust and fuzzy material can claim such a small area and not be noticed </s>
<s> that said i disassembled the psu casing and eek that s the mother ship for the reproduction of its fuzz invasion tactics i strawed them to their nonexistence smokers you may need to use caution as it takes a long hard exhale to make the straw a powerful force to rid the components of said fuzz fod and lots if dust </s>
<s> goodluck quot bravo quot </s>
<s> that is clogging the cooling fins i take it in to work and blast it with 8 atm </s>
<s> 140psi of air shame on me jonah </s>
<s> because it s a laptop </s>
<s> any service tech will tell you the number one problem found in laptops is overheating due to accumulation of dust </s>
<s> cut one or two 120mm holes in the floor of your box </s>
<s> screw the box to a two or three inch tall wood frame the same size as case </s>
<s> add casters the biggest auto air filter you can fit on the underside of the frame and up firing fans </s>
<s> had to spot cool the northbridge and memory </s>
<s> block exhaust except where it can help cool something like front panel holes around dvd drives etc </s>
<s> with no exhaust fan running a positive pressure of cool filtered air will fill the box as long as the system fan lead is hot </s>
<s> by the way i use duct tape and weatherstrip foam to mount fans no reason to obcess when tape works great </s>
<s> if you haven t opened the computer and are sucking dust out of obvious filters a vacuum cleaner is fine </s>
<s> if you have opened the computer then instead of squeezing into all the corners with the kenny everedge krevice nozzle use a small clean new paint brush to delicately flick the dust in the direction of the vacuum hose </s>
<s> dust is usually not a problem for me because i m switching boxes and boards so often the dust has no chance to settle </s>
<s> one thing that should be maintained for cleanliness is any keyboard that rates in quality higher than quot disposable quot </s>
<s> if you re getting by with a 101 keyboard that doesn t have those pesky windows keys and is made with real switches as opposed to a 6 dish sponge that doesn t let anyone build up a decent typing speed you have a duty to keep it clean </s>
<s> if your computer is in a smoking household no cigarette within 10 feet of the computer </s>
<s> i can make a small fortune recovering typist quality keyboards that have been filled with cigarette ash </s>
<s> don t be afraid to run the normal vacuum over the top not one of those usb things </s>
<s> if that suction is enough to lift keytops off your keyboard either it s clinically dead or you re using a karcher </s>
<s> i made the mistake of not making it clear once </s>
<s> if you can remove 99 of the dust in a half hour don t spend an additional 7 8 or 12 hours trying to get out the last 1 </s>
<s> i had one friend who had his computer shut down for a couple of days while he attempted to get out every little particle of dust </s>
<s> i had to come and reassemble his computer for him because he thought that any dust was a problem </s>
<s> i was sure that within a few weeks it would accumulate more dust than was left after the first half hour of cleaning </s>
<s> dust is a huge problem for me as i live in an agricultural part of australia </s>
<s> airborne pesticides sorghum cotton dust as well as animal hair cause me to use compressed air crc co contact cleaner and cleaning fan blades with alcohol soaked qtips at least monthly </s>
<s> the idea of fittinga house air filter is looking very good but costly </s>
<s> i sucked up two keyboard keys with a vacuum about a week ago </s>
<s> my vacuum cleaner is installed into the house so maybe because it was too powerful </s>
<s> my keyboard is fairly strong so i don t think its that </s>
<s> the keys i sucked up are screen lock and print screen luckily i don t use these that often and they were from my secondary keyboard </s>
<s> if i was to do it again i would put on the corner nozzle which is not big enough to let keys in </s>
<s> i clean once every few months when i open my computer to add more parts </s>
<s> sometimes i just want to look inside because i am bored and end up cleaning it i clean it with a cloth most of the time </s>
<s> i would never put a vacuum cleaner in their unless if it was one of those keyboard ones because i am scared of it damaging the computer </s>
<s> there is normaly a little bit of dust bunnies but not much </s>
<s> most of the dust is on the fans and on the grills </s>
<s> my cpu runs hot </s>
<s> these means that my system needs extra attention with cleaning and cooling </s>
<s> this problem also leads to extra fan noise </s>
<s> for some time i was quot three in one tm quot oiling them </s>
<s> currently i use a combination of 50 vaseline tm 50 graphite this seams to be working well and has reduced the frequency of this additional maintenance task and the noise </s>
<s> the graphite quot might quot keep the bearing cooler </s>
<s> a cooler bearing will last longer </s>
<s> if you consider adding this task to your routine maintenance these bearings can be accessed by removing the label or rubber plastic plug on the back of your fans </s>
<s> make sure you put the fan back on the way it came off </s>
<s> if the label can not be reapplied use tape to cover the bearing </s>
<s> duct tape works well </s>
<s> last week my sony pc started re booting itself every 10 15 minutes </s>
<s> very annoying it is about 4 years old and i ve never had it apart </s>
<s> knew it needed to be done but was procrastinating </s>
<s> so i bit the bullet and pulled it apart and boy was it nasty </s>
<s> cleaned it out with vacuum cleaner dustbuster and compressed air </s>
<s> be careful if you aim the air can downwards water may come out </s>
<s> not nice for your electronics </s>
<s> i used an old toothbrush and flicked the dust out where the vacuum could grab it </s>
<s> while apart i powered it up just long enough to verify that both the rear fan and the processor fan were running up to speed the fins between the fan and processor were really clogged up and was probably the cause of my problem </s>
<s> no problems since </s>
