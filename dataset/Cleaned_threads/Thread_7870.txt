<s> anybody run across this </s>
<s> i have four computers all operating from a home router </s>
<s> all have the same windows 2000 and network configuration </s>
<s> they can all quot talk quot to each other browse or map a drive except for one </s>
<s> this one will map to the other computers but the other computers cannot map to this one </s>
<s> attempts just say network path not found or something like that </s>
<s> whenever the other 3 computers have connection issues rebooting one of them usually solves it </s>
<s> not this one </s>
<s> i ve looked at all the network configs and can t see any difference </s>
<s> this one computer does have one other network issue </s>
<s> it can t connect to a dialup isp </s>
<s> gets some protocol missing error </s>
<s> i tried deleting and reinstalling the tcp stack but that caused worse problems and had to restore the whole system </s>
<s> all these machines are different hardware but identical os s and windows updates </s>
<s> my last resort is a clean install which i m not looking forward to </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> read bob </s>
<s> well none of the quot fixes quot had any effect </s>
<s> i could have sworn connecting to this machine worked at one time </s>
<s> although none of the other machines have a recently used map to this machine </s>
<s> i probably just need to reload anyway </s>
<s> it s been a while </s>
<s> i just hate getting everything back the way i want it </s>
<s> it s such a pain </s>
<s> i ve been debating going to xp anyway </s>
<s> but the thought of quot registering quot with ms galls me </s>
<s> milo </s>
