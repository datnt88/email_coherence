<s> in the same room is my cable modem which is running to a netgear wireless router </s>
<s> i only have 1 coaxline coming in </s>
<s> how should i rig this up </s>

<s> incidentally my desktop will not be wirelessly connected so if a surge hits my modem it can get to my router and them into my new system </s>
<s> can i input the coax into the sp and then spit it coming out </s>
<s> what do i do </s>
<s> can i utilize the ethernet protection on the sp for this </s>
<s> 2 several of the sps on the market have telephone line splitters </s>
<s> are there any sps that have coax splitters </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> the usa telco and cable companies already have great protection on those lines </s>
<s> what country are you in that you would add even more protection </s>
<s> yes there are splitters </s>
<s> i do not know what the name of it is </s>

<s> if i were you i would just buy two identical surge protectors a k a </s>

<s> i guess i could draw a map of what i think something like this would look like but i won t </s>
