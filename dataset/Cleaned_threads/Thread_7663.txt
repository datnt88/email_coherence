<s> i have had a dell inspiron 1300 notebook for almost a year which i primarily use to surf the web and send and receive emails </s>
<s> a few days ago i purchased quicken basic 2007 and installed it on the notebook </s>
<s> at the end of the day when i close out my quicken i m prompted to back up my data </s>
<s> i haven t backed it up yet but would like to do so </s>
<s> on an old desktop pc i used floppies to back up my quicken data </s>
<s> this dell notebook doesn t have a floppy drive but i could buy an external floppy drive to use to back up the quicken data but are there other ways available to back up the data </s>
<s> easier less expensive ways to back up the data </s>

<s> nobody is willing to offer me any advice on how best to go about backing up quicken data or any data on a notebook </s>
<s> if this isn t the correct forum to post such a question advise which forum is </s>
<s> i guess i should post this one in the quot computer newbies quot forum </s>

<s> hi searched the forum and found your old question regarding quicken 2007 </s>
<s> how did you make out with that </s>
<s> i have xp so needless to say i have learned the hard way that simply backing up on a cd like we did in the old days by selecting a drive and backing up on a floppy just isn t possible </s>
<s> according to microsoft in order for quicken to write a back up file directly to the cd r or cd rw the compact disc must first be formatted and support packet writing </s>
<s> the windows xp cd recording program does not support packet writing and does not contain a feature to format a recordable cd </s>
<s> so i have an external hard drive backing it up but i still long for a way to format the re writable cd s </s>
<s> i know some people are using a staging area saving method which again is just too complicated </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks archer </s>
