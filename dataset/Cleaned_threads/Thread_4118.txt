<s> my buisness has 8 hardwired computers 2 wireless computers and a server to connect together </s>
<s> currently we have an 8 port switch netgear g5608 and a wireless access point netgear wg602 v3 to connect all together </s>
<s> does anyone have any suggestions for an update to these two </s>
<s> i m trying to combine it all into one making it easier to maintain </s>
<s> modem gt router gt switch gt computers </s>
<s> the router must be in front of the switch as the router assigns ip addresses to each device </s>
<s> the wireless devices communicate with the router </s>
<s> run the network setup wizard on each machine and turn on file and printer sharing on all devices </s>
<s> assign a network name to be used by all devices </s>
<s> use wpa 2 for your wireless security </s>
<s> done </s>
<s> from the description wouldn t simply getting a router with the necessary lan ports and a wireless capability be easier </s>
<s> then configure the router as a bridge switch </s>
<s> it sounds from the description as though the server is a dhcp server and could also be a file server </s>
<s> there isn t enough information yet to make a real suggestion </s>
<s> we have a modem gt coolpix firewall gt file dhcp server gt netgear g5608 switch gt netgear wg602 v3 access point is there a router with 8 ports and wireless </s>
<s> after checking around there doesn t seem to be any wired wireless combination with 8 ports </s>
<s> 5 ports yes but none with 8 you seem to have the optimal hardware setup </s>
<s> ok thanks </s>
