<s> i just replaced my motherboard with a used one of the same make model chipset so bootup was quite easy </s>
<s> however there s one problem my floppy a drive isn t recognized </s>
<s> it doesn t light on startup and isn t shown in windows explorer </s>
<s> os is win98se </s>
<s> i m sure one possible reason for this is a damaged defective motherboard but am hopeful there s another less drastic cause </s>
<s> can someone please give me some insight as to what s causing this </s>
<s> also am i correct in my understanding that the red stripe on the ide ribbon cable goes to the outboard side of the floppy drive </s>
<s> my fd connector has alignment slots on both top and bottom so i want to verify that i ve installed the cable correctly </s>
<s> if the drive worked before look at the ribbon cable the motherboard and the drive itself </s>
<s> all have pin 1 configuration marks </s>
<s> make sure the red mark on the ribbon pin 1 goes to pin 1 on the motherboard </s>
<s> some floppies do not have the mark so try the cable both ways </s>
<s> if this doesn t work try a new cable </s>
<s> a look in the bios is called for to see if the drive is set to 31 2 inch 1 44mb capacity </s>
