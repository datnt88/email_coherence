<s> firstly hi to all first post on here </s>
<s> i have just taken delivery of a 40gb external hdd for my laptop i have included a link to the model if it helps anyone i use an acer aspire 30003lc xp sp2 my problem is that when ever i unplug i get and audible tone and then plug back in the quot hardware wizard quot opens and says that it detects new hardware and asks me to install the software for it </s>
<s> i had a drivers disk send with it and installed what files were on it but nothing has changed when i emailed the sellers they said that it is plug and play and i dont need drivers for it </s>
<s> so why send me a disk with drivers then </s>
<s> but i had to install them to even make my laptop find the device in the first place i have taken the drive to a friends today and plugged in into his desktop and it worked perfectly straight away no drivers to install as it should be can anyone offer my any advice as to why my laptop detects it as quot new hardware quot everytime i plug it in i look forward to any help or advice on offer cheers froggy </s>
<s> i ve used these usb powered drives and after 2 of my own and dozens at the office i can share that they are finicky </s>
<s> you ll find they work only on some machines some but not all usb 2 0 ports and the cure is to get a power supply for the unit </s>
<s> i ve had some luck with a 2 to 1 usb cable where it connects to 2 laptop usb ports to eek a little more power </s>
<s> one of my units uses what i thought at first was a standard a b usb cable </s>
<s> but later i figured out that it s cable was quot special quot how </s>
<s> the wires that carry power were double the normal thickness </s>
<s> nothing s busted here except your device does not work on all setups </s>
<s> here s the cable i would try gt read paragraph 4 at bob </s>
<s> hi bob thanks for the reply i have my laptop permanantly plugged in to the mains power battery has gone so would that not mean that it would get enough power as it is wired to the mains supply not the battery </s>
<s> froggy </s>
<s> you didn t tell how it was getting power </s>
<s> if by usb then what i wrote applies </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for your help one other thing as i said when ever i plug it in the hardware wizard opens i just say no to searching for software and close down the other wizard prompts then i can use the drive perfectly but in doing that every time will it harm the drive in any way </s>
<s> and should i use the quot safely remove hardware quot button before i unplug it </s>
<s> sorry to be a pain rob </s>
<s> likely none to the drive it is possible to lose files or the drive content but that s not harming the drive </s>
<s> as to what works and not the lesson here is to go with what works </s>
<s> i think we ve covered that usb powered drives are finicky </s>
