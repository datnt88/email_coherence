<s> recently decided to build my own pc and after tinkering and connecting all the components it was up and running properly </s>
<s> i put in a second hardrive and it was still ok although i hadnt yet begun installing my os </s>
<s> i tried startin it 2day to install the os but it just showed me a blank black screen </s>
<s> everything inside is visually functioning properly the fan etc but the cd rom drive doesnt even open </s>
<s> im thinkin it mite be static on the motherboard and i pray it aint but there hasnt been any shocks between me and the comp </s>
<s> infact i left it in good working order but when i returned it wasnt </s>
<s> i also left it with the case open is there a way i can tinker with the mother board to make it 4get it was on strike and start again </s>
<s> ive already tried to reset it with the cmos pins </s>
<s> have you determined if the hard drive is spinning up </s>
<s> try listening close to the unit for signs that the hard drive is powering and or watch for the front indicator light </s>
<s> the problem sounds as though it may be related to the power supply </s>
<s> did the power supply come with a new case that you bought for this build </s>
<s> if so that may be the culprit </s>
<s> these quot oem quot power supplies are not the best thing to run your computer on </s>
<s> they re mass produced and i ve seen many a power supply come with some mid tower fry in the first twelve hours </s>
<s> the manufacturing tolerance and testing on them is not the greatest </s>
<s> make sure there is at least one brass motherboard riser to ground the board properly hmmm what else is it posting ok </s>
<s> or beeping more than one short beep </s>
<s> what s the motherboard brand name </s>
<s> did you try pulling out and reseating the cards video sound ram whatever you have in there </s>
<s> i know a million and one questions but that symptom could be so many things </s>
<s> success </s>
<s> i did what you said and reseated all my cards infact i took the darn thing apart and put it together </s>
<s> turned it on inserted floppy disk 1 of 6 to allow me to install xp from cd rom </s>
<s> after a long proccess of inserting disk after disk i was greeted with the very welcomed setup page </s>
<s> it sed press enter to install win xp had another option for recovery and another for quitting </s>
<s> i proceeded to press enter but nothing happened all over sudden my keyboard had failed </s>
<s> ive tried another keyboard that works but nothing </s>
<s> what i dont understand is why it allowed me to get thru the setup process then cut me off </s>
<s> when i turn the comp again the keyboard works properly </s>
<s> these are my basic hardware specs atx 400w power athlon xp 2400 6 gig hdd 256mb ddr 266mhz 2004 rz athlon xp series motherboard </s>
<s> you must be kidding </s>
<s> it couldn t be new so maybe that s your problem and it s probably faulty and definately undersize </s>
<s> buy a new minimum 20gig hdd as they are very cheap </s>
<s> persanally i would install an 80 gig hdd to give me room for files </s>
<s> mp3s for example </s>
<s> you do have a network connection don t you </s>
<s> windows needs to quot call home quot to complete installation </s>
<s> you must have an installed modem with a phone connection if you do not already have a broadband isp already set up with the cable or dsl modem installed </s>
<s> ait ill get an 80 gig hdd with my next pay </s>
<s> i dont have an internal modem coz i decided to buy a bt voyager 105 modem from aol instead </s>
<s> i can remove a dial up modem from this pc so thats not a problem </s>
<s> i really do appreciate your help and look foward to coming bak here wen my new hdd decides to start running circles around me </s>
<s> looks like i was thinking way too much about the power instead of simply buyin the right equipment </s>
<s> hey you do not need a modem to complete the installation of windows xp </s>
<s> you do not need to be hooked up to the internet at all </s>
<s> it will ask you and you just say later </s>
<s> to be hoenst i do not think that it is the hdd xp only needs 1 5gb for the installation </s>
<s> i do recommend getting a larger hdd before continuing though </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> yes he is correct you do not need to contact microsoft to finish the instalation but there is a problem with the hdd the size is not any concern here however the speed might be causing the problem standard hdd s run at 7200 rpm s and older ones run at 5600 i belive if the hard drive is running slower than this there might be some communication issues while trying to write to the hdd at the very least it will take a long time to install and will cause bottlenecking durring bootup and many other critical times also with that small of a hdd it has got to be reaching about 7 10 years old roughly which exeeds the expected lifetime of a hdd from that era even if it was not a faulty hdd i would highly reccomend replacing it let us know how things turn out </s>
<s> bought a cheap 20 gig drive and my computer finally started singing in tune </s>
<s> thanx alot for ur help ppl </s>
<s> mucho apreaciated </s>
<s> infact im typin this from the ex troubled computer </s>
<s> next i have my sights set on a sweet 160 gig if im gonna buy space mite as well buy space good </s>
<s> on sale today at circuit city for 40 after rebates </s>
