<s> i plan to buy a new notebook within a couple of months either a pc or a macbook pro that s another story i ve used pc s for almost 20 years but am looking into the macs </s>
<s> my question concerns processors </s>

<s> the only difference is the processors 1 amd turion 64 x2 dual core tl 60 2 0ghz 1mb or 2 intel core 2 duo t7200 2 0ghz 4mb l2 cache </s>
<s> what kind of difference would i notice between the two processors </s>
<s> the amd computer would be 90 cheaper but the processor has only 1mb of cache while the intel has 4mb </s>
<s> how much does that affect speed </s>
<s> or could i save even more by stepping down to a slower processor </s>
<s> for instance the amd dual core tl 56 1 8ghz 1mb would be 75 less than the amd dual core tl 60 2 0ghz 1mb </s>
<s> the intel core 2 duo t5600 1 83ghz 2mb l2 cache would be 100 less than the intel core 2 duo t7200 2 0ghz 4mb l2 cache </s>
<s> i thought i had read somewhere that the amd turion dual core chips had fallen behind the intel core 2 duo chips </s>
<s> because i tend to keep my notebooks for several years my present hp is four years old i want the get the fastest processor practicable </s>
<s> btw i asked this in the laptops forum and have not had a reply as of now </s>
<s> i really appreciate any input </s>
<s> thanks bill </s>
<s> short answer </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob can you give a wee bit longer answer as in quot why quot is the intel faster cooler just like the name etc </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> bill </s>
<s> writes quot the core 2 duo outperforms amd s athlon 64 x2 clock for clock in most benchmarks and it even consumes less energy than amd s offerings quot so that in a nutshell is why i d get that </s>
<s> besides the stability and standard bearer intel is </s>
<s> my next machine is a core 2 duo machine so power is a concern </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> will be amd </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> get what you are comfortable with </s>
<s> the line between the momentary victory for either one will change hands shortly </s>
<s> that is what the game is all about </s>
<s> either one will serve you well </s>
<s> some softwares will not support the new core configurations yet so check that out also </s>
<s> i read recently in pc magazine that amd is challenging the power consumption measurement techniques that show amd to have higher usage </s>
<s> let s say the power comsumption isn t an issue </s>
<s> let s say that quot clock for clock quot intel beats the amd </s>
<s> but what about quot dollar per dollar quot </s>
<s> if the amd machine is around 100 less you can get a faster amd processor which is what should be used in any comparison </s>
<s> pick a formula and weigh it that way </s>
<s> in fact why not tell us what you found </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i did a quick look at hp and a 1 8 intel was about 20 more than a 2ghz amd all else being equal </s>
<s> i ll take time later to paste the configuration </s>
<s> it would be a shame to see time on battery power to take a hit for 20 bucks </s>
<s> also you can check with tomshardware com s mother of all cpu charts to see if you lowered the core 2 duo clock rate enough to match the 2 cpus </s>

<s> the summary benchmark of the australian pc site was 95 5 for intel 1 8 and 96 for amd 2 0 i will have to do a lot more study to be sure which i want but i have until july or august to decide when my son goes to college </s>
<s> i don t think you can go wrong with either one and it will come down to price eventually for me </s>
<s> i have read that the amd x2 dual cores produce significantly more heat than the comparable intels </s>
<s> has your research found anything which confirms or contradicts that </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> bill you are making this harder on yourself than necessary </s>
<s> if one cpu brand is a lemon versus the other the market would have killed it by now </s>
<s> since they are both still around figure that people are buying one or the other </s>
<s> besides the cpu isn t the only factor in performance or fan speed or usability </s>
<s> aside from gaming all new notebooks today are sufficient to satisfy users immediate and foreseeable forthcoming needs </s>
<s> you won t be able to buy a machine today that can outperform even the low end of a series 4 years from now </s>
<s> instead of shopping by specs go to a store and quot play quot with the laptops </s>
<s> any best buy circuit city compusa or dell direct outlet will let you to that </s>
<s> if one manufacturer has both the intel and amd in similar size screen that is an even better comparison </s>
<s> after playing pick the one you like best </s>
<s> you won t have buyer s remorse </s>
<s> guaranteed </s>
<s> certain processors are slightly better at certain tasks such as video editing gaming or productivity </s>
<s> bob i believe that you stated a comparison between the athalon 64 x2 and the core 2 duo </s>
<s> when in fact amd is now offering the turion 64 x2 which runs faster cooler and is more energy efficient </s>
