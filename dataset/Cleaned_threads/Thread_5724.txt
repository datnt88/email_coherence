<s> probably you can t do this without the cooperation of your it staff </s>
<s> they will have to open ports on the firewall or install vpn software or whatever security measures they think necessary </s>
<s> so let them determine the software to be used also </s>
<s> the best way by the way is to not use any local software </s>
<s> if all your applications are webbased like gmail google docs and salesforce com there s no difference at all between working here or working there </s>
<s> just log in from whereever you happen to be </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> the best would be what your it staff installs and helps you maintain </s>
<s> laptops usually are poor choices for 24x7 operation as a server but your it staffer can make this happen and that would be the best solution </s>
