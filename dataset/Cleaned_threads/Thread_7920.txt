<s> hi all my cousin and i want to establish a vlan of sorts over the internet to collaborate over files and applications installed in each other s laptop </s>
<s> what would be the easiest and cheapest way to go about doing this </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> and with many offerings of quot your own cloud quot why not that since i find most folk that ask this blow apart and any vpn vlan setup </s>
<s> most get really upset you can t do it with just a router </s>

<s> hi you can use team viewer for file sharing and screen sharing otherwise to make a vpn either you have to buy dyndns services for connection of vpn if you are planning on using dynamic ip s or else you need to request static ip from your respective isp s and then creating a vpn using network setup wizard from your pc windows </s>
<s> vlan however is entirely a different scope </s>
<s> regards david </s>
