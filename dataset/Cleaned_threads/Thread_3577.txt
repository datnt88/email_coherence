<s> i ve searched through various posts and other sites for reviews and tips on what tablet to get but i m still lost </s>
<s> i figured by posting here i d get a better idea of what i need </s>
<s> here s pretty much what i m looking for these are the most important requirements 1 i am looking for a tablet with no less than 8 9 quot screen </s>
<s> i looked at the google nexus 7 and it seems great but the screen is too small for what i m looking to do </s>
<s> 2 i will be using the tablet for business while on travel so i d like it to be able to open office documents mostly word excel and power point </s>
<s> i don t care if i have to pay to get an app that will do this </s>
<s> i just need to have the capability </s>
<s> 3 i d like decent battery life </s>
<s> i will be traveling a bit and if i m taking a flight from coast to coast i d like to be able to watch a full length movie without the battery dying </s>
<s> 4 it needs to have a reliable wi fi signal </s>
<s> 5 i d like to watch movies with good video resolution </s>
<s> 6 the device doesn t need to have a lot of storage space but it does need to have the capability to access services like google drive or some kind of online file storage </s>
<s> i typically have a lot of smaller files on a usb thumb drive that i carry with me but i know most tablets don t have the capability to read them </s>
<s> so regardless of what tablet i get i m prepared to make the switch to using some sort of online file storage service to access my files </s>
<s> 7 the typing and note taking needs to be smooth </s>
<s> i currently have a motorola razr phone and i use evernote and a couple other note taking apps </s>
<s> the typing is very sluggish and it s pretty annoying </s>
<s> if i m going to be using a tablet for typing i want the response time to be as if i m typing on a computer </s>
<s> 8 the tablet should have the option for an external keyboard whether it s connected directly or via bluetooth doesn t matter to me </s>
<s> 9 i will be browsing the internet with the tablet </s>
<s> i ve heard the ipad doesn t support flash but i m not sure how big of a problem that will be for me </s>
<s> i do watch youtube videos and also show video files for business presentations </s>
<s> the videos are mostly avi mpeg wmv mov etc </s>
<s> 10 i d like to switch my current magazine subscriptions like popular science forbes etc so i can view them on the tablet </s>
<s> the tablet needs to have some way of viewing these </s>
<s> 11 i d like to store and view photos </s>
<s> mostly jpg 12 processor speed since i will be multitasking i d like seamless transition between opening apps etc </s>
<s> somewhat important but not a deal breaker 1 it d be nice if there was a way to hook up a usb thumb drive or an external hard drive to the device </s>
<s> whether or not it s a direct connect or maybe a wireless hard drive it doesn t matter to me </s>
<s> 2 it d be nice to multi task </s>
<s> i like how you can view several files at once with the samsung galaxy devices </s>
<s> things that don t matter 1 the speakers don t have to be great </s>
<s> if i m going to listen to music with this device it ll be with headphones or hooking up some external speakers </s>
<s> so the sound quality doesn t need to be fantastic </s>
<s> in regards to price i m willing to pay somewhere between 400 500 dollars </s>
<s> i keep hearing that the ipad is the best tablet but i really have no idea if it s the best for what i need </s>
<s> since there are countless android tablets i don t know enough about them either </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> that s the only known system that hits all your marks </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> while there are loyal android users i don t know any that have also used apple devices it seems once an apple user always an apple user </s>
<s> after looking through your list it seems like an ipad is the way to go </s>
<s> imo if you go with something else you re either going to disappointed or you re not going to be aware of what you re missing </s>
<s> make sure you pick up a nice solid case for your new tablet too </s>
<s> cheers chase </s>
<s> when that happens then a big item in their list will be covered </s>
<s> for now the few that demand full word and excel compatibility get to look at windows 7 8 9 pro tablets </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> why do you think the ipad is better in this case </s>
<s> the only apple device i have is an ipod </s>
<s> my phone runs android and i m pretty used to the google products </s>
<s> the only thing i dislike about my android phone is it s inability to keep up with my typing </s>
<s> i purchased an ipad 3 for my dad this weekend and had a chance to look at it </s>
<s> it seems pretty simple and easy to figure out which is nice </s>
<s> but i ve read that they can t be customized like the android tablets can </s>
<s> the one thing i like about some of the asus tablets is the ability to dock with an external keyboard which has usb and memory card expansion </s>
<s> that s kind of a nice feature </s>
<s> does the ipad have that capability </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> but it fails some items on your list </s>
<s> it could be you were spec happy and didn t really mean what you wrote but i m left to guess </s>
<s> as to the customizing of one tablet over the over the windows 8 pro tablet wins that round </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> which particular items on the list doesn t it meet </s>
<s> i think the windows 8 pro tablet will be outside of my price range </s>
<s> also someone at work has the asus tablet with windows rt and hasn t had a lot of great things to say about it </s>
<s> the hardware is nice but they said that windows rt is pretty limited </s>
<s> so i m somewhat skeptical about the windows tablets </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i have the asus model and almost all documents open </s>
<s> we have a few that didn t and for that we re back to a windows laptop or tablet </s>
<s> frankly windows 8 rt is so restrictive that we can t go near that at the office </s>
<s> lighten up microsoft and maybe we ll look at it again </s>
<s> windows 8 rt is nice that you get office </s>
<s> these tablets are not cheaper than a laptop so i wonder why you are looking at them </s>
<s> what s the attraction </s>
<s> lists out the tablet and dock for just under 1 000 bob </s>
