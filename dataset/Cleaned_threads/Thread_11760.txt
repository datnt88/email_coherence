<s> i have two cd dvd burners on my pavilion xv998 </s>
<s> every time i try to add data music to a cd that has something on it i get an message that says to quot insert a blank disk quot </s>
<s> this happens no matter how much space is left on the cd </s>
<s> i just can not write anything to a cd dvd that has anything on it </s>
<s> this applies to rw s as well as r s </s>
<s> with the rw s it will allow me to erase whatever is on the disk and then it will record but if i try to put anything else on the disk it will tell me that there isn t room even though it has 600gbs left </s>
<s> and occurs no matter what software i am using to write with </s>
<s> i have several cd dvd burning applications and it happens on all of them </s>
<s> has anyone else experienced this </s>
<s> can anyone explain what to do about it </s>
<s> can it be a hardware or software problem </s>
<s> tells you more than you need to know </s>
<s> read about multi session and be aware that cd audio disks are not going to allow this if on cd r and only if you erase the disk if on cd r w </s>
<s> in short nothing seems wrong </s>

<s> thanks for the info </s>
<s> but i can add to a partially completed cd on my other computer if there is sufficient space </s>
<s> it asks me if i wish to erase on an rw and when i reply quot no quot it allows adding data or music </s>
<s> the computer that won t allow adding to a partially filled disk has lots of dvd cd burning software on it so there may be a conflict somewhere </s>
<s> that s a mult session cd </s>
<s> just so you know cd audio has no such method </s>
<s> be clear on your terminology and use the cdr faq to get up to speed on what is what </s>
<s> i don t see any issue yet </s>
<s> things seem to be working just fine </s>
