<s> hi all i searched thru the existing posts relating to wireless networking but couldn t find a fix that matches my situation so i thought i d ask some of the intelligent people here </s>
<s> i ll keep the post short to save you some reading vaio laptop 2002 windows xp netgear wireless card netgear mr814v2 router b only synopsis this network b t the router card and pc has worked fine for 4 years or so </s>
<s> recently i started getting the dreaded quot 404 quot page </s>
<s> the network connection icon in the tray says the card to router is connected and excellent signal strength </s>
<s> no matter what settings you choose it will not connect </s>
<s> i even went so far as to reload the system restore discs hoping any wrong check boxes made would be restored to the connection i could make before nothing </s>
<s> even after restoring the system and wiping everything out it still does the same thing </s>
<s> connection status shows it is fine but will not load any web page </s>
<s> oh the network does have wep and the key is being entered correctly and accepted on the pc </s>
<s> not sure if it matters but the ssid is broadcasted </s>
<s> p s i have 2 other laptops in the house both newer with internal wireless and both connect to that quot b quot router just fine and load web pages pretty fast </s>
<s> any pointers anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> mike </s>
<s> that hardware does break down </s>
<s> i might try another network card first </s>
<s> and does this vaio laptop 2002 connect at free wifi hotspots </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> yes when wired driectly to the router it works fine </s>
<s> i don t take this laptop out so i m not sure if it will pick up other networks </s>
<s> it doesn t find any of my nieghbor s networks </s>
<s> if out of warranty you ll want to try some pc card since repairs costs so much </s>
<s> something new since the last post i clicked on repair the connection and after a long time of it trying i get an error message saying quot the following steps of the repair operation failed renewing the ip address </s>
<s> please contact your network administrator or isp quot </s>
<s> could this be the culprit </s>
<s> i just tried a linksys card i have and still nothing </s>
<s> but even if the hardware card card slot on pc has failed wouldn t it give me a quot no connection quot icon in the tray </s>
<s> i reloaded the netgear card software rebooted and reinserted the card while it was rebooting and same thing </s>
<s> it recognizes my network and another in the neighborhood and i can connect to mine using the network key </s>
<s> it connects and says the connection status is excellent but just will not load a web page </s>
<s> i m alomst certain there s something in the settings preventing it from connecting </s>
<s> the netgear software is controlling the connection and not windows so i know that setting is not a factor </s>
<s> thanks again r </s>
<s> that s a message i would expect if there is a problem with the card driver or even if you got the password wrong </s>
<s> a trip to a free wifi hotspot would be my next test </s>
