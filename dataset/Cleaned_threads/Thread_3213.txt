<s> hi before i start asking questions here is what i am currently working with 800 mhz powerpc g4 powermac4 5 no airport or any wireless hardware installed os 10 4 5 however to make things more complicated within the next month or so i will also be running a lenovo thinkpad laptop not exactly sure which model </s>
<s> my problem is i find it almost necessary to upgrade from my current comcast cable internet to wi fi </s>
<s> in the fall i will be going away to college and i ll be going back and forth between campus which has wi fi and my house </s>
<s> i will be doing all of my work on my laptop since my powermac will be staying home with my family while i live on campus so i need a convenient way to also work online here at home on my laptop </s>
<s> but i am completely clueless on how to </s>
<s> i ve read the forums and seen a lot of talk about airport </s>
<s> do i need to buy this </s>
<s> can t i just be like everyone else cough windowsusers cough and go to best buy and buy a wireless router </s>
<s> such as my point is i want to make this as easy as possible while still maintaining a decent connection between both computers </s>
<s> i could probably just unhook my mac from the cable modem and connect my laptop to it but i don t feel like doing that everyday i don t want to have to go through comcast tech support and software installation and i don t want to be stuck in my home office with no work space </s>
<s> sorry if i confused anyone but i really need help before i go out and purchase anything </s>
<s> any suggestions would be appreciated p s </s>
<s> whatever the solution may be i need to be able to access the internet from at least 1 story above where i am now </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> i am a bit confused of what do you really want to do with your network </s>
<s> but if i understood it correctly you have a mac laptop and you are also planning to buy a lenovo </s>
<s> there are wireless cards that both are compatible with a mac computer and a computer running through windows better look for those device </s>
<s> i bet linksys have one and it have drives for both mac and windows </s>
<s> 802 11g is a standard </s>
<s> ip is also a standard </s>
<s> as long as the mac and the thinkpad both support ip and 802 11g you should have no problems </s>
<s> skrall </s>
<s> yes if what we assume is correct and all you want to do is access you modem from either the pc mac or new laptop go buy a router anything should work since 802 11 g is the standard </s>
<s> do you have to buy an access point for the mac or is it wireless enable </s>
