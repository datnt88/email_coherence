<s> i was thinking about installing a radeon x1600 pro 512mb pci express video card </s>
<s> does anyone have this card or have first hand experience that knows how good the graphics are </s>
<s> i want to be able to play games like rome total war and the upcoming medieval total war 2 on high settings </s>
<s> or is there a better card that i should be looking at </s>
<s> i am getting a 400 watt power supply have a pentium 4 processor and not afraid of spending some money if it gets me what i want </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> or is there a better card that i should be looking at </s>
<s> nvidia 7600gt </s>
<s> the 512mb vram on the x1600pro doesn t make a difference in performance it s just for marketing </s>
<s> the 7600gt slaughters the x1600pro and the more expensive x1600xt </s>
<s> you can get an evga 7600gt for 135 on newegg </s>
<s> i am getting a 400 watt power supply what brand and model is that power supply </s>
<s> and not afraid of spending some money how much are you willing to spend </s>
<s> also what s the rest of your computer specs </s>
<s> i ordered a hp 400 watt micro atx power supply from hp </s>
<s> i m not sure of the model i would be willing to spend up to 300 if it is an outstanding video card yeah i know the best ones cost like 500 but i don t have the power supply for it what other specs would you need </s>
<s> i ordered a hp 400 watt micro atx power supply from hp </s>
<s> what are the amps on the 12v rail of that psu </s>
<s> the 12v rail powers the cpu video card motherboard and some other important stuff so you want to have at least 20a on the 12v rail </s>
<s> the more amps the more power that can be delivered to the devices that it s powering </s>
<s> ie if the psu has 10a on the 12v rail you multiply 10x12 and get 120 that means that 120 watts are available for all the devices powered by the 12v rail </s>
<s> a single high end video card can use more than 100 watts of power so you get the message </s>
<s> i contacted hp they said it has 1 5 amps on the 12v rail i m going to cancel that order </s>
<s> they also said that installing a psu with more than 1 5 amp would damage my mother board and that all hps are give 1 5 amps on the 12v rail </s>
<s> apparently it s impossible to upgrade my computer cause i ve been doing this for about 2 weeks and still nothing </s>
<s> 1 5 amps </s>
<s> whoever gave you that info must be wrong because you can t even run a computer with 1 5 amps on the 12v rail </s>
<s> my computer came from hp with a 300w power supply with 19a on the 12v rail </s>
<s> it was powering a pentium 4 one hard drive two dvd drives and a radeon x600 </s>
<s> hp gave you the wrong information don t cancel the order just look at the sticker on the psu when you receive it </s>
<s> did you upgrade your power suppy and or video card </s>
<s> i m having the most difficult time tracking down micro atx power supplies above 300 watts </s>
<s> hp is really starting to me off the keep giving me wrong info </s>
<s> is there any good graphics card that could just run on my current specs </s>
