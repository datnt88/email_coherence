<s> i have an hp pavilion 513n with a 1 8gig processor </s>
<s> previous to my problem the computer had been sitting for several weeks </s>
<s> i had taken the memory out and had not fully replaced it into the mobo slot </s>
<s> without realizing this i turned on the computer </s>
<s> it beeped a lot the power button light was on and the hd access light stayed on continuously </s>
<s> when i realized what i had done i unplugged the computer and replaced the memory solidly into the slot </s>
<s> since then when i boot it i get the screen message quot operating system not found quot when i go into setup it shows no primary master or slave drive </s>
<s> it shows my memory floppy drive and dvd rom as a secondary master correctly </s>
<s> the computer will boot from the floppy drive with a windows 98 boot disk </s>
<s> it runs programs from the floppy disk without problems </s>
<s> i have tried a different working hd </s>
<s> i can hear it running but the bios will not recognize it is there </s>
<s> i have switched cables </s>
<s> nothing i try has worked </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> try this </s>
<s> attach the hd and 80 conductor ide cable to the secondary ide channel </s>
<s> does it detect it </s>

<s> thanks for all the suggestions </s>
<s> i reset bios defaults without any success </s>
<s> i then disconnected the dvd rom and connected that cable to the hd </s>
<s> the computer booted fine </s>
<s> but then i took the cable in the primary slot and moved it to the secondary slot the one that the dvd rom was in </s>
<s> after this the computer would not boot again </s>
<s> in other words the cable was bad the whole time </s>
<s> once again thanks for the help </s>
