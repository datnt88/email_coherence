<s> hi all ok i have rcn s quot 10 quot speed internet a toshiba pcx 2500 cable modem a phone router from vonage and a wgr 614v6 wireless router wired in that order </s>
<s> here s the problem when there is a power failure doesn t happen often but </s>
<s> after the power comes back on the wireless connection on my laptop says the signal is there but it doesn t actually work </s>
<s> i have to recycle the modem routers one at a time in wired order to get things back to normal </s>
<s> is there a way to do something so i wouldn t have to do that in case the power goes off when i m not around and neighbors using the wifi can get on </s>
<s> also this pcx 2500 modem i pay 3 to rcn for it it s 2 years old at least is this thing up to date technology </s>
<s> thank you fj </s>
<s> at this point you should look at the smallest ups units you can find for those parts </s>
<s> since we are looking at such small power usage the ups may be the cheap cure </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s all part of the same reworking of the wifi setup but the power failure i thoguht was a different subject quesiotn hope that is ok i will look into the ups maybe there is a small one for those 3 itmes fj </s>
<s> yes there are power sequencers like but an ups is cheap </s>
<s> and here is cheaper than new routers or modems </s>
