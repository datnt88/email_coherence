<s> i m trying to get a usb mouse to work with a ps 2 to usb adapter since my usb ports all fail to work but it wont stay on </s>
<s> my ps 2 mouse is dead so i ve bought a cheap ps 2 to usb adapter off of amazon and plugged my usb mouse into it </s>
<s> upon system boot the mouse will turn on and then turn off after about two seconds </s>
<s> there s nothing i can do to turn it back on and it s being to get me annoyed </s>
<s> i know the mouse works fine since i just tried it on a netbook and it worked upon plug in </s>
<s> does anyone have advice to offer </s>
<s> not all usb mice can use such adapters </s>
<s> the mouse has to have the circuits to support ps2 as the adapter you noted rarely has more than wires </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i think they go for under 5 </s>
<s> i just got one from amazon to end this whole ordeal </s>
<s> unfortunately i ve hit another problem </s>
<s> the ps 2 mouse is now unresponsive when playing games </s>
<s> i was just in tf2 when the mouse wheel would act on it s own and then the entire mouse will not respond for thirty seconds after </s>
<s> not to mention how it will randomly stop responding mid turn in other games </s>
<s> it s a imicro mo 5013p ps 2 mouse </s>
<s> i was thinking of a driver update but the imicro site provides none </s>
<s> should i try the basic optical mouse drivers from microsoft </s>
