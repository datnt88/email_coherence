<s> i will be upgrading my g4 graphite 400mhz and g4 mdd dual 1 25ghz setup to the latest g5 dual 2ghz </s>
<s> please advise if and how i can 1 move the g4 graphite s stock internal hd to the g4 dual as 2nd hd </s>
<s> 2 move the g4 dual s stock internal hd to the new g5 dual as 2nd hd </s>
<s> 3 replace both g4 graphite s and g4 mdd s main internal hd </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> what is a g4 mdd </s>
<s> 1 make sure that the drive you are moving to the g4 dual is set to slave and make sure that the existing drive is set to master </s>
<s> connect it to the same ide cable as the original </s>
<s> the second drive sits above the original drive in a tray like device that is held in place by a single screw which is revealed when you disconnect the ide ribbon cable </s>
<s> 2 the g5 appears to only have internal connections for a serial ata drive not an ide ata drive </s>
<s> however you can purchase a firewire case for the drive if you wish to use it </s>
<s> 3 replacement drives for the g4 graphite and the g4 mdd assuming they are both towers and not some form of imac need to be ide ata drives commonly available at your local best buy circuit city or any electronics computer store of your choice </s>
<s> these drives are not mac specific so do not ask for a macintosh hard drive </s>
<s> hope this helps p </s>
<s> many thanks p for your much appreciated advice </s>
<s> g4 mdd is the mac powerpc with mirrored drive doors </s>
<s> it s reassuring to know that what i had in mind can be done </s>
<s> hope this reply reaches you </s>
<s> regards godfrey </s>
<s> mdd mirrored drive doors </s>
<s> duh </s>

<s> if i were you i would upgrade to os 10 4 2 tiger and use the migration assistant feature contained there to transfer the information using firewire target mode </s>
<s> it is easy and very intuitive </s>
<s> it may be easy but i don t see where you have addressed any of the questions asked </s>
<s> the aim was to move existing drives around and install them as second drives in other machines </s>
<s> obviously the data goes with them so no need to use migration assistant or firewire target mode </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> all good advice but if the g5 is anything like the g4 s it is very important to make sure that the quot master drive quot or the original drive in the g5 is the last in the chain or you will be in hell </s>
<s> so make sure the drive you are adding is set on slave connect it to the middle connector and then connect the master drive </s>
<s> because of ide cables that you may have to do this you may have to take the original drive out of the bottom bay and put the new drive in on the bottom then install the g4 drive above it </s>
<s> i know this sounds like a pain in the ass but it isn t much more work and results will be perfect </s>
<s> make sure that the blue end of the ide cable is connected to the mother board if it has one </s>
<s> you can connect both of the g4 cables if you want to purchase an ide pci card </s>
<s> then you can expand your machine to 2 extra drives just put them both on the same new bus </s>
<s> the g5 is nothing like the g4 </s>
<s> the g5 uses serial drives while the g4 uses ide drives </s>
<s> setting ide drives to cable select eliminates the problems you describe with the ide cable </s>
<s> it does not matter on a mac where the drives master or slave are located on the ide cable as the mac is capable of booting from either drive </s>
<s> it apparently matters on a pc though </s>
