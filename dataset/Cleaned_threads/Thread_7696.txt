<s> hi im shoppn for a new computer for me and my daughters this will be out first it will mainly be used for internet and music and dvd quot s i d like to stay around 1000 </s>
<s> to 1400 at the max the 2 companys so far that interest me is hp i ll get more specific models as i learn more any help will be grately appreciated thanks again </s>
<s> i also would like to add that i want my operating system to be windows xp and not vista been lookn at a hp m7659n m7690n both are about 300 more than the other withiout monitor but that s not a problem for my price range the only thing i did not like is that hp did not document well what was required to play hd dvds </s>
<s> the computer is fully capable but you must have a monitor that supports hdcp copy protection for hd discs so no hd dvd will play because of the copy protection and their are only a few monitors that support it 700 and up range </s>
<s> works fine if you use the analog output but then you loose the real hd experience </s>
<s> you can connect it toahdcp tv which all tvs with an hdmi import will support </s>
<s> pc has plenty of power </s>
<s> it doesn t record or play high def with a high def monitor </s>
<s> it isn t geared for that </s>
<s> confused as to why it will play the high def dvd s but not the high def channels </s>
<s> i m gonna make my decision this week as my daughters are gettn impatient lol it s either gonna be the m7659n or m7690n both by hp i guess the difference between them is the m7659 is an upgraded system in terms of software and harware the 7659 gives windows media center as an option </s>
<s> i really don t know what this means but to me sounds like it s better but i could be wrong i ve askd hp reps but all i m gettn back is a sales pitch becuase they only offer the m7659n and they couldn t clear up the hd dvd </s>
<s> sthanks again </s>
<s> you re going to have a particularly hard time finding a large sized company that will still sell a windows xp system </s>
<s> your best bet in that regard is to look for a local independent store i e </s>
<s> not best buy circuit city or others like them and see what they have on offer </s>
<s> they can usually custom order hardware that will get the job done but don t be surprised if you re really pushing the limit by asking for an hd dvd drive they re usually a few hundred or more by themselves </s>
<s> as for the question of hd dvd versus hd television that s something you can blame on tv networks </s>
<s> most are terrified that you ll copy their shows </s>
<s> there are tuners that will catch free over the air broadcasts but you d need a special cablecard tuner and the requisite cablecard from your cable or satellite provider to get most of it </s>
<s> i have to ask do you really want to buy into hd dvd on your computer when it s as expensive as it is now and we don t know whether it or blu ray will win the movie format wars </s>
<s> i d rather save the money for a stand alone player for my tv if that much </s>
<s> and stick to a dvd drive in the computer for now </s>
<s> i just ordered a microexpress desktop </s>
<s> i got the microflex 66b which comes standard with window xp and it is customizable this received an excellent review on the pc world website </s>
<s> shipping however is extra </s>
<s> i could let you know more when i get it jj </s>
<s> the m7690n has a faster cpu e6400 2 13ghz vs e6300 1 86 ghz 1gb more ram 500gb hard drive vs 250gb hd dvd drive m7659 does not and geforce 7600gt graphics vs 7500le </s>
<s> so the m7690n is certainly worth a 300 price premium </s>
<s> neither will display hd tv channels because neither has an hd tuner card </s>
<s> you could add a hd tuner but you d have to either dump the modem card no free pci slots or go with an external usb tuner my suggestion is the hauppauge wintv hvr 950 for 110 </s>
<s> the m7690n comes with the necessary software to play hd dvds hp dvd play hd dvd 2 2 </s>
<s> as for an hdcp capable monitor the acer al2216wbd is a 22 quot widescreen for about 320 the sceptre x20wc is a 20 quot widescreen and is about 220 </s>
<s> m7659n specs m7690n specs wintv hvr 950 sceptre x20wc acer al2216wbd </s>
<s> hey thanks for all the info this puts it all in to perspective hp faild to give this info about hd i suppose at a latter time the 7690 could handle vista so it looks like i leaning more towards it and gonna check out those monitors thanks again </s>
<s> lenovo think centre m55e 9637 as is and i would purchase an external sony burner drive this pc is alot of projects all in one place if i was to be purchaseing this day i might look into vista but i need the full version software no upgrades the above pc with xp professional and some roxio software a creative sound card thats about all is needed to run for a couple of years </s>
<s> unlike the other people i suggest u look at buying a computer from cyber power pc because not only is it a lot more exxpensive at other places they have a huge variety and you could always chat with a representative if you have any questions on their website ps </s>
<s> dont buy their laptops they weight too much and if i were you i would pay an extra 20 bucks and they will connectthe wires for you their website is www cyberpowerpc com </s>
<s> this is just my opinion and i don t want to disparage anyone else who took the time to post </s>
<s> i m self employed as a computer geek and i sell a lot of hardware to families home businesses and small businesses so that s where i m coming from </s>
<s> my opinion is that if you stick with the name brands and do your homework you ll be fine </s>
<s> you ve obviously studied the dvd issue and you know that there is some variation there </s>
<s> beyond that set a budget for yourself and stick with it </s>
<s> companies like dell will kill you with little add ons and upgrades when you try to finalize your purchase </s>
<s> ask the vendor about the warranty where will it be fixed </s>
<s> if it s a depot warranty and the depot is 1000 miles away then you will be without your machine for quite a while </s>
<s> also be sure that you understand the warranty </s>
<s> most warranties cover only what it takes to put the machine back to the way it was when you purchased it </s>
<s> that makes sense because it would be problematic for them to try to reinstall everything you added when you got it home </s>
<s> even though it makes sense it s still maddening to the purchaser because it could end up costing them more above and beyond the warranty coverage </s>
<s> i strongly endorse a quality monitor as part of the purchase </s>
<s> you re going to be staring at it for a long time </s>
<s> don t beat yourself up over the price difference between 17 quot and 19 quot </s>
<s> get the 19 quot and enjoy it </s>
<s> you can t upgrade a monitor once you ve purchased it </s>
<s> try to arrange the ram such that there s room for upgrade without having to pitch what s already in there </s>
<s> for example if you elect to get 1gb then buy a 1gb stick and leave the other slot empty </s>
<s> don t get 2 512mb sticks because you ll have to toss one in in order to install a new one </s>
<s> an extra bay in the chassis for another hard drive is a nice thing to have </s>
<s> if you add a drive then you don t have to move everything off your original drive </s>
<s> if you don t have room for a 2nd drive you can always hook up an external usb drive and use that as a 2nd drive </s>
<s> resign yourself that the system will seem outdated in 6 months </s>
<s> it s ok get something to back up with </s>
<s> if you choose to back up on dvds then do it regularly </s>
<s> i assume that you ll probably store your photos on your hard drive </s>
<s> imagine what your life would be like if those photos suddenly vanished </s>
<s> feed on that fear and use it to backup regularly </s>
<s> get your o s on disk </s>
<s> don t depend on that secret partition to be there when you need to restore </s>
<s> vendors try to save a buck by hiding the installation image on your hard drive which might work ok sometimes but if the drive is unavailable so is the installation partition </s>
<s> i have an hp thats 8 months old and lost my restore disk that i originally had to make in a catastrophic weather event </s>
<s> i had to reformat recently due to virus </s>
<s> lost the quot secret partition doing that </s>
<s> cannot get a replacement and restore disk from hp </s>
<s> computer still in warranty </s>
<s> they will not help me </s>
<s> have previously had very good service from hp but this time they will not help </s>
<s> on line ordering says disk not available </s>
<s> why is this and the box is only 8 months old </s>
<s> i am so upset that i purposely went out and searched for a new computer with an o s disk </s>
<s> 1 800 888 tech support people tell me that they can t order the disk for me because they are out of it </s>
<s> online ordering says they are out of it </s>
<s> the great sales dept says to contact the 1 800 888 support folks </s>
<s> the complaint dept says the same </s>
<s> so i went out and bought a toshiba laptop with an o s disk and other restoration disk furnished with the computer </s>
<s> screw hp </s>
<s> they are as bad as lexar products </s>
<s> i too am in the market for a pc gaming and read anything i can find about advice on pc purchase </s>
<s> i must say your reply was very clear and logical and most of all usefull for anyone in the market for new pc </s>
<s> i ve been trying to learn as much as possible about quot futureproofing a pc quot </s>
<s> i ve narrowed down my system to a gateway 530 configured like this qx6700 extreme quad core overclocked to 3 2 4mb ram 2x250 7200rpm raid 0 hard drives vista ultimate and will wait till they offer 8800 series gpu card promised soon </s>
<s> what is your opion on this configuration </s>
<s> i want to not have to upgrade in 6mo or a yr and want to be ready for direct x10 and quad core designed games hoping that will happen as predicted by many online sites </s>
<s> i m wondering why you want a pc and not an imac </s>
<s> you can do the things you want with more simplicity and less fuss and the software you need will be easy to find </s>
<s> internet security will be better and crashes will be less likely </s>
<s> why didn t you buy the disc from microsoft </s>
<s> i m a mac person but i had to buy winxp vista wasn t out yet for college work </s>
<s> it was only 80 or something </s>
<s> i also had to buy osx when my hard drive fried </s>
<s> it s not hard </s>
<s> have you ever given thought to buying local </s>
<s> i am biased here because i build custom pcs for a living </s>
<s> quot us quot smaller custom shops can pull parts from a larger pool and monitor each part for the best warranties performance </s>
<s> i start of each sale by asking the customer what they want expect their pc to do and we build from there </s>
<s> i encourage customer input and their own research </s>
<s> did hp offer you a case or a power supply with a lifetime warranty how about 5 years on a hard drive </s>
<s> every new system i sell is set up and running when the customer picks it up because i want them to sit down and play a little before packing it up </s>
<s> that way i can answer any questions they have and show them where everything plugs in </s>
<s> no mere doubts and unanswered questions do all be all emac macbook </s>
<s> i m new with all computers too and my first computer was dell i paid 1670 95 for things i did not need but i wanted the program call dell learn to learn how to play with my new toy the very first day i was on the internet the next day i tryed to learn more so i went to dell learn </s>
<s> it took me 6 days with the help of dells 1 800 number to place my name and password into dell learn for the next 11 days i tryed to log on with the help of the 1 800 number i tryed for 45 day or more and still can t get in so i call a new 1 800 number for dell and dell told me it s the sofeware and i must call the sofeware co i told them i m calling the sofeware co it s dell learning dell gave me the round around so i called the state of nevada for help with the help of the state of nevada dell took the computer back and paid for the shiping too </s>
<s> after i recevied my money back i went to apple computer now i own a mac g 5 i m very happy if anything goes worng with my apple all i do is call apple 1 800 number and apple will help me fix it if apple can t fix my computer over the phone all i do is take my computer to an apple store and apple is very happt to fix it </s>
<s> u got power fair price specially the 24 quot imac but a macbook is also very nice small and has a lower price </s>
<s> the ilife suite is everything you need to make a super digital photoalbum </s>
<s> like some have said most major retailors now have completely switched to selling windows vista </s>
<s> you d have to ask an independent local builder or buy a copy of xp yourself at your local electronics store they still sell them </s>
<s> as for hd dvd drive i d advise against it </s>
<s> if the hd dvd loses the format war then your hd dvd drive will be good as nothing and you d have to buy a blu ray drive </s>
<s> for what you want to do with your new computer why not get a mac </s>
<s> they are a lot easier to set up then an xp and you can not only watch dvd s but burn them too on selected models </s>
<s> i reccommend going to an apple store and finding out all you can about macs and if you do like the look of the macs you can install bootcamp on it and still run windows xp </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> hp is a good mak no doubt but you can probably get a better computer from alienware </s>
<s> your price range fits the lower end of their line but these are still excellent because alienware set a very high standard </s>
<s> also what is good about the alienware computers is because before you buy it you can choose everything in it from how big your cache is to hard drive to what opertaing system you have </s>
<s> they do you look a bit different </s>
<s> but i assure you they are very very fast and efficient </s>
<s> they are good computers and are fully customizable </s>
<s> also you said you wanted the computer for gaming aswell </s>
<s> well alienware are practically the kings of gaming computers </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> macintosh are good computers no doubt </s>
<s> good as in for designing grapgics and other things </s>
<s> but they are not particularly fast and they do not support pretty much any games unless you want to play unreal tournament 2004 for the rest of your life </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i have purchased 5 computer systems for myself and family in the past 2 years from kevin and have never had one single problem </s>
<s> would suggest you go to resellerratings com and look at the store reviews </s>
<s> you tell kevin what you want to use system for and how much you want to spend and he will hold your hand </s>
<s> he is very patient with newbies and will spend as much time as necessary for you to be satisfied </s>
<s> by all means stay away from gateway </s>
<s> lots of luck </s>
<s> i have read absolutly horrible user reviews for dell alienware hp but have not seen many negitive on gateway </s>
<s> the editors reviews read very positive for gateway except little room for expansion and sloppy wiring </s>
<s> is there a source of reviews of the reviews </s>
<s> is there any reviewers that buy the units they test not get them direct from manufacturer </s>
<s> for around 3 000 00 for a new gaming pc i don t want to get stuck with bad product or service </s>
