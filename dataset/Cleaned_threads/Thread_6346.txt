<s> hey folks just wanted to know if there are dedicated usb servers </s>
<s> i m not sure if that s what they are called but basically i am looking to hook up a couple of external hard drives to a wireless network </s>
<s> i also plan on attaching a printer as well </s>
<s> i have found dedicated printer servers but haven t been able to find just a usb one </s>
<s> i know of a couple wireless routers that have usb ports built in but that will be a last resort </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i can share printer servers and usb drive servers but so far there are not many quot usb quot servers </s>
<s> there are reasons why but why not get what you need </s>
<s> bob </s>
