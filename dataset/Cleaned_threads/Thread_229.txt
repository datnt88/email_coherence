<s> as it gets ready to feed a new piece of paper hp photosmart 8250 makes horrid grinding noise </s>
<s> it makes normal clicking noises then very fast thack thack thack thack more normal clicking and then another set of grinding </s>
<s> there are no error messages and it prints just fine when there s ink </s>
<s> it s been doing this for a while and we ve been ignoring it </s>
<s> what could cause it </s>
<s> i posted this question in hp s forum in january and got no replies </s>
<s> we don t print enough to use the ink up before it expires </s>
<s> we ignore the warnings about using expired ink </s>
<s> that wouldn t cause this would it </s>
<s> those expiration messages are just so annoying </s>
<s> now it won t print black white because it says we are out of yellow ink </s>
<s> what does yellow ink have to do with printing black white </s>
<s> we don t know whether to throw this piece of cr p away or buy more ink and put up with grinding noise </s>
<s> this is windows 7 home 64 bit </s>
<s> any advice would be most welcome </s>
<s> i see at this was first available in 2005 any consumer grade printer is non repairable for very simple reasons </s>
<s> the minimum shop fee is over 100 bucks and a new printer can be had for less </s>
<s> this does infuriate some folk so we know to not upset them by writing about this issue </s>
<s> oops </s>
<s> i see folk do sell used ones starting at 50 bucks so your choice to get another to take its place without issues </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i suppose it did serve us well </s>
<s> it s not the answer i was hoping for </s>
<s> yes i m one of the folks that gets infuriated by the planned obsolescence </s>
<s> something else to add to the landfill not to mention the waste unused and probably expired ink cartridges but no yellow </s>
<s> i hear you but are you willing to pay for the repairs that cost more than the printer </s>
<s> it s not planned ob it s simple economics </s>
<s> if you can make a printer for 50 bucks retail that lasts for 2 years then why not </s>
<s> it beats having to pay about a grand for a printer that lasts a decade </s>
<s> 250 bucks is cheaper than 1 000 </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am using that same printer and it will make that noise when it s doing self maintenance </s>
<s> if it has a empty ink cartridge it will do the clunky weird noise almost every time you try to print </s>
<s> i let one of the cartidges go dry when i first got the printer and it did just what you are discribing </s>
<s> after i replaced the cartridge the noise went away except for when it does it s maintenance </s>
<s> have not let one go dry since and no noise </s>
<s> you may have a different problem but as bob said it s not worth wasting money to have it repaired when a new printer is cheaper </s>
<s> thanks </s>
