<s> specs old mobo pc chips m811 v3 1 new mobo pc chips m863g old gpu nvidia geforce 5500 fx new gpu radeon 9550 proc amd athlon xp 2400 ram kingston ddr400 512mb plus a lite on cd dvd drive and another atapi dvd drive so as soon as i reinstalled windows didn t format just did a fresh install updated my drivers and ran windows update a hundred times my system is running noticably slower than it was before </s>
<s> the first thing i noticed was that my bios was reporting that i was using an athlon 1800 or something which was fixed when i adjusted the cpu frequency to 133 in the bios </s>
<s> this was after i tried adjusting it to 166 where my system wouldn t start up and required me to clear the cmos </s>
<s> the dram clock is set to automatically by the bios which is 200mhz </s>
<s> the dram cas latency is set to automatic because i don t have any idea what it does </s>
<s> the slowdown is especially noticable when i m running games where the fps were 40 to 50 are now like 10 and 15 i ve also been getting lt i gt blasted lt i gt by random like sound bursts of static </s>
<s> it s very painful </s>
<s> so am i forgetting something </s>
<s> should i try formatting </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> oh this is definitely important </s>
<s> my cpu is reporting to be running at 2ghz but i m certain that before it was running at 2 4 </s>
<s> also the key difference between the 2 motherboards is that the new one runs at fsb 333 the other one was fsb 266 </s>
<s> which version of the m863g did you get </s>
<s> the 5v or 3v </s>
<s> and did you make sure all the new parts are speced right </s>
<s> i noticed you did not use the recommended memory </s>
<s> although it might work you still can t guarantee it s even running at 333 messing with bus speeds is ok as long as you know what you are doing </s>
<s> personally i wouldn t even use your setup for gaming </s>
<s> i d be using a 800fsb with the cpu to match and the dual channel memory </s>
<s> but i can understand if you are constrained by the pocket book </s>
<s> so as long as you are not using what was recommended i can t help you </s>
<s> check those things out </s>
<s> maybe you ll find you mismatched some things </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
<s> i didn t see any indication of recommended memory anywhere and again though my previous motherboard wasn t as good it ran on the same ram without a hitch </s>
<s> but what would you suggest i do </s>
<s> find ram running at 333 </s>
<s> i m having a very hard time understanding why my previous set up worked better than this one </s>
<s> the performance is just as bad when i m not running any big apps </s>
<s> cursor lag window lag it s very disturbing and it is absolutely boggling my mind </s>
<s> v5 by the way </s>
<s> the ddr400 memory will work but only at 333mhz because the fsb is only 333 let s look at your performance lack of issues </s>
<s> what do you use for anti virus spyware adware malware and registry cleaner software </s>
<s> if you haven t done any of that you need to </s>
<s> sounds like you may have picked up a virus trojan spyware somewhere </s>
<s> there are plenty of good free ones around </s>
<s> let us know </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
<s> you must have messed up </s>
<s> did you set agp settings correctly </s>
<s> are you using ati drivers instead of nvidia </s>
