<s> hi to everybody just got my pc parts from newegg but encountered a problem with this mobo in the users guide that came with it chapter2 hardware setup 1 jumper setting set the cpu external clock frequency ratio and the cpu voltage according to the instruction printed on the manual or silkscreen printed on the mainboard </s>
<s> now i read all the guide carefully but didnt find anything mentioning where and how to setup jumpers for any cpu </s>
<s> does that mean that the mobo is jumperless </s>
<s> on the mobo i found only 4 jumpers jp1 cmos clear jp2 cpu fan jp3 jp4 both 3 and 4 are power on by usb i m just afraid im missing something here </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> what s happened to their support </s>
<s> do they just dump this stuff in your lap and run away </s>
<s> why would you buy for such people </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bios area </s>
<s> most newer mobos only require setting one parameter </s>
<s> are you sure that quot cpu external clock ratio quot is the correct terminology </s>
<s> modern cpu s have their multiplier clock ratio top locked you can lower it if overclocking what settings are allowed </s>
<s> my bet would be that you are setting the memory bus speed so that the correct fsb gets set </s>
<s> what speed memory are you using </s>
<s> seems that robert thinks that newegg sold you a kit </s>
<s> they are only a parts supplier </s>
<s> automatically </s>
<s> just set the mobo up with cpu with hsf memory video and monitor </s>
<s> front panel connections nothing else </s>
<s> turn power on and get the first video screen </s>
<s> get that shutdown and hook up a keyboard and turn on again and go into bios it will show the cpu frequency et al </s>
<s> don t bother installing anything else until you get this far </s>
<s> if the speeds are incoreect the mobo should default to the lowest to protect the cpu </s>
<s> the voltage sttings are probably for overclockers use </s>
<s> doesn t the mob manual show a default setting for the voltage </s>
<s> with that the mobo sets it automatically for the cpu </s>
<s> yes i used the correct terminology </s>
<s> in the user guide there is a two page bios setup program chapter from which the only thing about voltage and stuff is frequency voltage control allowing to adjust freq volt of mobo </s>
<s> im using roswell 512 ddram pc3200 </s>
