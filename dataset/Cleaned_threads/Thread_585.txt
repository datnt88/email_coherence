<s> hello all my brother has just bought and installed a pc memory stick that gives me around 75gb extra memory </s>
<s> i have no idea about the internal workings of a pc so he bought and installed the stick for me </s>
<s> he has told me that the stick has been installed properly </s>
<s> how can i access that new memory from my pc </s>
<s> does the stick automatcally create a new disk drive in my coputer </s>
<s> where can i find the memory stick memory information on windows xp </s>
<s> how do i save things to the stick instead of the my harddrive </s>
<s> to be sure it is installed properly your brother must have tried it so it seems logical to me he showed you that it worked correctly and how to use it </s>
<s> i assume it isn t a flash drive but something with a rather large hard disk inside </s>
<s> and i assume it s just a drive letter maybe d maybe g in my computer </s>
<s> so saving or moving anything to it can be done by selecting the g drive in stead of the c drive </s>
<s> and you can move or copy anything to it using my computer or windows explorer like you copy or move to any other drive </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> hello again my brother is on vacation for two weeks and i have no way of contacting him </s>
<s> i have no idea what type of memory stick he used or what brand i don t even have the manual </s>
<s> i have just checked my computer and there is no new driver listed </s>
<s> has anybody got any ideas </s>
<s> has it installed correctly </s>
<s> shane </s>
<s> i m afraid it is impossible to say more about it with the information you give </s>
<s> it might even be a second internal hard disk in stead of an external device </s>
<s> and it might be for example that it still has to be partitioned and formatted using disk management </s>
<s> that should be in the manual </s>
<s> nothing much to do but wait till your brother returns </s>
<s> or bring it to a local shop and let them fix it </s>
<s> if they see it they will know what to do with it to get it up and running </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> the info you have given us is rather confusing </s>
<s> you keep referring to a memory stick also known as ram or random access memory which very briefly only increases the working area for running programs and other functions it is not for storage </s>
<s> so my question is did he install extra ram or an internal hard drive </s>
<s> do you see any components outside the computer like sitting on the desktop somewhere with wires going to the computer </s>
<s> if not he installed an extra hard drive internally </s>
<s> right click my computer and click manage </s>
<s> on the windows that opens click disk management and see if there is a new drive there </s>
<s> right click the drive and click initiate </s>
<s> when that is done you will need to format the drive </s>
<s> hello again there is no new external hard drive sitting anywhere on my pc </s>
<s> i have just tried the manage option on my computer and it only lists my original c hard drive and dvd player </s>
<s> it looks like i will have to wait for my brother to come home </s>
<s> shane </s>
<s> hello again i have just solved the problem </s>
<s> my brother actually installed an updated graphics card that came with its own memory </s>
<s> that s why i could not find any new hard drive info on my pc </s>
<s> thanks for all the help shane </s>
<s> that s a pretty interesting discovery </s>
<s> the larger video card will not give you any extra storage space but it should give you a little better performance for video functions </s>
