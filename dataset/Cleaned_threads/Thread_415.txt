<s> i set my computer to not cut off if it encountered a problem with the ram instead it would show the blue error screen haven t seen it yet so i m assuming it s not that </s>
<s> i ve also heard that software issues can cause a system to fail so i m booted into safe mode at the moment </s>
<s> should i just do a full re install of windows and see if that helps </s>
<s> a few hours ago my pc cut off and attempted to reboot and cut off a few seconds into it </s>
<s> then repeat </s>
<s> i had to flip the power switch in the rear to stop the process </s>
<s> is it safe to continue using or should i leave it be until i can figure out the problem </s>
<s> i ve heard that power supplies in general can be prone to failing after short periods of time i ve only had this build for about 4 5 months </s>
<s> any help would be great i m pretty lost at the moment </s>

<s> why did you install a psu with split rails </s>
<s> also the video card called for quot minimum 500w or greater system power supply quot which you supplied </s>
<s> now go find an oval track and drive your car at 120mph </s>
<s> how long till it fails </s>
<s> game machine builders tend to get single rail units and learn to not install the minimum </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the video card requires two 6 pin pci express connectors does that have anything to do with the number of rails </s>
<s> also how many watts should i go for </s>
<s> 550 </s>
<s> 650 </s>
<s> but mostly about how many amperes a pin can carry </s>
<s> this is why more than two wires are needed and more than one connection because the amperes exceed that of a pin a connector and so on </s>
<s> your choice on the psu but my advice is to go with single rail power supplies unless you know how to figure out what s on each rail how many amperes is being drawn on each rail etc </s>
<s> most folk do not want to go that deep </s>
<s> hence single rail and at least 50 over the minimum </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> as mentioned your psu is not going to cut it </s>
<s> suggestion </s>
<s> go here </s>
<s> filter by psu </s>
<s> filter by corsair or pc power cooling </s>
<s> pick one that s 600w or bigger bigger does no harm </s>
<s> their all single rail units no fuss </s>
