<s> greetings after my 1 firewall router died recently i bought a befvp41 so i could dial into via vpn my home lan while on the road </s>
<s> setting up the befvp41 at least seemed easy </s>
<s> getting a xp client going was another story </s>
<s> getting to see ping use network shares is the 1 problem now </s>
<s> the befvp41 only supports ipsec tunnels which configuring under xp is a royal pain after scanning a number of forums about vpn s i decided on trying a vpn client solution instead of using the built in but dreadfully painfull client support in xp </s>
<s> if you search high and low about the internet you may find sshsentinel 1 3 2 </s>
<s> this vpn client is free for non comercial use </s>
<s> it was easy to setup this client to connect to my befvp41 </s>
<s> however once setup it automaticly loads on system startup and reroutes all network traffic to the vpn existing or not thereby breaking network connections when you are not using a vpn </s>
<s> i ended up uninstalling it as i m 99 non vpn and might use vpn 1 of the time </s>
<s> greenbow_vpn is another solution spoken about in many forums </s>
<s> this client was easy to setup to connect to my befvp41 however the public license is only for a 30 60 day trial </s>
<s> i uninstalled it </s>
<s> after much searching i came across the draytek vpn client </s>
<s> written by draytek in china for their brand of vpn routers this client loads a device driver as part of its client solution </s>
<s> the driver comes up as another network connection under xp </s>
<s> the nice part about all this is that the client program driver will create network configuration changes on the fly thereby not breaking connections when the vpn is not in use </s>
<s> this was also easy to setup to connect to my befvp41 </s>
<s> when the tunnel is active connected the client application will show a little green light indicator and the connection will not have a red x ontop of it in the system tray </s>
<s> pretty cool </s>
<s> so what does all this have to do with network shares over a vpn </s>
<s> in all cases while i was able to get the clients to work connect with my linksys vpn router i was unable to access the vpn router or any of the network shares attached to it </s>
<s> i finally decided that my routing tables must not be setup correctly to route to lt gt from my lan addresses through the vpn tunnel </s>
<s> 1 client address lt gt server address 65 mylaptop lt gt 66 mylan 2 client secure group lt gt server secure group 192 168 2 0 lt gt 192 168 2 0 this dident work </s>
<s> i read somewhere that the lan segments on both ends needed to be different </s>
<s> 3 client secure group lt gt server secure group 192 168 4 0 lt gt 192 168 2 0 this dident work ether </s>
<s> after much reading i m under the miss understanding that a the tunnel needs to have a different ip address scheme then ether of the lan segments on ether end </s>
<s> b the tunnel needs to have a different ip address scheme then the fqdn of ether end </s>
<s> c i have to manually setup route s on each end to direct traffic through the tunnel </s>
<s> client address lt gt server address 65 mylaptop lt gt 66 mylan clientsecuregroup addr lt gt serversecuregroup addr 10 0 2 1 lt gt 10 0 1 1 client lan segment lt gt server lan segment 192 168 4 0 lt gt 192 168 2 0 client side route add 192 168 2 0 255 255 255 0 10 0 1 1 lt serverend gt route add 10 0 1 1 255 255 255 0 10 0 2 1 lt clientend gt server side in vpn router route add 192 168 4 0 255 255 255 0 10 0 0 2 lt clientend gt route add 10 0 2 1 255 255 255 0 10 0 1 1 lt serverend gt i ll let you all know if this works </s>
<s> in the mean time i m sure that the readers of this forum will show me the errors of my ways lt g gt mark </s>
<s> i have found free and paid editions to be much easier to use for connecting remotely </s>
<s> the free edition is great </s>
<s> when using a befvp41 and vpn i opted to use a software vpn on a server in the other lan to get to network shares </s>
<s> also using two befvp41s to connect the two lans together all of the time works well </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> jeff </s>
<s> greetings a quick look at quot logmein quot appears to be a paid service </s>
<s> not what i was looking for at all or any help at all </s>
<s> did not see any quot free quot options other than quot free trial quot not free </s>
<s> i have a number of free vpn clients already and have a vpn router that i paid good for </s>
<s> i m connecting via laptop gt cellphone gt internet gt befvp41 gt lan </s>
<s> if you ve found that the cnet forums are lacking on help with more complicated configurations quot broadbandreports com quot has forums for all the major network hardware manufacturers as well as most of the big isp s </s>
<s> quot linksysinfo com quot has a bunch of information for linksys routers </s>
