<s> i have an intel core2 duo 3 00ghz cpu and have been advised to upgrade to a better cpu as the one i have is going to be stopped from being made anymore </s>
<s> of course it all depends on what other intel cpu will be compatible with my mobo which is an asus p5kpl cm </s>
<s> i m pleased with what i have and don t want to upgrade any other components if i can help it as i did a major upgrade about 18 months ago and the pc is perfectly adequate for my gaming needs </s>
<s> please advise </s>
<s> the c2d at 3ghz should be near the top of its class so i would not bother with changing it </s>
<s> i might look at the video card instead </s>
<s> try bob </s>
<s> i have a geforce nvidia 9800 gtx </s>
<s> graphics card mobo cpu all upgraded at same time </s>
<s> you are the usual pinnacle of what a gamer s machine might look like </s>
<s> adding a few mhz to the cpu won t do much for a gamer here </s>
<s> how ever simple things like moving from wifi to ethernet may be the easy way to get some gaming quot points quot bob </s>
<s> thanks for the comments guys i really valued your opinions </s>
<s> the next cpu up from mine would undoubtedly be a quad core but there s still a premium to pay with the price despite them being old hat now </s>
<s> there s one cpu quad at 300 phew </s>
<s> as bob said it s not worth the extra few mhz i might get </s>
<s> thx again it s nice knowing guys like you will offer honest opinions and i was just fishing around for a second opinion </s>
<s> cheers </s>
