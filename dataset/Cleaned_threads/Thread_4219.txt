<s> i have not been a a big fan of the past amd processors </s>
<s> i have had pentiums </s>
<s> looking to get a new set up and looking at the large price difference </s>
<s> reading reports and such make me re think the athlon </s>
<s> which is better for gaming videos mp3 s and such </s>
<s> amd athlon 64 or intel pentium d processor </s>
<s> i would like to get the most bang for the buck </s>
<s> the problems i have seen in the past is incompatability with software and the amd </s>
<s> the hot one now is the amd 64 dual core and 2 pci express video cards nvidia geforce in sli mode </s>
<s> but that s top end </s>
<s> i have a single core amd athlon 64 and it runs quieter and uses less power than intel </s>
<s> a great little chip </s>
<s> thanks for the information </s>
<s> have you had any incompatability issues with software </s>
<s> i usually run the firefox browser and do some light video editing and some games </s>
<s> i just need to put in a graphics card and maybe boost the ram a bit to 1 gb </s>
<s> quot amd athlon 64 x2 quot processors </s>
<s> x2 dual core </s>
<s> i am looking at the new pentium 975x chipset and the speed it has w ht dual core w ht and wondering if you went for intel or amd and what your experiences have been with your decision </s>
<s> i am about to make this decission between amd and intel and would appreciate any input </s>
<s> with the new dual core 975x it is tempting to go with pentium but the benchmarking is really confusing and this is a new addition from intel hasn t been around enough for me to find much from anyone who has seen it in action </s>
<s> suggestions </s>
<s> looking to add a new windows pc that can use vista later do picture and film work but not full length and don t do gaming </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> after checking out everything here at cnet and at a site tomeshardware com i figured out that the amd x2 either the 4200 or the 3800 will more than do what i want it to do </s>
<s> now i have to decide between the hp or gateway variations </s>
<s> not this computer but the next i will probably build it </s>
<s> all tests i saw had the amd x2 s dominating the intel d s </s>
<s> srieth </s>
<s> even intel has thrown that out because amd cpu s outperform them while running at much lower speeds </s>
<s> almost all new intels at this time are desperate moves on their part as gap fillers until they can get their new lower power heat lower clock speed cpu s out and end up with improved performance from new architecture </s>
<s> not looking at only speed issues even though it is a factor </s>
<s> looking at over all value </s>
<s> take a intal and amd of the same cofiguration and i have found that the intel is the most expensive by 200 300 dollars </s>
<s> also checking out cnets tests and a few other sites tests it is a decisive amd love fest </s>
<s> i will admit that i have not liked atholons up until this point but this should change that additude </s>
<s> srieth </s>
<s> intel s advertised speed is always higher than amd because it uses a technique called quad data rate which transfers 4 data per clock cycle </s>
<s> let s say the intel cpu is said to be 3 2ghz it s real clock is actually only 800mhz because 3200 4 800 </s>
<s> amd uses a technique called double data rate it transfers 2 data per clock </s>
<s> therefore lets say u have an amd with 2 2ghz the true clock is 2200 2 which equals to 1 1ghz </s>
<s> thus amd is actually faster than intel </s>
<s> it may not make sense to you now but if you look at the link on the bottom and do some other research you will see what i am talking about </s>
<s> you may not understand what i am saying now because i am bad at explaining things but you will after some googling </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s> because usually in the benchmarks you see now the intel test systems are not optimized while amd is because the amd one usaully has dual channel ddr400 </s>
<s> in order for a system to be optimized the cpu s fsb must match half the ddr frequency </s>
<s> amd with 400mhz fsb dual channel ddr400 optimized intel with 800mhz fsb dual channel ddr800 optimized </s>
