<s> i have a toshiba external 160gb hard drive </s>
<s> the cable that connects the drive to the computer is starting to fail </s>
<s> i would like to buy a replacement </s>
<s> i know that it is not the harddrive because this happened before </s>
<s> i contacted toshiba and they sent me the only cable they had </s>
<s> but it did not work </s>
<s> they suggested i buy a replacement cable from any computer store which i did and that did not work either </s>
<s> the usb cable that comes with the harddrive has what looks like a section that can provide more power to the driver so it can run efficiently </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> all you need to do is match the connectors </s>
<s> the types that offer a second power connector will sometimes work better as not all usb ports can provide the same amount of current </s>
<s> sometimes however an apparent cable failure is a poor connection at the device itself </s>
<s> these aren t always easy to troubleshoot </s>
<s> another option might be to buy another external enclosure that comes with its own cable and put the hard drive in that </s>
<s> you d have to pull the drive out to make sure it s no some proprietary design </s>
<s> i ve heard that some external drives have the usb connection as part of the controller rather than an sata to internal adapter </s>
<s> since you didn t ask any specific question such as quot will this work quot or quot what should i do quot that s about all i can offer </s>
<s> you try and find a cable with the extra power connector or try another enclosure </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> usb 2 0 y cable a male x 2 to mini b male x 1 let us know how it turns out </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> what makers don t tell you is that usb powered drives are notoriously unreliable </s>
<s> i can take a model that didn t work on the owner s machine and plug it into some rear usb port of a desktop and it works </s>
<s> it s a shame they produced this product without taking into account quot the real world quot bob </s>
<s> come with ac adapters too like the one below </s>
<s> it s usb 2 0 and esata </s>
<s> external enclosure are great but they do have lots of potential problems from voltage cooling drive capacity cables etc </s>
<s> not to mention underpowered usb ports at the host </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
