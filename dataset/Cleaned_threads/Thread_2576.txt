<s> does anyone know of a cable hub that converts firewire to usb </s>
<s> i bought the new aluminum macbook thinking i was done with ieee 1394 but as luck would have it i need to plug in a friends camcorder and its not compatible </s>
<s> the camcorder is a canon gl2 </s>
<s> there are hardly any converters or cables that exist to do what you are asking for </s>
<s> firewire and usb are two completely different technologies </s>
<s> i d suggest either transferring the video to a firewire bearing computer or to a different camera that has usb connectivity </s>
<s> according to the canon site this camera can use minidv tapes and or sd cards right </s>
<s> if you re using sd cards there are multiple devices out there with sd and usb connections like some digital cameras etc </s>
<s> if you are using tapes which i am going to guess you are i m sure you could find some sort of minidv recorder that has usb </s>
<s> should be some out there </s>
<s> however i feel the best solution would be to import the video onto another computer and store the file on a dvd or an external hard drive </s>
<s> whatever works best for you </s>
<s> good luck </s>

<s> a firewire to usb adapter converter is not available </s>
<s> you will some advertised for a healthy price but they usually do not work well </s>
<s> of course i may have opened the flood gates with that statement </s>

<s> has anyone else tried editing with their 13 quot macbook and realized it has no firewire capability </s>
<s> is there no solution to this problem when your camcorder only has firewire output </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if your macbook lacks a firewire port and your camera requires one you ll have to find another solution to connect the two </s>
<s> if the camera accepts memory cards or can use an adapter of its own to connect via usb i d try that but given that it uses firewire chances sound slim to me </s>
<s> i d guess then that the easiest thing you could do is switch cameras if possible </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> depending on which model you purchased there may be a few options </s>
<s> if you have a 13 15 or 17 macbook pro you have firewire 800 the adapters for a firewire 800 to firewire 400 i beelive are more reliable </s>
<s> the 17 model also has an express slot </s>
<s> you can buy express cards that provide firewire 400 ports </s>
<s> the op knows what firewire is he knows what it looks like </s>
<s> he knows he does not have it on his macbook he knew that when he purchased it </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> sonnet makes a external 2 port firewire 400 and 1 port usb 2 0 expresscard 34 that will fit in your expresscard slot that ought to get you where you want to go </s>
