<s> hi this decision is painfully difficult for me right now </s>
<s> i can t decide between tablet hybrids </s>
<s> i know the specs and everything but the design type is eluding me </s>
<s> i need to use a tablet mostly as an e reader and math writer stylus for my books and math class but i need it to function well with a keyboard for typing essays and reports for english science ss theology </s>
<s> the ultimate goal is to have a mid cheap atom based tablet plus keyboard preferred to have trackpad </s>
<s> most have 2gb lpddr2 and 1 5 1 8 ghz clover trail </s>
<s> i d like to keep it in the atom tablet range to keep it cheap </s>
<s> i m mostly stuck between tablets like the asus vivotab tf810c and the dell latitude 10 business model plus bluetooth keyboard case and larger battery </s>
<s> other than that hp envy x2 is nice but no digitizer </s>
<s> any help with this or added tablet options would be great </s>
<s> with the asus vivotab i m reaching 870 with msd card and keyboard dock </s>
<s> this is getting into ultrabook range but the lenovo yoga doesn t support active digitizers and i don t know any other convertibles in this range that reach 8 hr for a full day s use at school </s>
<s> why this is is well discussed </s>
<s> but here we go again </s>
<s> since the battery is just a 300 cycle rated part and the warranty only calls the battery bad when it drops to 50 capacity you see that to get 8 hours a day for 2 years you need a battery that when new hits 16 hours and then in 2 years you are still getting your 8 hours </s>
<s> what s odd about such a requirement is it s rarity </s>
<s> you might find new students that want this or think it s a requirement but if it was then wouldn t there be plenty of choices </s>
<s> ok battery s done </s>
<s> on to the digitizer </s>
<s> what do you use now </s>
<s> why i ask is that i find many ask for this then in a year they are back to mouse or pad </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m in high school right now and my classes are still crammed together making a 7 hour school day </s>
<s> there s my 8 hour requirement </s>
<s> after school i m free to move about and find a power outlet </s>
<s> next year i ll be in college and have charge time between classes </s>
<s> i might start saving now and sell this tablet hybrid after a year to move up to a core i hybrid with less battery and more performance </s>
<s> i ve done my research on digitizer pens and palm rejection and how it works </s>
<s> last year i was all pen and paper </s>
<s> i m very interested in writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus </s>
<s> i ll be adjusting to the glassy surface and need the touchscreen to have the necessary support for active digitizers for good palm rejection to work and for enough accuracy for handwriting </s>
<s> then you are going to re discover the truth about this one </s>
<s> hopefully you don t get too upset later </s>
<s> it s odd to see you write about handwriting recognition </s>
<s> that is since when was it a digitizer issue </s>
<s> or palm rejection </s>
<s> you seem to write as if you are new to all this </s>
<s> i fear you would buy such a thing and then write blogs or facebook how bad it is </s>
<s> avoid all this and get out there and use these things </s>
<s> then you will find out exactly why i have written the above </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the usual google nexus 7 transformer tf300t with dock other pads </s>
<s> and the office plunked down an asus x202e but not one would be my idea of what would be needed to meet your requirement </s>
<s> none have the 16 hour battery time we need to begin and not one has progressed to the point i would call handwriting to text conversion worthy of use </s>
<s> notetaking </s>
<s> sure </s>
<s> but unless you are doing this you may be seeing the promises and not the reality </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t want it to try to recognize my handwriting and convert it to text </s>
<s> i want it to keep it the way it is but i need it to follow the pen more closely than a passive stylus would </s>
<s> i expect it to be difficult to adjust to and have imperfect accuracy but i also expect it to be usable for a first timer like myself </s>
<s> i don t see where you re going with this </s>
<s> i have a budget of 900 for the hybrid plus accessories which is why i m looking at the atom based ones </s>
<s> i don t need 16 hours but if i did i d stick to the asus vivotab tf810c plus keyboard dock or the latitude 10 plus 4 cell battery </s>
<s> i didn t mention text conversion at all </s>
<s> atom based windows hybrid not android </s>
<s> it appears you are going to learn this the hard way </s>
<s> good hunting and come back in a few months with your experiences </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> 16 hours </s>
<s> i thought i covered why you need that </s>
<s> in just a year with these 300 cycle batteries you will have to replace the battery to keep that 8 hour usage per charge </s>
<s> i had hoped this simple explanation would suffice </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> quot text conversion quot is what you noted about </s>
<s> here s what you wrote gt quot writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus quot how else would one highlight a paragraph unless the app converted your writing into text </s>
<s> gt i have these things and have encountered too many students that thought all this was good to go </s>
<s> well the good to go part must be vendors and industry willing to take your money </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my reply was to share what we have at the office on hand beyond the others that have come and gone </s>
<s> i meant writing out my math as one thing and highlighting in digital textbooks as another </s>
<s> writing out my math requires my authentic handwriting to prove it s my work </s>
<s> i don t think it could recognize my poor handwriting anyways </s>
<s> i only need to have 7 hours for one school year </s>
<s> afterwards i won t need that much </s>
<s> if it halves in 2 years then it quarters in a year </s>
<s> one school year is about 2 3 of a year and 2 3 of 1 4 is 1 6 </s>
<s> 5 6 of 9 hours is 7 5 hours on a full charge the samsung ativ 500t would reach 6 7 of it s usable capacity at the end of the last day of high school </s>
<s> i don t see any user access to the battery so my bet is that it s a return to factory as you wear out the battery </s>
<s> gt about digitizer accuracy </s>
<s> i find in all the models with the usual touch sensor aka capacitive that a stylus works best and we have to write larger and shrink it later </s>
<s> again i am doing this but it appears you have yet to use these products </s>
<s> so here is how i would write on almost any of the usual tablets </s>
<s> 1 grab the stylus </s>
<s> 2 start the app natch </s>
<s> 3 get to where i need to write </s>
<s> 4 write at about 2 times the size i want and then use the note taking app s feature to shrink it to the good looking normal size </s>
<s> only those that have not used these devices would think they could write as if they were on college ruled paper </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the software available today is still not good enough to handle perfect conversion of written text or speech into a word document </s>
<s> i have always tried to find a good program out there and have yet to stumble across one </s>
<s> i recently purchased mac speech scribe and paid 150 for the latest version and it is still no good </s>
<s> it skips words and just cant grab ahold of what i am saying even when i do annunciate </s>
<s> does anyone have any suggestions of software they know works well and doesn t run into the same problems everyone has </s>
<s> i feel like i would have known by now if there was but if anyone has suggestions please share </s>
<s> note this post was edited by a forum moderator to remove signature link which are prohibited in the forums on 07 19 2013 at 1 58 pm pt </s>
<s> as i previously stated in reply to r proffitt i don t need or want to convert anything to digital text </s>
<s> being able to use an active digitizer requires more than the regular capacitive touchscreen </s>
<s> it also needs to have inductive input </s>
<s> that s the deal with the different kinds of digitizer pens </s>
<s> for example the dell xps 12 can use a digitizer but not an active digitizer because it only has capacitive input </s>
<s> but you ve lost me here </s>
<s> keep in mind i ve been around since the ge 210 and was part of a company that made a few light pens decades ago </s>
<s> to me any device that translates position into some x y and possibly z coordinates is in fact a digitizer </s>
<s> now with that out of the way i think you are asking what resolution these digitizers have </s>
<s> my answer is they are poor for drawing and do slightly better with a stylus </s>
<s> the samsung s note uses the active pen as well as the activ pc </s>
<s> you want to use a stylus so be sure to go for models that have such </s>
<s> this doesn t cure the other issues that will come back to haunt you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i d budget a new battery in a few years but with the s pen it probably will do what you want </s>
<s> you ve helped a lot with your information </s>
<s> i ve decided that i still need the trackpad so i m crossing the latitude 10 off the list </s>
<s> now all i have left to decide on is whether to get the samsung ativ 500t 9hr for 680 total or the asus vivotab tf810c 12hr for 900 total </s>
<s> if i calculate purely based on battery life they have almost the same value price </s>
<s> i m also about to order in some parts for a diy lithium ion battery pack 14 8v 9 6ah going through a car dc port and adapter for any device i choose </s>
<s> samsung 500t 64gb micro sdxc card screen protector penabled tablet eraser pen microsoft office 365 1 year key card total about 780 including shipping if someone can beat this for a tablet hybrid with long battery life active digitizer and windows os please share </s>
