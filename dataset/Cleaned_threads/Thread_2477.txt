<s> i was shopping around for a new 19 quot lcd and wanted a decent resopnse time for gaming </s>
<s> i hit best buy to touch feel and saw the viewsonic vx910 for 449 00 and thought hmmm but a 25ms response time would not cut it in counterstike source so i went online and saw on the viewsonic web site the vx910 has a 16 ms response time hmm </s>
<s> i went back to bb and called viewsonic from there any lcd made after december is 16 ms i gave them the serial number of the model on display it was 25 and then the one from the box i was to buy and yippie it was 16 </s>
<s> so for that price i am happy </s>
<s> any just an fyi for any gamers looking for a good lcd 19 quot it is so sweet </s>
<s> see the samsung 915n 8 ms and great price </s>
<s> i was personally gonna say 16ms is still pretty high </s>
