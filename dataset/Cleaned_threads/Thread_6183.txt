<s> the only way we can use our motorola router is unencrypted </s>
<s> i have gone into the router numerous times and reset it unplugged it retyped the wep key tried to shift to wpa and nothing works </s>
<s> none of three computers in the house will connect unless all encryption is off </s>
<s> we live in a good neighborhood on a cul de sac don t get a lot of traffic through here and know the immediate neighbors but nothing is stopping a stranger with a laptop from sitting on the street and using our wifi </s>
<s> i ve talked to the comcast tech </s>
<s> the trouble just seems to be our boxes won t get past the wep encryption stage </s>
<s> has anyone had this problem </s>
<s> motorola has both a modem router and a stand alone wireless router which one do you have and what is the model number </s>
<s> but it was when my ssid was odd or i tried to use mac filtering too </s>
<s> tell more </s>
<s> it s the surfboard sbg900 router and modem </s>
<s> my ssid is one simple word </s>
<s> sorry but i would need to know all 20 settings to see if that s it </s>
<s> i never set up mac filtering </s>
<s> default is no filtering yes </s>
<s> as the makers can change anything if we can t see all settings we ll have to go with bum router </s>
<s> it could be as simple as the old hidden ssid issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my computer finds my strong router signal when instructed to search for wireless networks within range then lists two from my neighbors with weak or non existent signal </s>
<s> two boxes in the house run just fine on wireless with no encryption </s>
<s> but as it stands everything points to bad setting or bum router </s>
