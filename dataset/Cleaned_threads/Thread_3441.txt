<s> my latest attemplt to install realtek ac 97 whql driver onto a dell dimension 3000 always results in a blue screen of death due to device driver conflict </s>
<s> i downloaded the newest version of the driver from realtek website </s>
<s> during installation it says if i want to continue since this driver is not digitally signed by realtek </s>
<s> having read the read me on realtek website i clicked continue anyway </s>
<s> it continues for a little more and then gives me a blue screen of death </s>
<s> attempts to try different drivers does not help </s>
<s> my windows xp home installation was new </s>
<s> what can be the cause of the problem </s>
<s> you should use dell s version </s>
<s> i wasn t about to read all of them </s>
<s> dim_audio submitted true q dimension 3000 x 2 y 9 target _blank rel nofollow dim_audio submitted true q dimension 3000 x 2 y 9 and life goes on jack </s>
<s> i don t have the discs of the driver </s>
<s> search the service tag on dell website brings up nothing to download from not a single driver </s>
<s> where can i get it then </s>
<s> also i believe the board is what makes the difference </s>
<s> using software like everest i know that the board is intel with 865gv chipset </s>
<s> so i go to intel website to get the lastest driver </s>
<s> all the drivers work perfectly except for the ac97 which cause bsod on installation </s>
<s> what should i do next </s>
<s> well another look at dell website </s>
<s> this time i do a search on dimension 3000 and it comes up with drivers for download </s>
<s> however in audio section the driver is not for realtek ac97 </s>
<s> i wonder what can be the case </s>
<s> nevetheless my trouble is pretty much solve </s>
<s> my friend put in the recovery cd from dell which he got from another computer and reinstall everything again </s>
<s> then somehow the drivers work </s>
<s> now i don t understand what is the cause of my prior annoyance </s>
<s> oh well guess that is what i get for not using a mac </s>
