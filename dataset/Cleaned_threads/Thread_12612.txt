<s> i am having trouble finding the netbook i want </s>
<s> i want the 1001 but i cannot find this model with windows xp and 11hr battery life </s>
<s> i even found a website that sells the model with xp and 6 cell but claims its only 5 hour battery life but all other sites claim its 3 cell with 4 5 to 3 hr battery life </s>
<s> why do i have to sacrifice 7 to 8 hours battery life to have xp besides wouldnt u get even more battery life with xp running and the battery that comes with windows 7 version </s>
<s> i look at such laptops and find 300 cycle batteries so in about 1 year that 11 hours usually is 1 2 that if the owner is charging the battery at night and using it on battery during the day </s>
<s> and if this is so important why not install xp yourself </s>
<s> in fact i have begun to cycle out all old xp machines from the office </s>
<s> can t imagine keeping xp around with all the good stuff we have in 7 today </s>
<s> and no </s>
<s> we don t have any title or hardware we found to quot require xp quot bob </s>
<s> my intentions are to charge correctly i understand how important it is to not leave the charger plugged in for more than it requires battery memory </s>
<s> even if i were to charge incorrectly and in about a year my battery charge is only half of what it should be then that would be an even more reason to get a longer battery life a battery with 4 hours becomes 2 hours after a year vs a battery with 11 hours becomes 5 5 hours after a year thats a huge diff </s>
<s> as far as xp i read somewhere that you cant install xp after windows 7 has been installed dont know why or how it makes sense even if it is possible to install xp thats extra cash that i dont have to purchase xp </s>
<s> i wouldnt mind going with the 1005 or any asus netbook that is around 300 00 and has a 8 to 11 hour battery life but i cant find any that has xp if it does it has a 3 to 4 hour battery life </s>
<s> given the charging is done by the charging circuits i can t see how you could incorrectly charge the battery </s>
<s> it seems you are readying laptop battery advice from bad old nicad days </s>
<s> those are long gone </s>
<s> yes i have installed xp after vista </s>
<s> after 7 after linux and before each of those </s>
<s> it makes you wonder why there is any doubt here </s>
<s> yes installing windows can tax those that don t do it often </s>
<s> but back to xp </s>
<s> why go with such an old os </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i bought an asus k52jr it only have a 3 hour battery life it not that great to be carrying the charger all the time </s>
<s> laptops from just a few years ago regularly had little more the 2 hours of battery time </s>
<s> but a warning </s>
<s> most batteries are 300 cycle affairs </s>
<s> you are paying dearly for running on battery power </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hey why dont you try this asus netbook lu s670b 133 the best part is intel atom n270 1 6ghz processor with intel atom n270 1 6ghz processor with 512kb l2 cache 533mhz fsb i have been using it since last1 year and found it really good </s>
<s> first of all remember that 11 hours doesn t actually mean 11 hours probably 8 if you re lucky and thats at unboxing it will just get worse </s>
<s> if battery life is so important then i have seen batteries for 9 cell asus eee 1001 on amazon ca for 30 plus shipping 40 in total </s>
