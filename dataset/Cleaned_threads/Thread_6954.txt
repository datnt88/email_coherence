<s> i am on a thinkpad running windows 2000 and over the past several months i ve had a problem with randomly stopping receiving packets </s>
<s> it happens both through the wireless and cabled connections and there is no specific activity that causes this to occur </s>
<s> the problem corrects itself and the machine starts receiving packets again after a period of time if i just let it sit </s>
<s> i can correct the problem manually by disconnecting and reconnecting the network connection </s>
<s> the problem usually happens after i ve been using the connection for 5 10 minutes </s>
<s> i can still send packets and the connection seems to be perfectly fine i just can t receive anything </s>
<s> does this sound familiar to anyone </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> at this point i have scanned for viruses and spyware and installed the latest crappy microsoft updates but neither fixed the problem </s>
<s> i would really appreciate any help </s>
<s> try i d note router and such firmware updates but your post told so little </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob i downloaded and ran the complete system scan from the link you provided </s>
<s> the problem persists </s>
<s> another symptom when i connect to a vpn the problem automatically occurs </s>
<s> as soon as i disconnect from the vpn i am able to receive packets again </s>
<s> it s a cable connection and i m using an rca dcm425 cable modem </s>
<s> the wireless router is a netgear mr814 but as i mentioned before this happens both on wireless and when i m physically connected </s>
<s> please let me know if there is any additional information that would be helpful </s>
<s> i really appreciate it </s>
<s> i can t tell </s>
<s> the router firmware version is noted as version 5 4_06 </s>
<s> got that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it is not fine without the router </s>
<s> if i plug directly into the cable modem it has the same problem </s>
<s> could it be some kind of dns problem </s>
<s> i know i m not very knowledgable about these things so i apologize if that is a silly question but when the connection craps out it seems like it sees the site if i m in a browser but can t manage to resolve it </s>
<s> it s like it gets tired of doing stuff for me so it takes a break and then it s fine again </s>
<s> hint google com and my email link in my profile </s>
<s> i ll give it the onceover for dns hijacks </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am having the same problem did you get a solution </s>
<s> the vpn </s>
<s> tell me about your vpn connection </s>
<s> if you don t have a vpn then it s not the same problem </s>
<s> i ve been telecommuting for several years and all of a sudden i m having this unstable vpn connection </s>
<s> the it department at work and my isp time warner both say nothing has changed on their end </s>
<s> it s a work issue and they need to get to the bottom of this </s>
<s> have them bring another laptop to your home and test with that </s>
<s> i have added instructions on my blog on how to fix this </s>
