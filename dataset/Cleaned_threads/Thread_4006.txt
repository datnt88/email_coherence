<s> currently i have an athlon xp 2000 cpu and 512mb pc2700 333mhz ram </s>
<s> i believe the cpu can only operate at the 233 fsb level </s>
<s> the mb is msi kt333 ultra </s>
<s> i am looking to upgrade without upgrading the motherboard which can support upto xp 2700 </s>
<s> would it be worth the money to upgrade to the athlon 2700 xp cpu and 1gb ram </s>
<s> to first spend the money on a better mobo and get like a 3000 or 3200 processor </s>
<s> i would leave the ram for a later time </s>
<s> fyi i have a 2000xp with 512mb it will do a seti unit in 4 5 hours </s>
<s> i also have a 2700xp with 1gb it will do a seti unit 3 4 hours </s>
<s> so draw you own conclusion </s>
