<s> hi everybody here is the scenario i was trying to remove the pre installed windows 8 i figured i should create a backup in case i ever have to go back to the piece of junk software </s>
<s> anyway i plugged in my external hard drive to make the backup here s the ck up it said formatting drive </s>
<s> within two seconds i cancelled the operation and removed the hard drive </s>
<s> now when i try to access it tried on 3 other laptops it just shows the hard drive as recovery disk with some 20mb data and total 30 gb space </s>
<s> disk management shows 890 gb unallocated space </s>
<s> it s a seagate 1tb backup drive </s>
<s> there was nearly 500 gb of data on it </s>
<s> do i need to use some data recovery program or is there another way </s>
<s> i don t think an entire hard drive can be formatted in 2 seconds </s>
<s> can someone please help </s>
<s> i can t stress enough how important the data on the drive is to me </s>
<s> regards stished </s>
<s> let me start repeating the start of my previous post for another member quot your story proves 2 well known things 1 external hard disks aren t suitable for data storage just for transport and backup 2 if you have only one copy of data no backup you risk to lose it that s a calculated risk if the time to make a backup is more than the time to make the documents again quot with that being said all i can say more is that the top post in this forum mentions a lot of free and paid recovery programs </s>
<s> some might work </s>
<s> you only know when you try </s>
<s> it s recommended to make a clone of the disk on another 1 tb disk and let the recovery programs work on that clone </s>
<s> that way the first one you try won t do things that would interfere with the workings of the second one </s>
<s> but if the data on the drive are really important i wouldn t use the diy programs but find a professional data recovery company to do it </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks kees will keep a backup of the backup in future however do you think i really need to use a data recovery software </s>
<s> is there something else that can be done surely 1 tb can t be formatted in 2 seconds </s>
<s> maybe there is another solution </s>
<s> regards stished </s>
<s> that s the diy software in that top post </s>
<s> if formatting starts with the fat or the directory you can clear a lot in 2 seconds </s>
<s> and although the data is still on the disk it s kind of a puzzle to find it </s>
<s> that s what that recovery software does </s>
<s> kees </s>
