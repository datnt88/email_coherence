<s> i have previously burned a dvd rw verbatin with all of my downloaded software installation programs </s>
<s> the dvd was previously udf formatted using incd version 4 3 23 2 i have previously used the dvd rw to write to and retrieve files </s>
<s> this time i loaded the dvd in my drive to extract one of the files and the computer rebooted every time that i tried </s>
<s> ultimately i got an error message telling me that there was a critical error on the disk and the disk would be marked as read only to protect the data </s>
<s> however there appears to be nothing on the dvd now </s>
<s> when i insert it in the dvd drive it seems to be labeled quot incd auto formattable quot i ve tried to read the dvd on 2 computers with the same results </s>
<s> does anyone know how i can retrieve the lost data </s>
<s> 1 incd should be installed to read it </s>
<s> yes it s not required according to some but my experience is otherwise </s>
<s> 2 go use your backup copy </s>
<s> dvdrw disks are all of 1 dollar here </s>
<s> i hope your files were worth that much </s>
<s> in closing isobuster has worked sometimes to get the files out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for your reply </s>
<s> if you are inferring that i should have backed up the dvd </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i know that it would have been a good idea to have 2 copies of the dvd but i didn t </s>
<s> i did try isobuster and it merely reported that the dvd was a blank disk </s>
<s> it is my understanding that on a hard drive even if the file allocation table is damaged or erased that a disk recovery tool can restore files </s>
<s> i m assuming that something like that happened to my dvd rw </s>
<s> are there any other ideas </s>
<s> but there are copies of said files back on the machine you made the dvdrw on </s>
<s> time to go get those </s>
<s> a recurring lesson is that if you want to lose files make sure there is only one copy on one quot thing quot gt next up </s>
<s> go get zero assumption recovery and getdataback and see what they think </s>
<s> if blank then it s likely that you can send it to drivesavers and for a few hundred they ll see what can be done </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks again bob first on the backup strategy the files on the dvd that i m trying to recover are original installation programs that were downloaded from the internet </s>
<s> these programs are installed and working on my computer but the installation programs are not on the computer hdd </s>
<s> they only existed on the dvd </s>
<s> and yes </s>
<s> it is a lesson </s>
<s> that being said i tried both zero assumption recovery and getdataback </s>
<s> unless i totally screwed up these programs will only recover data from a fat or ntfs file system disk </s>
<s> in fact zero assumption recovery wouldn t even recognize my dvd drive </s>
<s> the dvd in question was udf formatted using nero incd </s>
<s> i previously did a search on quot udf data recovery quot and found a couple of shareware programs that claim to recover data from a udf disk but they failed too </s>
<s> it looks like it s lost cause </s>
<s> i ll put the experience quot in the bank quot and learn from it </s>
<s> thank you again for your help </s>
