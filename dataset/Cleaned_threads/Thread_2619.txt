<s> i am looking to upgrade my printer specifically to improve photo printing </s>
<s> can someone explain the different between hp s photosmart and photoret iv printing </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> photosmart is the brand of the printers photoret is the technology in the printers </s>
<s> with photoret 4 you get improved print quality with your pictures lasting up to 65 years </s>
<s> if you find one with photoret pro it has the option to use 8 ink printing ret4 only uses a 6 ink </s>
<s> the extra two inks dramatically increase quality of colour if your doing black and white printing </s>
<s> they are greyscale printing </s>
<s> with pro photos last up to 73 years </s>
<s> the drops of ink are smaller with photoret 4 than previous versions so you get better quality and colour </s>
<s> i work for hp so any other questions you have fell free to ask and i can answer them </s>
<s> thanks scorcher that is perfect i think photoret iv is best for me as i don t print black and white photos </s>
<s> scorcher since you work for hp i am looking at the 8150 and the 8450 could you describe the key differences i would notice and whether the 50 price difference is worth it for the 8450 </s>
<s> any thoughts would be great </s>
<s> thanks </s>
