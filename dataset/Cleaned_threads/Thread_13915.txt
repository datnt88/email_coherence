<s> hello everyone </s>
<s> i think i have thought of a way to backup my current hdd </s>
<s> would it be possible to buy a dvd writer put all my data on dvds install the new hdd and put files on </s>
<s> but don t dvds only hold video files </s>
<s> i have a 9 39gb hdd and i am going to upgrade to 80gb hdd </s>
<s> i am using a desktop pc </s>
<s> all suggestions appreciated larry </s>
<s> anything you want to put on them not just movies </s>
<s> might also consider going to 120gb they re almost same price as then 80gb and they re under the size limit where almost any os would recognize the full capacity see 48bitlba com </s>
<s> check over at newegg com they ve got a wide selection of hdds and and dvd burner s </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i d just install the os and everything else on the new hd and forget about the old 10gb clunker </s>
<s> it ll be faster and quieter </s>
<s> you can put any type of file on a dvd as long as it fits </s>
<s> there are good dual layer dvd burners read and write to both cd s and dvd s for less than 40 online </s>
<s> what is your computer manufacturer name and model </s>
<s> what operating system </s>
<s> my system details are hp vectra vl400 dt windows 2000 sp3 but i will probably upgrade to xp sp2 pentium iii processor </s>
<s> you should be ok with a 120gb hard drive or smaller </s>
<s> the issue of hard drives larger than 137gb your motherboard may not support newer ultra ata hard drives ata 66 100 133 so you may have to add an ata 100 133 hard disk controller card to a pci slot </s>
<s> something like one of these also make sure you use an 80 wire not 40 wire ultra ata data cable </s>
<s> see the pictures here the maker of your new hd has a free utility to transfer the image of the old hd directly to the new one </s>
<s> this is much quicker than reinstalling the os drivers os patches software and personal files </s>
<s> however if i haven t performed a fresh installation of everything in years i like to take the opportunity of a new hd to do just that </s>
<s> it eliminates a lot of junk and fixes corrupt system files </s>
<s> remember to implement your plan to backup all important file to cd or dvd before you try any of these solutions </s>
