<s> i am having trouble with the axim </s>
<s> if you bump the back side of the axim it gives a screen that says that the battery latch has been opened or sometimes shuts off and will not start again for awhile </s>

<s> i can t help but bump it on the back as i use the device to tune pianos and must have the device sitting on the piano </s>
<s> it only takes the slightest bump to make it malfunction </s>
<s> you call its maker to get it fixed </s>
<s> there is so little we can do or replace short of the battery that you know where to go next </s>
