<s> i have a viewsonic p95f monitor </s>
<s> 19 quot crt i keep the brightness at medium level but it regularly goes darker grey washed out and it gets harder to read the print seems blurry </s>
<s> i haven t nailed down a pattern but i d say every 15 20 minutes or so </s>
<s> it lasts 1 10 minutes then goes back to my regular brightness </s>
<s> the monitor is probably 5 7 years old but i ve had no problems until now </s>
<s> i recently put in a new power supply and graphics card in my pc but i can t say if this started before or after those changes </s>
<s> could this be a problem with a driver the graphics card power supply or is it just time to get a new monitor </s>
<s> any tips on how to diagnose </s>
<s> thanks eddie </s>
<s> look on the back for the manufacture date but you can t get these fixed for less than a new monitor </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> imo it was terrific especially the small text </s>
<s> it had so many adjustments to perfect the image and the crt was rock stable </s>
<s> and speaking of rock it was as heavy as boulder </s>
<s> i gave mine up recently for an lcd though my vs was still working ok sort of </s>
<s> it was fading and the picture shrinking slowly </s>
<s> as well it s weight was slowly warping my tabletop which is a full inch thick </s>
<s> my best advice is to get rid of it or live with it as is </s>
<s> i could suggest removing the housing cleaning out the dust and spiders and reseating all the connections you can find but such can lead to shocking experiences if you don t know how to bleed the high voltage from the envelope and what to stay clear of </s>
<s> i m happy with my lcd but the old vs is now my standard in monitor performance </s>
