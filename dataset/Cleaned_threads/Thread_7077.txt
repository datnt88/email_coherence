<s> hi i ve done some research on this but nothing seems to be working </s>
<s> i have a wireless home network set up with one desktop and a few laptops connecting to the wireless router </s>
<s> i m having internet connection problems with one of the laptops all the rest work just fine </s>
<s> i ve connected to the wireless network however can t connect to the internet </s>
<s> i manually added the ip address and dns server to the network connection to access the network but it still won t connect to the internet although it says i m connected to the network supposedly </s>
<s> i m running xp on the laptop which cannot connect the other computers are either xp or vista </s>
<s> the wireless router i use is dlink di 524 </s>
<s> i ran an ipconfig all on the affected computer dhcp is enabled ip address is 192 168 0 1 with the default gateway and dns server the same as the ip address </s>
<s> i got the numbers to manually add from other computers connected to the network </s>
<s> i ve tried pinging too </s>
<s> i ve gotten ip addresses to work but not url s </s>
<s> i m not sure what other information is needed but let me know </s>
<s> the laptop has previously been connected to this network so i m not sure why now it is not connecting to the internet and i have to manually add everything </s>
<s> i ve checked hosts file too </s>
<s> thanks for any help you can give as i m at a loss for what to do next </s>
<s> your gateway and dns server should not be the same address </s>
<s> the router lan ip is the gateway </s>
<s> the dns server comes from the wan side </s>
<s> it would be your isp server address but you don t generally need to plug that in </s>
<s> i would start by trying to connect the wired port and get it working first </s>
<s> this can help rule out some issues with the laptop </s>
<s> for wifi i rarely find that to work </s>
<s> go back to dhcp now </s>
<s> also let s say this is a cable modem </s>
<s> be sure when switching to the router from a direct connection to power down the cable modem move the ethernet to the router then power up the cable modem </s>
<s> why this is needed is written about widely </s>
<s> i ll stop here with one more admonishment </s>
<s> use our forum sticky for setup of the router </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had the same problem occur before christmas where my wireless laptop was connected to my home network but not connecting to the internet </s>
<s> i had to do the following 1 open network connections 2 right click on local area connection and choose properties 3 click on advanced tab 4 uncheck box under internet connection sharing next to allow other network users to connect through this computer s internet connection this resolved the problem since i was able to successfully ping everything </s>
