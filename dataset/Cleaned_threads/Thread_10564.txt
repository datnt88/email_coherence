<s> hi folks i have a problem with my lan </s>
<s> it worked fine until i moved a computer to another room and tried to resume the net </s>
<s> nothing works </s>
<s> one computer recognizes one other but the other two won t recognize either </s>
<s> someone suggested i disable the firewall which i did but no help </s>
<s> he also suggested i ping but i don t know how to do this </s>
<s> i have run thru the set up procedure many times and tried all the different ways </s>
<s> i m using a netgear model fs605 if any more info is needed please let me know and i ll try to furnish it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> are you using norton security center </s>
<s> if so disable the whole suite and see if you can see the other computers </s>
<s> if not check the workgroup names to ensure they are the same </s>
<s> if you re running windows 2000 or xp on the machines you can pull up the command prompt by choosing quot run quot from the start menu typing quot cmd quot and clicking quot ok quot </s>
<s> from the command prompt you can type quot ipconfig quot to view the computer s ip address or quot ping lt address gt quot to ping another computer </s>
<s> first use ipconfig to determine the ip address of each system and write them all down the ip address should begin with quot 10 quot or quot 192 168 quot as a side note your default gateway should begin with the same digits and generally end in quot 1 quot </s>
<s> the ip addresses of the computers should be the same except for the last octet i e </s>
<s> 192 168 1 2 192 168 1 3 etc </s>
<s> if they re different 192 168 0 2 192 168 1 3 10 0 100 2 then you have a configuration problem </s>
<s> if any computer has an ip address beginning with quot 169 quot this is a default windows assigned address which indicates that the system can t talk to your router to get an ip address </s>
<s> provided all the ips are correct go to each computer and try to ping all the other computers for example if computer b is quot 192 168 1 3 quot you would go to computer a and type quot ping 192 168 1 3 quot and hit enter </s>
<s> you should get four lines beginning with quot reply from 192 168 1 3 quot if you get quot request timed out quot quot destination net unreachable quot or another error either something s not connected or one of the computers isn t configured properly </s>
<s> if you are getting quot request timed out quot it may indicate the windows firewall or another security program is active check the security center in each computer s control panel quot windows firewall quot should be off even though it will complain that it s not recommended your router is acting as a firewall and makes the windows firewall redundant and next to useless </s>
<s> please reply and let me know if these tips helped </s>
<s> if you still aren t able to connect let me know what your ping responses error messages were and i can try to help you out some more </s>
<s> netgear normally provides their own drivers </s>
<s> did you try to reinstall them </s>
