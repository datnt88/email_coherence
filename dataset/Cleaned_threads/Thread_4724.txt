<s> having problems establishing wpa encryption on wireless network </s>
<s> router is netgear wpn824 </s>
<s> desktop running xp media w sp2 is hardwired and encryption seems to have taken using netgear wizard </s>
<s> desktop running xp home w sp2 is wireless using netgear wpn111 usb connection </s>
<s> problem using netgear wizard i tried to enable wpa encryption with code same as one used on wired desktop </s>
<s> wireless computer is active on the network when i start but when i apply the wpa encryption the wizard goes red and the network drops out </s>
<s> seems to be searching for a connection </s>
<s> i tried applying the encryption with the windows firewall disabled but it does not take </s>
<s> note i also tried to set up wep but same problem other info wireless system uses nsw 2005 antivirus along with aluria adware software </s>
<s> any thoughts on what s going on here and how to correct this </s>
<s> i talked with netgear and they said drop all firewalls and uninstall the software if necessary </s>
<s> call back if any problems </s>
<s> once i get the issue fixed i ll be ready to review netgear products for all to see </s>
<s> had similar issues until i updated my not a netgear routers firmware </s>
<s> finally it works proper </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> your wireless wpn111 usb is not compatible with wpa or you need to update your firmware </s>
<s> well i had a brain cramp when i set things up </s>
<s> i did not set the router up for wpa encryption first </s>
<s> for those interested here s what i did </s>
<s> i went to the router wpn824 setup configuration screen and set up encryption for wpa accessing it through my wired computer </s>
<s> funny thing after i did this the wireless computer dropped out as it wasn t set up for encryption since i was having problems as previously described </s>
<s> i then set up the wireless wpn111 usb adapter for wpa encryption and all seems fine now </s>
<s> funny how the netgear tech did not bother to run down the setup sequence and figure this out </s>
<s> seems he must have assumed that i set up the router via the wired computer already but that wouldn t have made sense the wireless computer had access without encryption </s>
