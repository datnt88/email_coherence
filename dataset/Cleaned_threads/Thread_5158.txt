<s> i had exactly the same problem with two laptops i had networked previously using a wired connection </s>
<s> after changing to a wireless connection with belkin router and network card i had no end of trouble sharing files </s>
<s> i got into no end of a mess trying to make it work and eventually couldn t even access some folders on one machine on or off the network </s>
<s> i took my usual step when nothing else seems to work and formatted both machines and started again </s>
<s> making sure they both had the same workgroup names was all i needed to do other than running the xp network quot wizard quot to make it all work perfectly </s>
<s> i concluded there must have been some conflict with the original wired setup </s>
