<s> i have a trendnet wireless router and my desktop is connected to the router with a cable </s>
<s> i had an old laptop with a trendnet pc card and my speeds were great </s>
<s> the problem is with my new laptop </s>
<s> i no longer have the old laptop </s>
<s> my new laptop has a broadcom internal wireless adapter and the speeds are really slow </s>
<s> i did not change anything i just took my new laptop out of the box and connected it to my wireless network </s>
<s> when i connect the laptop with a cable the speeds are good </s>
<s> i am using channel 6 with wep and pka enabled </s>
<s> as far as i know there are no wireless networks close to my home </s>
<s> i am not sure why the new laptop is so slow on the network compared to the old one </s>
<s> even transfering files from my desktop to the laptop is really slow </s>
<s> any help would be apprecated </s>
<s> i think you may have a defect wireless adapter </s>
<s> because you said when you connected with cable speed is good </s>
<s> one thing you can check </s>
<s> go to my computer properties </s>
<s> select hardware </s>
<s> select device manger </s>
<s> double click on network adapter </s>
<s> double click on wireless adapter and check on device status </s>
<s> it should say device is working properly </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> please let us know </s>
<s> if you solve this problem </s>
<s> how far is the laptop away from wireless router </s>
<s> is your wireless router support 802 11b g </s>
<s> is your wireless adapter support 802 11b g </s>
<s> in my case the router s firmware was at issue </s>
<s> the update corrected something to allow my laptop to run at the higher 802 11g speed </s>
<s> that issue drives people nuts since they think it s the laptop since the old laptop worked bob </s>
<s> yes the wireless adapter says that it is working correctly </s>
<s> i tried the laptop all over the house from right beside the router to 3 floors away </s>
<s> both support b g </s>
<s> i ve had these symptoms several times myself and it has always been fixed using one of two methods 1 update your router s firmware </s>
<s> you should be able to do this by downloading the firmware update from the manufacturer s website and then accessing the update firmware option through your router s administration tools </s>
<s> the details of this vary by brand model and since i ve never worked with yours i m not sure about it </s>
<s> 2 update the drivers for the wireless card on your laptop </s>
<s> just because the laptop is new does not mean the drivers are up to date </s>
<s> quite the contrary actually </s>
<s> to do this go to the laptop manufacture s website and find the drivers for your model </s>
<s> i emphisise that it is the laptop manufacturer because they often have different drivers that setup for your laptop s specific configuration this is assuming the card came with was built into the laptop otherwise go to the card manufacturer </s>
<s> download the drivers and install as is instructed intuitive </s>
<s> make sure you do both of these </s>
<s> i beleive there was an update change to standards a while back so if the router and card are out of sync as far as standards go there will be improper connecetions and hence terrible speeds </s>
<s> best of luck toby </s>
<s> ok i will check with trendnet to see how to update the firmware </s>
<s> i guess i have some work to do tonight </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> ok there was not a firmware update for the router but there was a driver update for the laptop </s>
<s> however this did not fix my problem </s>
<s> i changed channels and that also didn t work </s>
<s> so i decided to turn off security and set a mac filter </s>
<s> guess what </s>
<s> that fixed the problem </s>
<s> i am not sure if this is the best solution or why the security was slowing me down so much but everything is working fine now </s>
<s> my dlink 524 did the same thing </s>
<s> later dlink issued yet another firmware update and now wep doesn t incur a slowdown </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what model number is your router </s>
<s> it is a trendnet tew 432 brp </s>
<s> my speed is good but i keep losing my connection for no reason </s>
<s> when i reconnect it works fine for a while then it s gone again </s>
<s> having same issue </s>
<s> using tew 631brp and pc card tew 621pc </s>
<s> losing connection </s>
<s> did you figure out how to fix this </s>
