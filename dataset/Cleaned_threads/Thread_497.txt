<s> hey ppl i need help setting up a network printer between my desktop which is running windows xp and my laptop which is running windows vista </s>
<s> do i to download a printer driver on my laptop or is there an easy way in the settings somewhere </s>
<s> please ppl help me out and also the printer i want to put on a network is an older one so it s not a usb printer its that older bigger clunkier kind of ports into the desktop pc </s>
<s> please help ppl </s>
<s> you said you wanted to network a printer </s>
<s> by this do you mean share it on a network or have it on the network via a print server </s>
<s> sharing requires the host device to be on all the time for printing to happen </s>
<s> a printer on a print server is available to any pc with a driver for it and the tcp ip port created </s>
<s> hi thanks for replying </s>
<s> i am not very technical with this but basically i want to be able to connect my laptop to the main desktop s printer but i don t want to connect my printer through the internet if that is what you mean by being connected all the time </s>
<s> i know my response is very vague but you can either ask me further to clarify what exactly i want or if it s not much trouble you can just post the solutions and instructions for going about setting up the network printer with a heading for each network printer solution step by step and numbered steps </s>
<s> thanks again for replying </s>
<s> first you have to network the two pcs </s>
<s> this will require some hardware </s>
<s> the best way would be through a hub or switch using ethernet cable </s>
<s> what we don t know yet is what sort of networking hardware you already have </s>
<s> do you have a broadband internet service </s>
<s> if so are you using a router </s>
<s> if you have a router that s a big help as you re two pcs will need ip addresses to communicate </s>
<s> if you don t have broadband internet and just want the two pcs networked you do that with a single quot crossover quot type ethernet cable and set your ip addresses manually </s>
<s> in any event you need to get them networked first and make sure quot printer and file sharing quot is turned on </s>
<s> next you decide which pc will have the printer attached </s>
<s> you will install the printer driver attach the printer and test it </s>
<s> you will need to share that printer </s>
<s> if you do a right click on the printer icon that been created you should see an option to share it </s>
<s> select that option and an up raised palm should appear under it </s>
<s> now when you browse the network from the other pc it will look for shares </s>
<s> the printer should be one of them </s>
<s> a right click on the shared printer should bring up an option to install it </s>
<s> sometimes this doesn t work </s>
<s> another way would be to use the quot add printer quot option which will allow you to browse to the same printer across the network and install from there </s>
<s> it s probable you ll need a different printer driver for this pc than the other because the operating systems are not the same </s>
<s> you ll need to have that driver handy </s>
<s> admittedly it s been a while since i ve done printer sharing set up and it s not always possible to know what to expect when two different oss are involved </s>
<s> but that s basically how you d do printer sharing </s>
<s> first network the pcs install the printer one one and share it and then make the connection from the other pc </s>
