<s> this morning i booted up my pc and the keyboard mouse wi fi and sound card do not work </s>
<s> i have checked the bios and all usb functioning is correct </s>
<s> when i load my windows recovery disk both my keyboard and mouse work </s>
<s> so there is no hardware problem </s>
<s> i have run start up repair many times with no success </s>
<s> win7 will boot to desktop but all devices fail </s>
<s> i have renamed my c windows info to ink bak and replaced it with an info folder from my wife s working pc </s>
<s> this did not work </s>
<s> please help me </s>
<s> why isn t the usual system restore to a prior date an option and choice </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> devices </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> hi and thank you for your help </s>
<s> windows has very unhelpfully deleted all my system restore points </s>
<s> even tho i gave system protection 25 of my 1tb hard drive to use it still deleted the restore points </s>
<s> i even kept back up restores on another hard drive which have also been removed by win7 </s>
<s> no devices connected to the computer work </s>
<s> all the usbs are dead as is the wi fi and the sound card </s>
<s> there is no way for me to access the device manager even tho win7 has booted up </s>
<s> i have tried to boot in safe mode but just the same no mouse or keyboard </s>
<s> both the mouse and the keyboard work and are recognised when the windows dvd boots into recovery </s>
<s> bios recognises the keyboard and the mouse and they both light up before windows starts </s>
<s> imediately after the bios check finishes and win7 begins to boot both are deactivated </s>
<s> apologies for the bad typing in my original post </s>
<s> i was usinjg my xoom which has a handy spellchecker </s>
<s> the files i renamed and coped were the c windows inf </s>
<s> does safe mode work </s>
<s> hi r profitt thank you for your help </s>
<s> i can start in safe mode but win7 has the same problem and disables the mouse and keyboard so that i cannot achieve anything </s>
<s> i d thought of editing the registry in safe mode to see if that would have helped but i cannot </s>
<s> i ve also tested all the usb slots when win7 boots and they re all dead </s>
<s> no matter which ones i plug my keyboard and mouse in to they do not work </s>
<s> interestingly the cd dvd drive seems to be recognized in this state </s>
<s> if i put a disc in i get the normal pop up with the options to open and examine the files </s>
<s> this all seemed to happen yesterday after i tried to jailbreak my iphone </s>
<s> i m sure this is a coincidence as i continued the process with my wife s pc and succeeded </s>
<s> more work than a startup repair but it should help </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> hi kees and thank you for your help </s>
<s> i was dreading that due to the info on the hard drive </s>
<s> so what i ve done it to order a new hard drive from amazong a cost of 163 50 thanks to windows 7 s failure </s>
<s> i ll do a clean install onto that and use the current one as storage </s>
