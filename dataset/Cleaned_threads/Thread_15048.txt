<s> will use one of the major brand dlink linksys a g 2 4ghz 5ghz wireless router with 4 port switch and entry point </s>
<s> want both frequencies </s>
<s> want 5 ghz but be able to fall back to 2 4 ghz for more range </s>
<s> only two computers involved but one is in a trailer on the other side of a wide paved driveway and handicapped parking area a municipal bldg for road maintenance trucks graders et al running cables would be too difficult we added a new function and employee but had no space for an office thus the trailer lol telephone company refused to drop a phone line to it says that pa law does not allow drops to two places on one property </s>
<s> thus his phone line comes into our building and we have the base station for a 2 4 ghz phone and he has an additional phone with charger </s>
<s> it works fine </s>
<s> one reason i might need 5 ghz for the network to prevent interference </s>
<s> the router will sit in a window in the main building with a clear shot to the windows in the trailer </s>
<s> about 120 feet </s>
<s> if necesary the computer s location in the trailer can to optimized for the antenna on the pci slot </s>
<s> unless there are extension antennas </s>
<s> plenty of info on the 2 4 b or g units but not much on the a g </s>
<s> i know that there is a quot high quot gain antenna available for 2 4 but haven t seen one for 5 ghz </s>
<s> any ideas and also recco s on which brands based on experience </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> my tests with wap11 and wusb11 was right at the 300 foot mark with line of sight and setting the transfer rate to a fixed 1 mbps </s>
<s> remember that speed drops rapidly with distance </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you might try this supplier for 5ghz gain antennas </s>
