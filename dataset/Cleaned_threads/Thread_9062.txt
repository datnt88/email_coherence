<s> i have a desktop pc and my wife has a notebook set up on a home network i am curious to know why both machines dont get the same email messsages </s>
<s> both machines are turned on </s>
<s> do msgs not go to both machines on a network </s>
<s> thanks in advance virgil hummel </s>
<s> whichever account they are set to go to </s>
<s> iow you need to duplicate the email settings on each pc then leave a copy on the server for a specified time period so that each pc will pick up the messages when logged in </s>
<s> what do you mean quot leave a copy of settings on server quot </s>
<s> your server routinly </s>
<s> if you didn t do it then your mail server quota will be full </s>
<s> so it is better to configure it only on one pc </s>
<s> the configuration is on oe menu gt tools accounts click your account properties advance </s>
<s> to hold a copy for 5 days that s enough time for me </s>
<s> how it works is each pc when accessing oe will download any messages available </s>
<s> each pc will only download a particular email once </s>
<s> after 5 days for me the mail is removed from the server </s>
<s> the settings are where melati pointed </s>
