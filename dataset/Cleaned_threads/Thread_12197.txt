<s> hi there i am thinking of buying an old pii 133 laptop i will probably install win98 on it but it doesn t have usb port so i am wondering to xfer various files larger than 1 4 mb can i hook this thing up to my win 2000 machine via a parallel cable </s>
<s> and if so what do i need beyond the cable itself </s>
<s> will windows just start talking back and forth or do i need some software </s>
<s> speed is not a big issue here fj ps it has a quot irda 1 0 quot port whatever that is fj </s>
<s> documented at bob </s>
<s> the best s w to do this is called quot laplink quot which also includes the cable </s>
<s> older laplink s w ver </s>
<s> will do fine it seems too many bells and whisltes are part of the s w now and but check to be sure it will handle your os </s>
<s> win98 and above offer ms own quot dcc quot s w whcih does basically the same thing but very basic and that s ok for most users </s>
<s> that s installed from the os install cd from the add remove s w icon </s>
<s> you still need the laplink type cable parallel or serial links as required </s>
<s> the irda is quot infared connection quot ability </s>
<s> that s also possible if goping that route but it can be complex at times </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
