<s> my desktop hard drive recently failed and i need to purchase a new one </s>
<s> problem is i ve never replaced a hard drive before </s>
<s> my desktop s specifications are here what kind of hard drive should i purchase </s>
<s> will any sata hard drive be compatible with my computer </s>
<s> i can t afford something exceedingly expensive </s>
<s> space should be between 1 2 tb </s>
<s> would this work with my computer </s>
<s> thanks and sorry for all the links </s>
<s> hard drive 1 tb size 1 tb interface sata transfer rating 3 0 gb sec rotational speed 7200 rpm those are your specs above </s>
<s> they are for a sata type drive </s>
<s> you can install a 2 2tb no problem even a 3tb one if you like as your os is win7 will readily accept it </s>
<s> the hd link appears not to be an issue will work </s>
<s> however i do suggest you update the bios so it can accept any changes that hp provides or deems so </s>
<s> hp if you follow the instructions should provide info on os re install and hd replacement please review it for model or generic details </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i placed an order for the hard drive i linked to the caviar green one </s>
<s> it should be here within a few days </s>
<s> i couldn t find exact instructions on how to replace my old hard drive with the new one once i get it </s>
<s> there are a lot of tutorials online but a point in the right direction would be great </s>
<s> hopefully it all works out when i get my hd </s>
