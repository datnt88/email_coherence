<s> i have a large home with very thick walls </s>
<s> is it worth paying extra to buy a business grade wap such as the cisco aironet 1041n over a consumer grade router such as the e4200 </s>
<s> any thoughts or suggestions on other routers </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it will more than likely make no difference </s>
<s> almost all routers transmit at the legal maximum power </s>
<s> they all transmit and receive the data in exactly the same format </s>
<s> business equipment generally has features that would not be used by home users </s>
<s> things like multiple ssid and vlan support and radius support etc </s>
<s> one feature related to power is the ability to dynamically reduce the power to allow load sharing of users between groups of ap </s>
<s> the best solution to a house with thick wall is to use directional antenna </s>
<s> you concentrate the power in the direction of the walls </s>
<s> it is a trade off you will then get less signal in other directions </s>
<s> generally the best solutions to coverage issues is to run multiple routers </s>
<s> waps and wifi routers which i can configure to be a wap </s>
<s> are already at the max power allowed </s>
<s> i can only guess no one has shared this and the seller is more than willing to sell you anything without telling you this </s>
<s> why are the other solutions such as wifi routers configured as waps and ac power line networking not an option </s>
