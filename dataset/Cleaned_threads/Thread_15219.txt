<s> i just got a second monitor plug and play worked and was fine even though my main laptop was 1280 x 800 and the second screen is 1024 x 768 it went to sleep </s>
<s> i woke up my laptop and both screens showed the waking up loading windows then the second screen went black </s>
<s> before it still let me use the second screen even though i couldn t see anything now i can t extend to the second screen through display settings </s>
<s> if i try now the laptop seems to get set to the lowest display settings possible and the second screen stays dark </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> when this happens to me it s always the drivers </s>
<s> since it s a laptop your choices are limited but make sure you make a warranty claim if they don t support it by some driver on their web site </s>
<s> i just restarted my computer with the monitor unplugged plugged it back in after it was started and now the second monitor works fine again </s>
<s> but i feel like as soon as it falls asleep and i try to wake it up it s going to not want to wake up again </s>
<s> so it s not that it s not supported i think since it does work but it doesn t wake up after falling asleep </s>
<s> i ve seen other forum posts like this but there weren t answers to those either </s>
<s> laptops which you didn t give make or model are proprietary </s>
<s> you can make this a warranty claim now </s>
<s> i have no answers since there is so little to work with in your post </s>
<s> thus i only can share what it was for me most of the time </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have a gateway mt6840 and it says the display adapter is 945gm express chipset family </s>
<s> when the laptop went to sleep the second monitor could turn on again but when it hibernated the second monitor stayed off but was still there ie i could move my mouse onto it as well as other windows </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> also i m out of warranty since i got it over a year ago </s>
<s> i m always wondering why people leave out the make model in posts </s>
<s> why is that </s>
<s> gt but tell me what date driver you are using </s>
<s> i see the drivers at and the date looks to be 2 15 2008 </s>
<s> again for completeness i ll install the latest chipset and graphics drivers when i see this issue </s>
<s> your posts never revealed if you did that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so i tried downloading the driver update from 6 28 2008 from the intel site for my computer windows vista home premium 32bit edition </s>
<s> the first page of the installer said the drivers the installer updated and the 945gm express chipset family was included on the list </s>
<s> then setup quits saying quot the driver being installed is not validated for this computer </s>
<s> please obtain the appropriate driver from the computer s manufacturer quot hm but it says my driver is from 12 12 2006 and when i try to update it from the device manager and tell it to search the internet to find the upgrade it says that i already have the most up to date version </s>
<s> you have a very outdated driver </s>
<s> 12 12 2006 predates vista s release </s>
<s> i see we ve found the most likely cause </s>
<s> in closing uac can block drivers </s>
<s> i know to shut that down during driver installs </s>
<s> also i didn t see vista mentioned till this last post </s>
<s> since you are making incomplete posts it s unlikely that anyone can guess what the issue is but given that date i d say you found it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have uac completely disabled because it s annoying and when i try to install the update it gives the error message i copied into my last response </s>
<s> any insight on why that would happen </s>
<s> since i downloaded the 945gm express chipset update and that s the chipset i have i don t know why it s giving me that error message </s>
<s> but i agree that s probably it </s>
<s> thanks for the help again </s>
<s> that your bios is current and you have the i945gm video </s>
<s> i have not checked your work here </s>
<s> there s a reason i haven t and it s because the details are being slowed given out </s>
<s> when you post everytime you post there is a note asking you to give out details </s>
<s> without such i am left to wait for the details or just give general responses </s>
<s> you found the most likely cause of the issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> quot video controller intel graphics media accelerator 950 up to 224 mb of shared video memory when 512 mb or more system memory present quot now let s find the i950 drivers </s>
<s> is a start and the i945gm is not listed </s>
<s> is interesting as they show no vista drivers </s>
<s> are you sure this laptop is supposed to be running vista </s>
<s> let s take this one step at a time </s>
<s> try the 4 drivers listed at for vista bob </s>
<s> i took a screen shot of the device manager i bought this laptop from the gateway site last summer august 2007 it came with vista </s>
<s> it had a harddrive problem so they sent me another with factory defaults this past winter 1 2008 so it s even more strange the driver is from 2006 i googled my installation error quot the driver being installed is not validated for this computer quot and it seems like other people with gateway laptops have this error </s>
<s> in my previous post i meant it seemed like a lot of people who were trying to download intel driver updates had the same error i m getting </s>
<s> i see no less than four possible drivers </s>
<s> using the i945gm should have failed </s>
<s> again you have a warranty issue </s>
<s> it s been defective since day one it seems </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> oh lol </s>
<s> found the solution on some european world of warcraft forum </s>
<s> apparently there s some glitch with the exe file intel s update uses that makes vista unhappy </s>
<s> so i had to download the zip file for the 945gm driver and then tell the driver to update from a disk but actually find the place where i extracted the zip file to and say that s where it should update from </s>
<s> specifically a inf file in the extracted updater </s>
<s> tricky </s>
<s> so yeah nothing wrong with driver or hardware or anything </s>
<s> just vista intel stupid </s>
<s> the forum was if anyone wants to read up on it more </s>
<s> so yay happy ending </s>
<s> my video driver is now up to date </s>
<s> thanks for your effort and patience rob </s>
<s> there are some million machines out there </s>
<s> i know the issue the usual cure and have never had to go to that extreme yet </s>
<s> thanks for keeping at it and sharing what you found </s>
<s> i value such feedback since quot now i know quot and will do better next time around thanks to you </s>
