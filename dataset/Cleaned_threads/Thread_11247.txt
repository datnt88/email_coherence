<s> a while ago my 350w psu failed so i replaced it with an antec truepower trio 550w </s>
<s> i connected it to my asus m3a motherboard and when i turned it on sparks came out of that motherboard </s>
<s> the motherboard is wasted and i was told that something with cpu voltages went wrong i don t really understand but anyhow i need to get a new motherboard </s>
<s> i want it to either be compatible with the 550w psu and my athlon 64 x2 dual core 6400 because somehow that s where it went wrong </s>
<s> or if you say it s silly to buy a new motherboard and not a new cpu which ones should i buy that are compatible with eachother my psu my memory i really don t have a clue what type or ram it is i could check if you want </s>
<s> i really need some help with this i want to avoid another quot fireworks party quot and need my pc up and running again soon </s>
<s> replaced several psu with different wattage before and the most important is the main board power pins </s>
<s> second will be the drives </s>
<s> sparks that you gotten would probably be and unwanted plugging in of a line to the plug which is actually not meant for power but rather a peripheral </s>
<s> any new board will have a manual to guide you on which plug really needs to be plugged especially ensuring the main 16 20 pin is completely plugged </s>
<s> everything was connected correctly i found some article where the same motherboard was burned in the same spot as with mine anyhow that s no use now even though it s unclear why it s broken it is and i d like to replace it </s>
<s> i can t buy the same motherboard as i had because that would probably give the same weird problem and fireworks </s>
