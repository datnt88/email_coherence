<s> is it worth getting an ipad 3 or waiting until windows tablets come out </s>

<s> if you want a tablet that gives you greater flexibility go for the windows tablet but note that it may be unable to give you the same performance as an ipad </s>

<s> personally i prefer the ipad </s>
<s> do you prefer the ipad because it s less likely to lag and easier or other reasons </s>
<s> i don t own a tablet and am considering one and am trying to decide what would work best for me </s>
<s> who would want a windows tablet now </s>
<s> well ok if you want to shell out 1500 for a slate </s>
<s> but for ipad level hardware price point ms has spent a decade proving it can t do a good job in that arena </s>
<s> maybe when win 8 has been out for a while but not now </s>

<s> an ipad 1 can be updated to the latest ios 5 1 1 and like ios 6 </s>
<s> of course ipad has limits so consider that when you look at when you decide </s>
<s> bottom line wait a few months on how successful the windows tab is before you decide to spend your money </s>
<s> for the price the hardware tends to be underpowered </s>
<s> yeah yeah the people that buy the unuderpowered equipment all say specs don t matter but i see the car commercials which talk about acceleration mpg cyuclinders etc </s>

<s> though ipad3 far better than the windows 8 tablet to suit your budget i would suggest you to go for the windows 8 tablet </s>

<s> i think it depends on you taste if you want a high performance mean flexible lag free machine then choose i pad 3 but the problem or sometimes the advantage of i os is that apple had kept in a prison or a closed box so that nothing can affect you from outside you are safe and secure whatever happens and i tunes and the well flourished application eco system makes i pad 3 an irresistible choice but if u want a tablet with which u can do anything go 4 window 8 tab because you have the full freedom over the device but may not delver the performance by apple s i pad 3 but don t think that windows is low on performance it will be equipped with high end hardware the choice is yours both have their own merits and de merits choose the one which suits you the best i ______________________________________________________________________________________________ </s>
