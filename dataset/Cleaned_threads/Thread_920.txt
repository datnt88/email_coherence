<s> i have a us robotics broadband router model 8003 networking two computers at home for cable broadband </s>
<s> last night i was on the net viewed some movie trailers and closed the browser </s>
<s> i tried getting back on a few mitues later and there was no connection to the net found on both computers </s>
<s> i tries re booting the router by pushing the pin sized reset button after that the status light is still showed as orange which means that there is a system failure according to the us robotics manual </s>
<s> anyone have any possible solutions to find out what excatly is wrong </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> if removal of power and that reset fails it s likely to be dead </s>
<s> reading is interesting in that it could have a security issue </s>
<s> bring that up when you call in for rma </s>
<s> tip be nice but firm on the phone </s>
<s> no threats growls or such </s>
<s> if in warranty good </s>
<s> if not use that security issue to make your point it should be exchanged </s>
<s> tip 2 accept a replacement of another model if it does the same job </s>
<s> observation </s>
<s> officemax had a belkin router for 10 to 15 bucks </s>
<s> i have no use for another one but the problem is that shipping can run as much as replacement </s>
<s> this makes a mess out of repair options bob </s>
<s> thank you very much </s>
<s> if there is some sort of security issue i probably should will just get another one </s>
<s> a cable modem blip by attaching the cm directly to a computer </s>
<s> if you get an ip and get online then reattach the router and get no ip it s likely a failed router </s>
