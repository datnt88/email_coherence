<s> processor fan and processor on my pc burnt up </s>
<s> i want to extract data from it to a rental i have until i decide what i will buy </s>
<s> i cant open the rental to add the hard drives </s>
<s> i can open my original </s>
<s> i have a 120g wd and a 40g wd </s>
<s> is it possible to connect the two pcs and transfer the data </s>
<s> my burnt one starts and runs xp for about 1 2 min then freezes </s>
<s> the rental is xp and has all windows updates </s>
<s> if i boot mine with madboot disk i can locate the files and it will stay operating </s>
<s> when i load windows and boot normally it freezes </s>
<s> you can smell it and the fan doesn t turn </s>
<s> is there a jumper cable i can buy that will let me access my harddrives without booting windows in the source </s>
<s> if i extract the harddrives is there a jumper that will connect them to the rental </s>
<s> the power source on the original still works </s>
<s> i have a westerndigital data lifeguard tools disk </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> no i don t want to fix my dinosaur </s>
<s> when the system boots up </s>
<s> maybe you should do some troubleshooting </s>
<s> maybe simply cpu overheating due to clogged fan heat sink or loss of other fans </s>
<s> there are so many causes of freezing and the least likely is a bad cpu </s>
<s> imho you are simply ignoring what seems to be the real indications of what is wrong with your pc </s>
<s> your cpu must pass the post power on self test which among many other things proves that the cpu if functional </s>
<s> if it fails later it is either temperature or non cpu issues </s>
<s> you may have two options </s>
<s> if you can borrow another pc which will allow you to connect your drives and network it to the rental this might work </s>
<s> another idea assuming the rental has usb available might be to get an external drive case and try that with the rental </s>
<s> this might or might not work </s>
<s> i have had decent luck putting drives in these cases with data already on them and having them recognized just fine </s>
<s> some folks haven t been so lucky however </s>
<s> it might be worth a try </s>
<s> you can get these cases in the 30 to 50 dollar range and you can always keep it for later use </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> get a fan for your cpu before you do burn it up </s>
<s> it won t cost much </s>
