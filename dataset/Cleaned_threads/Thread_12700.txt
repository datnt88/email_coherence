<s> hi i recently bought a headset with a microphone </s>
<s> unfortunately it s not usb and had two connections at the end a light pink one and a light green </s>
<s> i ve plugged them both into the back of the pc the sound works fine but the microphone doesn t work </s>
<s> sound recorder states that another program is recording and that i should switch it off </s>
<s> and the test for the microphone records nothing </s>
<s> i am using windows xp pro </s>
<s> whats wrong </s>
<s> my second problem is i connected my broadband connection to my older pc </s>
<s> it works fine but when i try to share printers </s>
<s> mine isn t in the list </s>
<s> i clicked control panel printers add printer network a canon bjc 2100 my printer is connected to a windows xp machine and my older pc is windows me </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> you have to install the printer on all machines that will use it </s>
<s> even though it s shared the machine printing has to know what it is </s>
<s> then the print job is sent across the network to the printer </s>
<s> right ok thanks i think it s fixed now does anyone have a solution to my evil headset problem </s>
<s> oh nevermind it turned out my sound cards properties muted the microphone </s>
<s> thanks for your help anyway </s>
