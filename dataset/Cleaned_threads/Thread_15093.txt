<s> friend just bought new acer netbook and was told that signal distance is 8 to 10 meters </s>
<s> he can t get a signal from 20 feet </s>
<s> 1st floor r there any netbooks that have a better antenna or i can see no reason to buy one if u have to search for a closer hotspot any advice </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> type vista broadcast flag on any search engine to see why it matters </s>
<s> also test that netbook somewhere else </s>
<s> just so you know i picked up the usual acer aspire one and it s fine </s>
<s> mine runs xp and all i had to to was turn the wifi on </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> involved includes the placement of the wireless router </s>
<s> 1 if it s placed very near a wall signal even to a room just behind that wall will be severally affected as my brother had complained often 2 the number of walls between the router and the room </s>
<s> the more walls between the faster it drops signal more so if the wall has steel bars for structure 3 height of placement is also important </s>
<s> placing too low on the floor also can affect likewise placing too high up </s>
<s> 4 power saving set on your wireless adapter and router </s>
<s> that is 80 meters </s>
<s> ts a msiu100 </s>
<s> apologies if this seems obvious but first step in trouble shooting is to make sure it s turned on </s>
<s> in my experience troubleshooting often stops at this first step </s>
