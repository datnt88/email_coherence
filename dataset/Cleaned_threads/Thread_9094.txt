<s> i m having an issue with my network adapter </s>
<s> my daughter was surfing the web when she says the internet stopped </s>
<s> i looked and the network adapter is not picking up the network from a router two feet away </s>
<s> the wireless network is working fine i can connect with the other three devices in the house </s>
<s> but this cpu will not recognize the network </s>
<s> i have updated the device drivers for the adapter and run a basic windows diagnosis it says the drivers are up to date and the device is operating properly </s>
<s> i have also run anti virus software just in case she picked up something while browsing </s>
<s> what am i missing </s>
<s> but i can t connect to the internet it s weird </s>
<s> what is the problem </s>
<s> if anyone knows help me plz </s>
<s> you said the wireless network is fine so shall we presume this one is wired </s>
<s> if so how far from the device is from the router doesn t much matter </s>
<s> if wired have you tried to ping the gateway </s>
<s> if not you could try that but first check to see if you have a proper ip address </s>
<s> if using windows you type quot ipconfig quot without quotes from the command prompt </s>
<s> it should show several sets of numbers </s>
<s> one will be the gateway address and another will be the ip address of the network adapter s </s>
<s> if ping returns and error the easiest thing to do would be the try a new cable </s>
<s> see what more information you can provide and post back </s>
<s> what exactly does the computer show or say </s>
<s> my guess is that there is some basic physical connection to a wireless router but that it shows as quot limited or no connectivity quot </s>
<s> limited connectivity means that it s not the full connectivity needed to go through the router to the public internet </s>
<s> usually this means that the pc didn t get it s ip address from the router for some reason </s>
<s> and that reason usually is some error in the configuration of either the pc or the router </s>
<s> that s not weird because it s a rather comples area as soon as something is wrong </s>
<s> but there might be other causes </s>
<s> for example the isp might have shut down the connection because you didn t pay </s>
<s> or the cable outside your house is damaged </s>
<s> i ve seen many people without internet for a month or more while the isp tried to fix what was broken with them especially if they had accepted an offer like quot make your internet faster </s>
<s> add interactive tv </s>
<s> add voip </s>
<s> save money </s>
<s> excellent service </s>
<s> highly capable techs </s>
<s> sign here and enjoy next week quot </s>
<s> please tell more about your connection wired wireless </s>
<s> did it ever work </s>
<s> if wireless does it work wired </s>
<s> does it work elsewhere if wireless and a laptop </s>
<s> does another pc or laptop work with you </s>
<s> finally run ipconfig all from the command prompt and post the full output in your answer </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> no this adapter is a wireless adapter card installed on a desktop cpu </s>
<s> i am currently trying to bridge a connection from the laptop via usb to see if maybe the card is damaged </s>
<s> we know norton can do this when it expires </s>
<s> there are some models of laptops that do this too often </s>
<s> and some laptops have a wifi on off feature button </s>
<s> tell more </s>
