<s> hi all i have this issue with my pc where it is connected to the internet </s>
<s> i can ping ip addresses and that works in my browser </s>
<s> however the real issue is when i type the name of a website e g </s>
<s> that is where the browsers pural fail </s>
<s> i have tried all of them to no avail which makes me think this could be registry or the tcp ip settings are messed up </s>
<s> either way i have no idea what to do about this and help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> just to clarify the browser will show the website when i enter the ip address it is when i type the actual name that it doesn t work </s>
<s> did you test your dns </s>
<s> hint use nslookup </s>
<s> sorry but i don t write how to use nslookup </s>
<s> just use a search engine if you don t know how </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> we suspected that it could be dns bob we will run the test made by microsoft from google </s>
<s> could it be anything else </s>
<s> sorry no </s>
<s> it s the first test i d do </s>
<s> tried the test said everything is fine however the issue still remains this should stretch you bob and anyone else </s>
<s> such as the dns your isp has given you </s>
<s> it s not that i don t know the issue but given such limited details i can only share what i use for a test </s>
<s> 1 third party software managing your connection 2 anything to do with wireless security if you re not wired 3 your firewall 4 your router s firewall settings 5 your isp 6 using vpn do you have access to another pc you can try so you can rule that out </s>
<s> the dns is the one that the isp has given us never said that you don t know the issue fact is your very very good solved many issues for me </s>
<s> windows is managing my connection with me testing on so many browsers i made sure that the firewall didn t get in the way remember that when i type the ip address in the address bar it works so why not work when words are used my router firewall isn t the issue i think because the computer gets through to the internet we don t use vpn unfortunatly i only have a desktop thanks for the suggestions </s>
<s> it s possible the cause could be in that or you have a proxy set a dns resolver or such as a browser addon but the issue is classic dns </s>
<s> the name to numeric translation is broken </s>
<s> just need to think of where these break and often we find it with highjackthis or nslookup or your common settings </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will try run the program and see if that works i will also try booting up ie with no add ons i may not reply until tomorrow as it is fairly late in the uk and i have work tomorrow so please check back on the forum thank you for your help and suggestions bob it is very much apprecited </s>
<s> your system can t resolve the names you type in </s>
<s> somehow its not connecting to the dns server to resolve </s>
<s> here s the place to start to diagnose the problem here what i would do 1 if you have another computer connect to the same router and get on the internet </s>
<s> if that works that means the dns server on your isp side is not the problem </s>
<s> the config on the computer experiencing the dns error is the problem </s>
<s> 1a </s>
<s> find out the ip of the dns server by going into your router s utility page usually 192 168 0 1 go to the status device info and wan or something similar to this </s>
<s> you should see dns and a couple of ipaddresses </s>
<s> take one of these no </s>
<s> and go to the cmd window and ping it </s>
<s> if you can t ping it then something in your computer is preventing it </s>
<s> 1b </s>
<s> go to your cmd window </s>
<s> type ipconfig all </s>
<s> if these setting were automatic you should see an ipaddress for the router like 192 168 0 1 so when you type a name and your computer doesn t know the ipaddress the request goes to the router and the router sends it to the dns server and it comes back to your computer with the right ipaddress </s>
<s> if the settings on these are wrong then your going to have a problem </s>
<s> 1c </s>
<s> if your computer thinks it knows the ipaddress to a name such as google but it s corrupt then the problem is probably with the hostfile or dns cache </s>
<s> 2 if it shows the same error as the other computer that may mean that there s a dns server problem </s>
<s> either your not connecting to it or possible the dns server is down </s>
<s> i would call your isp to see if they are having dns server issues </s>
<s> hmmm philbernie i thank you for the tips and as soon as i get back from work tonight i will give what you said a go and then inform you if it worked or not </s>
