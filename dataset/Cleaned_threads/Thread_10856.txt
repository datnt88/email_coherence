<s> hi all my xps410 winxp 4gb ram began having startup problems this morning </s>
<s> upon power up it gets to the windows xp startup screen the blue dots scroll back and forth for about 20 30 seconds then the monitor goes blank </s>
<s> i can start the computer in safe mode ok i used system restore to go backwards a couple of days but no luck with that either </s>
<s> what am i missing here </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> while in safe mode set the video mode to 800 by 600 ok your way out and then click start shutdown restart </s>
<s> i did try that with no luck thanks for the suggestion </s>
<s> i have noticed that when the windows startup screen goes blank i then hear the hard drive spin down </s>
<s> i have disabled all the services and startup entries in msconfig that made no difference </s>
<s> i have removed ram sticks one pair at a time as well as individually also with no change </s>
<s> that tidbit would have changed my advice </s>
<s> in this case i would head back to safe mode and research all items in msconfig and see what i could disable </s>
<s> remember i would not leave any any entry enabled unless i knew why </s>
<s> bob </s>
