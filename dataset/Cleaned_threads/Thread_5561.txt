<s> i am basically clueless as to the rest of the components like motherboard ram although i want 4 gb case etc </s>
<s> i ve actually decided to change the processor to the e6750 </s>
<s> good idea or bad idea </s>
<s> and is it better than the q6600 </s>
<s> the e6750 is 190 instead of the 250 for the q6600 on newegg </s>
<s> i still need help with the rest of the components </s>

<s> i ve been doing a little research on cases </s>
<s> is this a good case </s>
<s> and if so what is a good power supply to buy with it </s>
<s> if anyone isnt too busy i still need help with the rest of my build </s>
<s> thanks </s>
