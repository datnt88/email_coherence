<s> do i need to purchase a external device such as graphic card or video card or something to make it work </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> all computers need a graphic card to work </s>
<s> your laptop of course has one </s>
<s> now you say your s video cable doesn t work </s>
<s> here is the thing </s>
<s> s video is not good for computer to tv </s>
<s> tell me what is the make model of your tv </s>
<s> better yet what inputs holes does it have on the back </s>
<s> does it have a blue monitor plug </s>
<s> or dvi </s>
<s> hdmi </s>
<s> component </s>
<s> a work around this may or may not work </s>
<s> right click your desktop click properties </s>
<s> click the settings tab </s>
<s> look at the slide bar on the right hand side </s>
<s> drag it all the way to the left </s>
<s> then plug the cable in again </s>
<s> s video is primarily used for tv to dvd player or tv to vcr </s>
<s> s video cannot display the amount of pixels that your monitor has </s>
<s> your laptop is doing good you just may need a cable or two to connect it to your tv </s>
<s> hth ibrahim </s>
<s> i have a toshiba satellite also </s>
<s> any type of copy protected content such as a commercial dvd will only display on your laptop s screen </s>
<s> if it displayed it on your tv then it could be recorded </s>
<s> i know it s a pain in the butt </s>
<s> when i travel i d much rather carry a few dvds and watch them on the hotel s tv rather than pay 6 for a movie </s>
<s> there are some hacks for windvd that will turn off this feature </s>
<s> you could also rip the dvd to disk and remove the copy protection </s>
<s> but i don t think we discuss stuff like that in this forum </s>
<s> google </s>
<s> i always thought if you d mirror it as a copy in the settings it d have to be a copy of it </s>
<s> thanks for the info </s>
<s> ibrahim </s>
