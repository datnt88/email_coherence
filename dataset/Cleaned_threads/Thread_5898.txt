<s> my husband and i recently purchased an hp j3680 all in one </s>
<s> shortly thereafter we both purchased laptops </s>
<s> obviously if we would have known we were buying laptops we would have purchased a printer with a wireless card </s>
<s> a rep on the live chat with hp tells me that the j3680 is not bluetooth compatible but i m not sure i trust him her they seemed to have a poor grasp on what i was asking </s>
<s> my question is two fold a is the j3680 bluetooth enabled </s>
<s> and if not b is there an wireless printer adapter out there that we can get to be able to print to the j3680 without physically connecting the usb cord to our laptops </s>
<s> as to printer servers those are from linksys netgear and such </s>
<s> however i find these too hard to setup for most owners </s>
<s> even i was taken aback following a 15 plus foldout sheet of instructions </s>
<s> while you could research wifi print servers you seem to want more support than i m seeing in the field </s>
<s> i d contact a geeksquad and ask quot how much to get it working quot bob </s>
<s> i ve seen the printer servers and they appear to be more expensive than it would be to just buy a new printer with wireless capabilities especially if we watched sales and picked one up cheap </s>
<s> it s still debatable about how terrible these things are to setup but here s one i one gt from however this is still too rough on setup in my opinion but the price was right and i have some usb memory stick served up too </s>
<s> i put a watt meter on it and it sits there drawing 2 watts so it s not as bad as some others </s>
