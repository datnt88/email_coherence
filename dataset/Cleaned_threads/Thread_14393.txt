<s> i have a gateway ma7 mx5669 running windows 7 that will power up but the only activity that can be seen is the cd rom and the hard drive startup for a few seconds </s>
<s> i tried a trick that i read about where you press the on key down for 60 seconds with the battery removed and then plug it in </s>
<s> it is supposed to bleed off some residual charge in the pc but it did not work for me i removed reinserted and then removed the two 1gb memory sticks </s>
<s> no beeps nothing different than before </s>
<s> i have hooked the laptop up to an external monitor nothing </s>
<s> all the usual power lights are on and the fan is running as normal </s>
<s> it is as if the normal bootup got truncated after about 5 seconds </s>
<s> i am thinking it is the motherboard because of not hearing any beeps when i removed the memory but i am also wondering if it is possible it could be something else like the video card </s>
<s> i would be very happy for it to be the video board </s>
<s> what i am wondering is if anyone can tell me where i might go from here to determine what the issue is </s>
<s> thanks very much jim lee </s>
<s> try the generic reset power off remove battery ac press hold power button for 60 seconds release and test </s>
<s> yes i read you tried it but you didn t tell if the ac was removed </s>

<s> but i read you think there is a video card </s>
