<s> my mouse pointer recently started to move and click on its own </s>
<s> it would draw selection rectangles and right click and left click </s>
<s> i disconnected the network but it continued </s>
<s> avg and panda were unable to detect viruses and windows defender and ad aware failed to find spyware </s>
<s> i swapped mice and noticed when i installed my backup mouse with the original drivers that there was a second mouse installed on my system in device manager </s>
<s> it was a generic driver for a quot hid compliant mouse quot </s>
<s> when i disabled this device the mouse stopped moving on its own </s>
<s> i tried uninstalling it but it came back </s>
<s> i don t know if it will stay disabled </s>
<s> has anyone ever heard of this happening before </s>
<s> i d boot safe mode and remove all mice found </s>
<s> let windows use what it feels like on the next boot </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you get into the habit of rolling a wheel on the mousepad </s>
<s> its almost like a third hand </s>
<s> but if you have an optical mouse there isn t any ball to drag on a mouse pad </s>
<s> just a laser light </s>
<s> so if you pick up your optical mouse off the optical surface it will move on its own </s>
<s> almost feeling like someone else is using it </s>
<s> could that be it </s>
