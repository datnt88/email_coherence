<s> i need to buy a lot of ink cartridges so i m trying to find a place online to buy these for the least cost </s>
<s> i wasn t sure if anyone had any favorites </s>
<s> so far i have checked with staples office depot office max circuit city best buy cd amazon antonline beach audio ace photo digital j r the nerds net b h video direct inkjet superstore ebay wal mart kmart also if you have any negative experiences with these sites i appreciate that info as well </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> ok lets see b h is going to be expensive staples and offices will sometimes have sales or coupons </s>
<s> i havent found anything on ebay that made sense yet </s>
<s> the internet </s>
<s> i have tried 2 different places and had nothing but problems </s>
<s> i have an hp 6210 all in one 1 black and 1 color cart </s>
<s> soooo i get mine at wal mart until i find something better which i hope may come up in answers here ted </s>
<s> i have had good luck with my cartridges at carrotink com johnny </s>
<s> hi there i have been using phoenix inks for a while now they give a great fast service and reasonable prices too plus a buyback service on some empty cart s give them a look at good luck steve </s>
<s> if you have a local walgreens drup store around they should refill your empty cartridges a lot cheaper than buying more new ones </s>
<s> once you have an empty one just drop it off at walgreens and they will refill it </s>
<s> i have had good luck on ebay with the abacusfree store </s>
<s> they also have a site </s>
<s> same people ebay site has free shipping the other does not </s>
<s> been using their aftermarket cartridges at work for almost 2 years without a problem </s>
<s> i buy mine from they have a wide assortment of the brands </s>
<s> they are usually half price if not better </s>
<s> free shipping if you join there club </s>
<s> the club is free just they setup a regular delivery schedule of ink for you </s>
<s> which you can adjust as you see fit </s>
<s> i ve been buying mine there for a couple of years now </s>
<s> there inks are good enough for everyday printing and decent photo output </s>
<s> if you require top notch finish stick with the retail ink from the manufactor </s>
<s> they are usually the highest quality </s>
<s> but not cheap </s>
<s> this goes for all the generic ink outfits </s>
<s> for me i haven t needed the highest quality </s>
<s> also i have found by using the cheaper inks i can go for better paper and get pretty damn good quality there </s>
<s> just my 2 cents </s>
<s> i have been buying compatible ink cartridges from clickinks com because there price is a few cents lower that others and they also have a buy 2 and get 1 free offer on all orders </s>
<s> so for the price of 2 i get 3 and save some money </s>
<s> and they are quick on deliverys </s>
<s> they also sell oem ink </s>
<s> check them out </s>
<s> for years i ve been buying my ink on line via and have had nothing but good luck with their products </s>
<s> it s all been non oem stuff but it s also cost a fraction of what it would have cost me through the big name retail channels </s>
<s> honestly in the hundreds of cartridges i ve used over the years i can count on one hand the number of bad one s </s>
<s> if a cartridge is bad it s not so painful to just toss it because they are so cheap to begin with </s>
<s> i d suggest buying a few just to quot try them out quot and see how they work with your printers </s>
<s> i certainly can t complain as they ve worked great for me </s>
<s> i have been getting mine from printpal com for the last few years </s>
<s> service has been great and fast </s>
<s> never had to return any so i cannot comment about that </s>
<s> for a 10 discount and free shipping use 10 before i found these guys i bought from mrink com </s>
<s> i had a couple of leaky carts and a wierd message on the monitor due to incompatibility problems </s>
<s> mrink made good with minimum hassel </s>
<s> urgent needs i usually get at walmart </s>
<s> thinking of trying the refill trick at walgreens next time o have an empty </s>
<s> iheard bad news about some of the e bay vendors so i didn t even try them </s>
<s> ymmv and good luck </s>
<s> sometimes you meet great people dealing online </s>
<s> i m a photographer and a graphics guy who uses a lot of ink </s>
<s> ran into a start up guy named brandon who owns inkgrabber </s>
<s> great attitude </s>
<s> he saved me a fortune looking for local specials and my epsom photo printer functions really well on the non original equipment ink they have </s>
<s> if you try them out please say hi from bob from upstate new york </s>
<s> i have been buying from for 3 or 4 years </s>
<s> i have never had a bad one </s>
<s> they are very cheap but usually are the same off brand cartridges sold by others for 2 3 time as much </s>
<s> my canon pixma1500 carts are 99 for b w and 1 49 for color </s>
<s> has anyone here tried walgreens cartridge refill service </s>
<s> if so how is the quality of the ink and of the job itself </s>
<s> myinks com </s>
<s> i have bought my ink from two places the first is 123inkjets com </s>
<s> their prices are very good for the printer that i have about 4 00 per cartridge </s>
<s> the last place that i purchased ink from was abcink com and their prices were just as good as 123inkjets com </s>
<s> the only reason that i changed companies was 123inkjets com no longer uses paypal as a payment source </s>
<s> i received fast service from both of those companies </s>
<s> for europeans meeding to avoid postage costs from usa sources the british does quite a good deal on compatible cartridges </s>
<s> any other good eurodeals </s>
<s> sorry it took so long to answer </s>
<s> the replies were not showing up on my profile so i didn t realize all these had come in </s>
<s> i appreciate all the help </s>
<s> i went ahead and bought from staples i ended up saving about 10 over what i could find from the cheapest store for the cartridge </s>
<s> since i needed them quickly and needed good quality i decided not to take any chances plus i could return them right to the store if there was a problem </s>
<s> i appreciate all the help and definitely will be checking these sites for the future </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> i just tried office max brand of canon ink for my all in one and the black started to either dry too soon or clog the print head </s>
<s> returned it and replaced with canon brand to fix it </s>
<s> now about to try premium imaging products made in china damn it </s>
<s> from hope it will be better </s>
<s> i don t think any off brand will ever be as good as the original for any printer </s>
<s> always compare the printer cartridge prices before youre buying it will save you a lot of dollars which is certainly important in these hard times </s>
<s> and lets you compare prices on the products so you now that you get the cheapest available price </s>
