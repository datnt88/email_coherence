<s> hi i am going to build a new computer for gaming </s>
<s> i e </s>
<s> crysis bioshock etc </s>
<s> i am wondering what would perform better </s>
<s> intel core 2 duo e6750 asus p5n32 e sli plus 775 pci e nvidia 650i or amd x2 dual core am2 athlon 64 4600 asus m2n sli deluxe skt am2 if its too hard to tell w o tests dw </s>
<s> over at for most the intel core 2 duo will be the winner for today </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i saw a bit of tomshardware on youtube but all of the stuff was like 5 years old p4 </s>
<s> he has the core 2 duo and x2 amd results too </s>
<s> since the c2d wins today i ll stop here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> intel is an industry leader </s>
<s> amd is nothing but cheaper copied intel knockoffs adn i say that with complete honestly and certainty </s>
<s> intel s performance benchamrks say everything you need to hear </s>
<s> as for a specific processor given the selection i would choose the core2duo however if you really want the best processor available i would go with the new core 2 extreme </s>
<s> this processor is unique in that it has 4 core different the the current standard of 2 which function as mini engine processor </s>
<s> infact crysis has be optimized for use on the core2extreme c2e chip which means that crysis was designed coded to work better on the specific chip </s>
<s> crysis is going to be a sick agme nowhere else has there been such a high multi threaded game with advance enemy ai </s>
<s> yes the enemy becomes smarter base on your playing and processor ability </s>
<s> good luck an happy building fyi the processor is the heart mind lungs and nerves of the computer so try to invest in the best on you can buy </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i will try to afford a c2e but its like 500 im english </s>
<s> and thats quite alot of money </s>
<s> for me anyway considering im only 13 </s>
<s> but thanks again </s>
<s> i have a nice core duo 2 0 ghz laptop </s>
<s> it s fine </s>
<s> no 3d games since it has only the 950 gma solution but for a desktop you can go with dual core pentiums and get quite the bang for the buck </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> monopoly </s>
<s> we d have less cpu development and much higher prices </s>
<s> it wasn t long ago that amd was in the driver s seat </s>
<s> in this case it s clear competition benefits consumers and end users </s>
<s> keeps the mfgs on their toes </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> this is true however let us not forget other competitiors like ibm and via technologies that also make processors and have been way before amd s time </s>
<s> yes a competitve marketplace breeds innovation at lower prices yet it also derails research developement through creating a resource shift to marketing which is typically becomes half of cost of the product </s>
<s> in addition intel didn t need competition to drive its innovation as it was already dedicated to exponential improvements through its commitment to moore s law </s>
<s> a mere 25 percent marketshare consisting of niche segments ie </s>
<s> gamers is hardly a driverseat as much as a stowaway </s>
