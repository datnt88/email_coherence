<s> hello my laser for my dvd drive has burned out it is unable to read dvds </s>
<s> anyways i recently looked online for possible solutions and found out i can transfer a dvd drive from one of my old computers into the burned out one </s>
<s> so i thought of my toshiba laptop </s>
<s> then i started to think if it wouldnt work since laptops are compressed hardware and you cant upgrade them etc </s>
<s> so my question is is it possible to extract my dvd drive from my toshiba laptop and place in my desktop computer windows xp professional edition if so please explain the steps </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> you would use a laptop to desktop adapter </s>
<s> however this will cost about the same price as a dvdrw drive so must you do this </s>

<s> thanks for the reply i don t see a point in purchasing a whole new adapter when i can just go to the shop nearby </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> to avoid buying them new </s>
<s> that s why i suggest you pick up a 30 buck dvdrw from geeks com or newegg com since the adapter should run about that or more </s>
