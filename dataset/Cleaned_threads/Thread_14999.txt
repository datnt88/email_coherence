<s> hi all i am a student who has just started year 11 and i am taking graphic design </s>
<s> i really enjoy the class and i am looking to see if i could should would buy a graphics tablet </s>
<s> i want to buy one but i am wondering if they are really worth it </s>
<s> i have a pretty low ish budget i don t really want to go over the 250 mark if i dont absolutely have to and i have been looking at wacom bamboo s the ones with touch capability preferably medium sized 27cmx14cm active area programmable buttons priced from 120 for a small bamboo create all the way up to 240 for a medium bamboo create wacom intuos5 s 240 for a small 350 for a medium first off my parents dont really want me spending as much as 350 for something that i am not positive i will continually use i myself dont know if i will get used to it enjoy using it </s>
<s> i dont have much money that i have available to spend as i am saving for a car </s>
<s> i plan on using it sometimes not every day for graphic design class and just having fun drawing my own creations </s>
<s> i do have graphic design class 4 out of 5 days of college but i may only bring it if i bring my laptop i cant install the drivers on school computers </s>
<s> if i can bring my computer to college then i will be using the tablet 4 out of 5 days maybe more over the weekend for homework leisure </s>
<s> so here s my question s finally is it worth spending the extra money for a medium sized tablet </s>
<s> should i try with a bamboo small or medium </s>
<s> first and see if i like it and i do like it go for an intuos </s>
<s> or should i go straight for an intuos5 </s>
<s> if i do would the small be big enough for me </s>
<s> would i need to invest in a medium for it to be worth it </s>
<s> is it worth getting a graphics tablet at all </s>
<s> please please please be honest i dont want to waste my hard earned money </s>
<s> thanks so much for your opinions hellz_angel </s>
<s> for the wacom intuos5 s i want touch capability too </s>
<s> its in my essentials list </s>
<s> the artists i ve worked with were more concerned about pressure sense levels and accuracy than touch </s>
<s> it s your money buy what you want </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob i realise the quot importance quot of pressure sentivity but i want to have the touch capability </s>
<s> between a medium and a small what would you recommend </s>
<s> should i get an intuos5 </s>
<s> the artists i have run into want and get the cintiq but in that class device it depends on what you want </s>
<s> what i think rarely matters but touch is there because of that current technology which i won t mention </s>
<s> for example if you want to draw a longer line you d want the bigger painting pad </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob i didnt really understand what youre trying to say in your first point and for the thought that for bigger lines a bigger tablet is needed that is not true </s>
<s> wacom tablets most graphics tablets for that matter run in absolute mode meaning the active area of the tablet represents the whole screen </s>
<s> this means that i can draw the same size line whether or not i have a small medium or large tablet </s>
<s> i can t afford the cintiq with the massive price tag just yet and i don t know if i will enjoy using the tablet anyways so im not spending over 1 000 for a tablet that i might use for 2 months and then leave it alone </s>
<s> sorry to be difficult hellz </s>
<s> you find the larger tablet can give you more control over where the line ends </s>
<s> however i find folk struggle over zooming in out and well it takes time to master the tools </s>
<s> my first comment is that the artists i run into don t use the model you noted </s>
<s> they head up to the cintiq </s>
<s> but a pad is just that </s>
<s> i can only guess how long you ve been using one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob that seems fair enough that you say ill have more control with the medium although for the amount i will be using it is it really worth it </s>
<s> i have never used a graphics tablet before this would be my first </s>
<s> so again here is my question will a small be big enough for my needs </s>
<s> thanks so much bob hellz </s>
<s> hey again please note the wacom bamboo create is the equivalent of the medium intuos5 but for around 150 </s>
<s> would this be a better idea for my first tablet </s>
<s> thanks again hellz </s>
<s> i was thinking you were a current user and apologize for that </s>
<s> by all means go cheap </s>
<s> i thought you were using such a thing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hey bob so from that i understand that youre suggesting i go with a bamboo first </s>
<s> or should i still go with a small intuos5 </s>
<s> thanks hellz </s>
<s> i don t want to dissuade about drawing tablets so get your first one and see how you like it </s>
<s> and find someone with the cintiq to see why i wrote about that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi again i know im really horrible with thinking of everything to put in my message anyway here are some points i was considering i intend to carry the tablet to college every day so an intuos5 small would be more portable than a medium bamboo create </s>
<s> the intuos5 small has about the same ratio for corner to corner sweeping as my mouse having a small intuos5 will help me determine if i want to go for a medium or a large later on the bamboo create has much less pressure levels less nibs less buttons but a much lower price than the intuos5 small right now i just need to know if a i should get a medium bamboo create or a small intuos5 </s>
<s> thanks hellz </s>
<s> what type of paint should i use </s>
<s> which brush is best </s>
<s> nod to price and more levels of pressure </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi ben so i gather from your reply that your advice would be to go for an intuos5 small since it has a much higher range of pressure sensitivity </s>
<s> thanks ronan </s>
<s> it s partly why folk go to art school </s>
<s> sure you could pick up a brush and paint but there s nothing like diving in and doing </s>
<s> also with a little helpful advice </s>
<s> since you have never used such before you can t know if this tool is going to be what you like </s>
<s> so price is the best decision maker here </s>
<s> that way you can see if it s the tool you dreamed of and as far as size or other features go it won t matter when you select your next device </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob finally decided on a puchase i got the wacom bamboo create pen and touch </s>
<s> thanks for all your help ronan </s>
