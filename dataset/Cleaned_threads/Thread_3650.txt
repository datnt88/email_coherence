<s> i have an epson rx500 that s just over a year old </s>
<s> meaning just out of warranty </s>
<s> i ve now got a hardware problem that appears to be related to the print head location movement </s>
<s> the error message simply reads quot printer error see your documentation and call service if necessary quot very helpful not </s>
<s> since its out of warranty i m torn between paying to fix it or just trashing it altogether </s>
<s> the local best buy wants 50 just to look at it plus parts and labor on top of that </s>
<s> the repair cost could easily eclipse the cost of a new multifunction unit </s>
<s> i just hate to have to throw out what was a decent relatively new printer </s>
<s> what would you do </s>
<s> it s not worth getting it fixed </s>
<s> the repair will be at least 100 00 50 00 repair estimate with another min </s>
<s> 50 00 in labor and parts </s>
<s> we are a throw away society </s>
<s> costs less to replace than to fix </s>
<s> i hate to say it but i think you d be better off tossing it out and buying new </s>
<s> the same holds true for most monitors as well </s>
<s> when it cost s more to upgrade or fix something than buying new something just seems wrong with the world huh </s>
