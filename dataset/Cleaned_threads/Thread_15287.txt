<s> my friend office have been setup using a wifi for its network </s>
<s> using ssid password and wep as security plus a mac address filter </s>
<s> its works for all the employee 8 of them all using a laptop </s>
<s> hardware are linksys wrt54g windows xp pro sp2 </s>
<s> problem is the guess who bring their own laptop can not connect to the network and internet unless someone type the ssid password and inserting the mac address manually in the router but they don t have an it guy question is how to give a guess an access to network internet without changing the router configuration back and forth i thought of having 2 two access point using different channel but one of the ap is open no security but it will be turn on off as necessary if this configuration is possible can both ap different channel still share a file or printer </s>
<s> any information or idea is appreciated thank you </s>
<s> can they share a file or printer </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> however if you have an ap with no security then you ve opened up your network </s>
<s> handing out your ssid and wep keys to guest is not ideal either from a security stand point </s>
<s> you could put a printer in the quot dmz quot and have the guest come in on the dmz side </s>
<s> just keep in mind that any thing you allow guest to access from the dmz so can the rest of the world that is within rf range </s>
<s> so that makes file sharing a wee bit difficult </s>
<s> to keep the network secure they will have to keep entering the mac wep and ssid </s>
<s> scott </s>
<s> with two different channel i can still share file and printer right </s>
<s> i e </s>
<s> read write and print to a laptop that connected in different channel as for security like i mention in my post the open wifi network is turn off on as needed when a there is a guess as for putting or letting the guess in dmz zone this involving ap router configuration everytime a guess is coming correct </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> try not to use mac filtering in the router </s>
<s> just use ssid and wep security </s>
<s> so you can set up ssid and wep for your guess without reconfig the router </s>
<s> this way still give you some protection but not as good as with mac filter too </s>
<s> it s simple and effective </s>
<s> after we have the lan wifi up then we can see how wep wap such works out </s>
<s> i wish it always worked but some make models don t work with all clients so we start with the mac filtering and move up </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it is not clear in the description </s>
<s> do you have a server network or is it all peer to peer </s>
<s> if a network server is included the ssis wep access without mac filtering will let guests get only to the internet </s>
<s> no adjustments are needed for each new guest </s>
<s> periodic changing of wep key can maintain security </s>
