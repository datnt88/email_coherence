<s> hello all i use dual samsung 245bw syncmaster monitors and i ve recently noticed that one of them displays a slight yellow or off white hue </s>
<s> i use the exact same display settings on both monitors </s>
<s> additionally i tried playing with the settings on the suspect monitor and it doesn t seem to help the problem at all </s>
<s> below are links to two pictures of the problem </s>
<s> these aren t the best photos in the world but hopefully they help </s>
<s> the monitor in question is the one on the right </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> as ccfl the lamp age you see that happen </s>
<s> somewhere around 5 years they tend to move to pink or red </s>
<s> this is why you want to replace these with led back lit displays when they have grown old </s>
<s> i will not write word one about any monitor settings </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> is worthy reading since it shows how ccfl and some displays are less than perfect in the lighting </s>
<s> now we have to ask how much is a perfect display </s>
<s> i think we need to look at barco displays to see how much this could cost </s>
