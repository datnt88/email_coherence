<s> i have a motherboard asus p4pe x that supports pc3200 which gives the machine a faster front side bus fsb </s>
<s> i originally began with a single pc2700 512 ram </s>
<s> i bought two 256 ram sticks of pc3200 and removed the pc2700 </s>
<s> my question now is i have three slots for memory can i run pc3200 w pc2700 </s>
<s> it will operate at the 333mhz rate </s>
<s> this if course given it s the same kind of ram just different speeds </s>
<s> what does the book that came with your asus p4pe x say </s>
<s> you can put different speeds in but they will all run at the slower speed </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> never miss match ram </s>
<s> it defeats the purpose </s>
<s> sell the pc2700 on ebay and buy pc3200 to match what you have </s>
<s> better yet i would look for three sticks of 512 at 3200 that match </s>
<s> more bang for your bucks </s>
