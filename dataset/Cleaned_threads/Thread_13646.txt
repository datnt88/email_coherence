<s> i need to do some crowd sourcing </s>
<s> i currently have a dir 655 that is dying </s>
<s> the problem seems to be the power cord </s>
<s> i thought about trying to replace only the cord but we all know that once something like a router starts getting hit with electrical issues its only a matter of time before it dies altogether </s>
<s> so my question then becomes which router to replace it with </s>
<s> ordinarily i d stick with what s worked for me </s>
<s> unfortunately i don t have that kind of money right now </s>
<s> there is also a timing factor that keeps me from going online for a really good deal </s>
<s> i literally have about 50 to spend and i m in a small town with a wal mart and a radio shack to serve my tech needs </s>
<s> so i m pretty much stuck picking from three routers </s>
<s> netgear wgr614 wireless g 54mbps broadband router netgear wgr614 wireless g 54mbps broadband router cisco linksys wireless n router wrt120n belkin surf n300 wireless router now i have to say the belkin is one i m not really interested in because i ve never ever had a good experience with them </s>
<s> however i m willing to be fair </s>
<s> the only thing that bothers me about the cisco is it claims to be wireless n 2 0 but they aren t willing to say what the top speed of the wireless radio is anywhere on the box </s>
<s> as for the net gear i ve had a hit or miss relationship with them </s>
<s> had a great hub once but also had a horrible router once </s>
<s> the last thing i ll say is obviously i want to get the best overall router for the money and while the wireless is certainly important in that regard right now everything is wired so i just need something to get me by until i can get a better router </s>
<s> in other words something that doesn t need power cycled every other day </s>
<s> so what do you think </s>
<s> you are pretty much limited if you are going to buy from a retail store in a small town and not buy online </s>
<s> i would not buy a g router any more </s>
<s> eventually all your other equipment will get upgraded to n and then you have to upgrade your router again </s>
<s> i suspect n will be the best you can get for many years to come </s>
<s> as far as speed goes in the short run they will exactly what you have today since you will need to run in g mode unless all your pc s have n already </s>
<s> in the future when you upgrade your n speed will be based on which features both the router and the nic cards support </s>
<s> most say they will do 150m and some say 300m </s>
<s> your limiting factor is the internet so it does not really matter a lot </s>
<s> these numbers are all best case numbers anyway </s>
<s> buy the router for the other features firewall url filter etc etc </s>
<s> the radio part are pretty much the same </s>
<s> i would stay wired once it works it works until the hardware fails </s>
<s> let s ditch scratch that one without further ado </s>
<s> the dlr 655 at seems to gain favor in reviews and owners </s>
<s> if you need that </s>
<s> my older wnr2000 and similar 3700 run for months without power cycling </s>
<s> that 614 is well known for it s lockups when folk try to run torrents </s>
<s> but go figure </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well you can pick either or </s>
<s> maybe the prices are a little bit different but it s really up to you </s>
<s> i have the cisco linksys wireless router for a long time now and so far it didn t give me no problem </s>
<s> i really like cisco linksys wireless routers </s>
