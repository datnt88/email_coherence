<s> amateur here and any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> i have a gateway computer about a year and a half old running xp with a lcd flat screen monitor </s>
<s> all was well until today when after the computer had been on quot stand by quot mode the monitor failed to automatically come on when i started the computer up again </s>
<s> i turned off the power button to the monitor then turned it back on again and received the message quot no signal quot </s>
<s> after checking to see if the connections were all secure i restarted the computer not just quot stand by quot and the monitor came on as normal </s>
<s> i tried quot stand by quot again with the same quot no signal quot results </s>
<s> i m at a loss </s>
<s> don t know if this means i need a new graphics card or perhaps to at least check if it is seated correctly </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> the monitor has a low power state activated and deactivated by the video card </s>
<s> either the card is not sending the signal or the monitor is not responding </s>
<s> swap one or the other for a test </s>
<s> thanks much cory </s>
<s> i ll give a shot to swapping the monitor out first </s>
<s> hopefully by process of elimination i ll have a culprit at that time </s>
<s> will probably take me a few days to get to it though </s>
