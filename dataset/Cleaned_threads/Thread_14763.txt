<s> i have an office with 3 tenants </s>
<s> how can i seperate their networks without havign to buy 3 routers </s>
<s> you need one of the pro grade network hubs that run a few thousand and then you create vlans </s>
<s> frankly why make their network your problem </s>
<s> i ve done this before and supply a complimentary internet access but never solve their network issues </s>
<s> if those companies want their own lans then tell them to make their own </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am inclined to agree </s>
<s> i have an additional 9 offices to manage and i definitely think it will be in my best interest to let them run their own inner office cabling and wiring </s>
<s> seems like a bit of a headache to tackle this on the tenants behalf </s>
<s> thanks r proffitt </s>
