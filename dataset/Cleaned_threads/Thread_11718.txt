<s> desktop maintenance </s>
<s> about once a month i delete all of the files in my recycle bin </s>
<s> i use outlook express and once a month i delete all of the files in the outbox sent items deleted items and drafts </s>
<s> in internet explorer about once a month i delete all of the files temporary internet files cookies history of websites visited and inprivatae filtering data </s>
<s> i don t think i have the knowledge or skills to check the cpu heat sink </s>
<s> this problem is relatively new like a month so i doubt that could be the problem </s>
<s> but if i can t get it fixed i take it in to a shop and tell them to check the heat sink </s>
<s> out of curiosity what are you using for a printer and how do you have it hooked up </s>
<s> not sure if it is you problem but when you read pdf files you sometime see this stalling </s>
<s> it seems sometimes it wants to load a large piece of the file before it displays it but it does not tell you it is still downloading </s>
<s> if you mess with when its in this condition i have had it then refuse to load that document untill i clear all the cache things </s>
<s> for links that are pdf files you can generally get around this right click the link and save as </s>
<s> if you have issue on general web pages that are html only hard to say i tend to blame the firewall virus software first for any strange problems </s>
<s> the cnet video i supplied covers the basics </s>
<s> if you are not doing this yearly then your machine eventually has issues very much like you posted </s>
<s> i have begun to wonder if this is why most folk buy new machines </s>
<s> they don t do the basic maintenance </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> downloading pdg pages from the web are interrupted also </s>
<s> all pages of print from the web are interrupted </s>
<s> if i go to my home page cnbc it isn t interrupted but it probably takes more than 10 seconds to load because there s such a lot of content </s>
<s> the last things to load are the dow nasdaq and s amp p figures and then i can go to other articles or videos offereb by the site </s>
<s> another thing i ve noticed is that while the my computer seems to be stalled or the download is still going on i can move my mouse arrow around but neither the left or right buttons work nor does the wheel word </s>
<s> in addition the arrow doesn t change into an hourglass to indicate it is downloading </s>
