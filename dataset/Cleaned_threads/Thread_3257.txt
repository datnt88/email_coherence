<s> since you have your ssd installed has it lived up to your expectations </s>
<s> does it do what you want or do you find it lacking or even more troublesome than a std </s>
<s> hd </s>
<s> since these have been out for some time and early problems resolved i think just are your thoughts on that </s>
<s> i like to exclude any costs here just your real pc experiences </s>
<s> thanks willy </s>
<s> wasn t looking for the fastest around but just better boot program launch software updates utilities execution and shutdown times vs hdds </s>
<s> got all handily and never bothered with benchmarking </s>
<s> have them in dt and notebooks </s>
<s> no problems if fw is good </s>
<s> unfortunately not all mfrs support their ssds with up to date fw and that has given ssds a bad rap </s>
<s> user reviews will point out the brands that satisfy more than others </s>
<s> not worried about longevity 3 yr warranties cover me with replacements should they die prematurely and i have system image backups in case </s>
<s> after 3 yrs who cares it s time for a new machine anyways small businesses feel differently but they shouldn t because it s a bad decision to stall due to hw wearouts </s>
<s> don t quot store quot data on system drives be they hdds or ssds </s>
<s> therefore only buy ssd up to capacity necessary for os and apps to save money and heartaches </s>
<s> it seems to be a little faster but nothing to brag about </s>
<s> but the price has come down abit which is a good thing </s>
<s> i bought mine for 80 120gb to see just what it s like </s>
