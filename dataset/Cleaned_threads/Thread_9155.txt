<s> i was able to obtain some free office equipment that consisted of a netgear wireless bridge and an axis communications print server </s>
<s> is it possible to create a wireless print server on my home network through a wireless g linksys router without having to go out and buy a wireless print server </s>
<s> i can configure the bridge and printer server seperately via direct connection to the router but could not get anything to print when i hooked up the printer server to the bridge through a crossover cable </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> 2 setup can be an itch </s>
<s> i m going to decline commenting too much here except many won t read the manuals or have the time to learn about ip addressing accounts etc </s>

<s> please spare me the sarcasm </s>
<s> if you don t have anything constructive to post please don t say anything </s>
<s> i m just a networking noob looking for quick help that s all </s>
<s> thanks </s>
