<s> computer constantly running 60 65c 130 150f i think that is too hot for my processor computer makes my room hot also it is not overclocked and i play counterstrike alot i know gaming builds up heat i am now getting constant freezing when playin that game for 10 minutes now it use to be ok not freeze i play it a lot any help </s>
<s> do i need a better heatsink fan for the cpu </s>
<s> what is the best one besides water cooling </s>
<s> computer specs amd athlon xp 2000 1024mb ddr 120g hd 80g hd gigabyte ga 7vtxe motherboard geforce ti4200 graphics card geforce mx420 graphics card 3 cdrom drives 500w ps windows xp pro sp1 updated 3 case fans stock amd heatsink fan dual ps fan </s>
<s> everything we add generates heat </s>
<s> you can get 20 watts less for each hard disk and cd drive you remove from your design </s>
<s> you can drop 10 or so watts by cutting back to 512mb and today s os and games may run with a percentage point on the 1gb setup </s>
<s> the dual display cards add too </s>
<s> the lowest wattage i see is about 35 watts and you may have a 200 watt crt on that as well </s>
<s> i see three to four hundred watts you might be able to drop out of this system including crt and still play the game </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you got all thos goodies stuffed into the system you bet you re generating heat </s>
<s> even with all those case fans they still need to exhaust all the hot air as some get stuck between hds cds drives and such due to spacing wire harnesses and plain bad air flow </s>
<s> open the case and place a household fan to blow in does it improve any </s>
<s> also the hsf should be dusted blown off to best allow the fins full heat disapation to work </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
