<s> greetings all and happy thanksgiving </s>
<s> i am about to come into a sizable sum of money don t worry no one died and my desktop is in sore need of replacing </s>
<s> i don t mean an upgrade i mean a brand new built from scratch custom computer with the best parts available on the consumer market as of right now barring quot collector s pieces quot deliberately produced in limited quantity and the like </s>
<s> i ve always been behind the curve on computer power and this is my chance to make up for it </s>
<s> unfortunately my expertise largely extends to using a computer not knowing its inner workings so i was hoping you guys could be of some help to me in determining which parts are quot best quot </s>
<s> what do i mean by quot best quot </s>
<s> well generally i mean quot fastest quot in regard to cpu and ram a motherboard with a high number of ram slots and other important features highest possible output for a power supply greatest polygon pushing power for a graphics card most effective cooling fans if needed a monitor with huge resolution and good contrast ratio and an audio card that does whatever audio cards do really really well </s>
<s> if there s any important parts i ve left out please feel free to inform me </s>
<s> now that i ve established myself as a complete n00b i was hoping you guys could fill in the blanks </s>
<s> i know there s probably some contention about which parts meet the quality of quot best quot but if so just list the parts you consider quot almost unparalleled in quality quot and hopefully i can use hardware review sites to narrow my choices down from there </s>
<s> sorry for this being such an open ended request but this simply isn t my area of expertise </s>
<s> now head over to tomshardware and go to the top of the list hmm gtx 590 or pair of 570s </s>

<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i ve found going to gamer websites and or 3rd party game pc builders provide enough info to go in the right direction </s>
<s> custom builders that offer a selection provide a basis to compare though you need not buy from them </s>
<s> checkout ibuypower and cyberpower websites </s>
<s> further oem systems supplied from dell and hp using the brand labels xps alien or voodoo are top end pcs </s>
<s> you get a feel by reviewing the specs what s a good match and or something again to compare to from any vendor </s>
<s> as always read the quot fine print quot </s>
