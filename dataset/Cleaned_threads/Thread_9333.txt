<s> price rnage between 0 to 1500 </s>
<s> low cost per page ppm up 30 don t need fax it s moslty all about color and images </s>
<s> we want very good quality </s>
<s> if someone had an idea it will really help us to find out </s>
<s> i ve been in such an office and they learned the hard way that you use a pre press print of your work on the common inkjet then done to the print shop for the high volume high quality prints </s>

<s> the best printer for this is 5 or more figures </s>
<s> the office lessons are something i can share but it appears that folk insist on repeating the lesson </s>
<s> if you want to try getting your own printer why not head to the store and look at print samples </s>

<s> we think the best we can do is to deal with a printing company </s>
<s> they have the material we do the marketing project and we can save up money and gain benefits </s>
<s> i apologize for my rough english i m a french canadian haha </s>
<s> i really appreciate your help </s>
<s> it helps me to ask the right question </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i lived in vancouver bc for many years and that was another office where we would do on screen pre press work then a test print off the current ink jets of the day then off to the print shop for a print that we would check before the final run </s>
<s> today there are many good shops and it pays to read as much as you can about prepress work </s>
<s> here s a tutorial that s less than a sip from the firehose </s>
