<s> win98se p3 800 mhz 256 ram mitsumi cr4804te cd rw this has been a sturdy machine but a couple of lock ups and one blue screen happened </s>
<s> could only restart each with the longheld press on the power button </s>
<s> now i can not play or explore a cd though the d drive is visible in my computer and device manager sees no problem functioning normally </s>
<s> have already dealt the vxd s that can cause conflicts </s>
<s> i searched for newer drivers but there is nothing newer than version 3 0d as far as i can tell </s>
<s> what else can i check </s>

<s> my dad s machine had from memory that same drive </s>
<s> its dead now and while dieing would cause lockup </s>
<s> windows also thought it worked </s>
<s> try another drive </s>

<s> hi bob when the machine locked up the first two times the d drive was not in use </s>
<s> i was trying to open a cd when it did lock the third time </s>
<s> now it is working </s>
<s> i did not do anything much just tried to scan the registry for errors none </s>
<s> then i thought to use the soundcard to play the cd creative live </s>
<s> has a playcenter which can find music sources </s>
<s> the cd rw drive played </s>
<s> then i re installed wmplayer 9 which uses very little resources on this machine and it started to find the songs too </s>
<s> i can not explain the inaccessibility it was not just wmp because i could not open the drive through my computer either </s>
<s> you still believe that the drive is dying </s>
<s> i don t play cds much on it nor use it as a rom but i do burn occasionally with excellent results </s>
<s> i realise it s now 5 years old but it has not done that many miles </s>
<s> cheers faldown </s>
