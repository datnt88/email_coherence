<s> hello i just did a clean reinstall abit kd7a mobo soundblaster live </s>
<s> 5 1 win 2000 but now my audio sounds like its underwater i think it s out of phase somehow </s>
<s> i recall having this problem before but can t remember the fix </s>
<s> creative labs site says my driver is up to date </s>
<s> any ideas on how to fix </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> make sure you have all your chipset drivers that w2k may not have had </s>
<s> via </s>
<s> intel </s>
<s> i agree with refurbb about reinstalling all the various motherboard chipset drivers </s>
<s> i think that most people forget to reinstall the motherboard drivers when they reformat a drive to reinstall the operating system </s>
<s> i my case i know that one of the motherboard drivers is for sound though possibly for the integrated sound on the motherboard </s>
<s> anyway check to see if when you installed the drivers for your soundblaster card it installed any utilities for the card </s>
<s> i m thinking of utilities that allow you to shape the sound for the room you are listening in </s>
<s> these different evironments make the output from your speakers sound different for each environment concert hall living room large room etc </s>
<s> i had a similar problem with my card and i had a heck of a time getting the setting back to where i thought it should be or where i thought it sounded best </s>
<s> you may have the same problem </s>
<s> check start programs and look to see if there are programs related for your card </s>
<s> one might be a configuration utility program </s>
<s> otherwise check in c program files to find a soundblaster folder and check inside for anything that looks like a configuration utility program </s>
<s> or third check the driver cd that came with the sound card </s>
<s> hope it helps </s>
<s> good luck larry </s>
<s> frankzxcv check in device manager to see if the version of the driver that is installed is the most current </s>
<s> assuming that you have the latest drivers you may want to try uninstalling from device manager then reboot letting xp reinstall the hardware </s>
<s> i ve had to do this with other hardware in the past </s>
<s> somehow drivers sometimes don t install properly </s>
<s> thanks for the advice all i was using the driver that came with the card and the creative site has a software checker that told me my driver was up to date but it was wrong </s>
<s> i downloaded and installed the most recent driver and voila everything was fixed fj </s>
<s> frank glad to hear you solved the problem </s>
<s> it seems that all to often on a new install that windows will install some outdated version of the driver </s>
<s> when you check in device manager it says that the device is working properly when in reality it may not </s>
<s> i ve been in that circle before myself </s>
<s> not a lot of fun but a good learning experience </s>
