<s> hi all sorry if this has been asked to death but here is my situation </s>
<s> i ve set up a home network with two xp machines and one win98 machine which is connected to the house s printer </s>
<s> i am currently able to print through the network from the two xp nodes but only when the win98 machine is on </s>
<s> so everytime i want to print i have to run down two floors turn on the old system wait for it to boot 5 min then print </s>
<s> is there a way to set up the printer so i don t have to turn on the win98 machine and just leave the printer on 24 7 ready to print from the xp machines </s>
<s> it s done in offices is it not </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i need a print server don t i </s>
<s> since you already have a working network just put your printer directly quot on the wire quot </s>
<s> you didn t say what type of connection your printer has but even if it s parallel you can buy one for about 50 75 that goes from parallel usb ect to rj45 lan cable and has a web based interface to setup </s>
<s> i ve use in an office environment and it worked well </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> an example </s>
