<s> what are the signs of needing a new dvd r rw drive emachines t5026 pentium 4 3 06 cpu 768 ram windows xp home 160 hard drive basically i have the factory system the same way when i bought it from best buy </s>
<s> are you having any </s>

<s> if you want one then get one </s>
<s> if you need one by all means install one </s>
<s> it s really up to you if no problems are present now </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i don t think i have any problems my dvds burn and play pretty good </s>
<s> i was just thought that after a year of heavy burning dvd and cd the burner would be dead but it seems okay </s>
<s> i did some research on the brand name of the drive tsst corp which is a joint venture between toshiba and samsung </s>
<s> the last firmware upgrade i got maybe fall of 2005 and none since </s>
<s> this is why i think maybe i should get a new burner because they ve stop giving updates meaning that my burner is outdated </s>
<s> maybe i m over reacting i guess if it ain t broke don t fix it </s>
<s> even if you got a new dvd burner it may need an update so don t sweat it if no updates are available for you re current burner </s>
<s> quot if it ain t broke don t fix it quot is alot of common sense </s>
<s> you have the option to replace in the future cross fingers good or bad </s>
