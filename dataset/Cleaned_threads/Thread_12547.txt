<s> i m sort of in a jam </s>
<s> i m looking to buy a printer and scanner for various uses printing plain documents from word processing and the internet as well as scanning documents photo prints and negatives </s>
<s> thing is i d eventually like to print photo quality prints from photographs i will scan </s>
<s> initially i thought well go with an all in one photo printer </s>
<s> but then i wondered if i would be also to use such a printer for regular prints from word processing and such </s>
<s> and if so is this cost effective </s>
<s> or would it be better to buy the one multifunction printer that just prints scans and copies regular documents not photos and buy a small photo printer on the side </s>
<s> yes there are multifunction photoprinters </s>
<s> the difference not always is that they have another ink slot for the photo printing </s>
<s> other documents printing will use different ink compartment </s>
<s> i prefer to use different printer for photo </s>
<s> this is just what i needed to know </s>
<s> thanks once again </s>
