<s> i had a dell system sitting in my living room for a year </s>
<s> it was a system we used for the business which went out of business hence why it hasnt been used the other day i attempted to start it up </s>
<s> it booted to windows normally </s>
<s> the next day i attempted to boot and instead of the system booting i am hearing a series of 4 5 long beeps </s>
<s> the monitor light did not turn green so the system is not starting up </s>
<s> also the cpu fan sounds as if it is spinning at triple speed </s>
<s> the motherboard light is on </s>
<s> i believe its orange not home other wise i would check troubleshooting steps i have already taken i disconnected everything except the monitor </s>
<s> no keyboard no mouse no cd rom drive no floppy no network connection </s>
<s> the issue still occurred </s>
<s> i also disconnected the monitor and it still occurred </s>
<s> for the hell of it i disconnected the hard drive and the same thing occurred </s>
<s> i decided to give it a day and try again </s>
<s> i started the computer up and it did boot to windows </s>
<s> knowing i need to repeat the process i shut it down and tried again </s>
<s> this time as if repeating from yesterday the system did not boot with the same series of beeps and the fan moving in light speed </s>
<s> i tried to start the system up 10 more times and the same errors occurred </s>
<s> if anyone can help im assuming its a hardware problem but motherboard </s>
<s> power supply </s>
<s> hardrive </s>
<s> thank you for any help anyone can give </s>
<s> michael </s>
<s> the beeps are telling you where the problem is if you know how to interprit them call dell up and see if its still under warrenty </s>
<s> if it is get them to fix it if not you may need a new one </s>
<s> note down the beep sequence and then get to dell support website </s>
<s> that sequence will explain what problem its having as determined by the bios error beep code </s>
<s> be absolutely sure of the beeps 4 5 beeps seems not so </s>
<s> if it sounds like long and short beeps note that also </s>
<s> then at dell for your model proceed to determine cause </s>
<s> as another poster mentioned if you have warranty use it </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the beeps sounds like memory problem try taking the memory out then back in if you have more than one stick try just one at a time see if that will help </s>
<s> thank you to everyone who replied it actually was an issue with the ram being partially unseated </s>
<s> so luckily fixing the problem won t end up costing me any money as the warranty has expired </s>
<s> grats and woot </s>
