<s> hi there i have two machines with soyo 6ba motherboards in them i am finally done with various projects i needed them for and can do maintenance on them </s>
<s> both motherboards seem to be working fine but i have the original non updated bios s in both </s>
<s> should i flash them or leave them alone </s>
<s> thanks fj </s>
<s> i did </s>
<s> it was my decision since i had the time to update them because i found the changes worthwhile in where the old boards were </s>
<s> no support for large drives and you can t find under 40gb drives anymore </s>
<s> if nothing else download latest and put in the box for that day </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well the reason i ask is i am afraid of the consequences of screwing it up </s>
<s> i am reasonably experienced but i ve never done this particular task before and many people and bios websites have told me not to do it if not absolutely necessary i guess if the power stays on it should be okay </s>
<s> are there any tricks to it other than reading the instructions </s>
<s> will a bios upgrade allow me to use bigger than 30 gb drives </s>
<s> which i currently cannot use </s>
<s> i have a soyo 6ba and a 6ba iii </s>
<s> fyi tiger direct sells 30 gb seagates for about 60 </s>
<s> thanks fj </s>
<s> that s the reason i updated </s>
<s> 60 bucks gets a new 7200 rpm 80 or larger gb drive </s>
<s> why should i give up space over a bios update </s>
<s> no real tricks </s>
<s> just get the right bios files </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks i ll give it a go </s>

<s> hi there well i finally screwed my courage to the sticking place downloaded the bios upgrade and awardflash </s>
<s> exe followed all instructions and when it asked me if i wanted to save old bios i said sure and it s spitting at me </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i don t think i ve ruined it yet but </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i guess i can t pick my own filename i have to type the name of the current bios </s>
<s> is the old bios file the little sequence of numbers i see at startup </s>
<s> i assume i have to type that in if i want to save the old bios </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> hey there well it took me a while to figure out that while i had to not type the quot exe quot file extension on a gt awdflash i did have to type the quot bin quot extension on the new bios filename </s>
<s> i am up and running and it is recognizing the 40 gb drive now </s>
<s> hooray </s>
<s> how big of a drive can this soyo 6ba mobo recognize now with the bios update ya spose </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> past that and you may be pressing your luck </s>
<s> some motherboard makers have this on their website </s>
