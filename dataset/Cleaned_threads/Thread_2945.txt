<s> i am running windows xp and i just wanted to know if there are any good registry cleaners </s>
<s> my computer is running slow and i assume that that is what i need to do to make it pick up </s>
<s> my internet is slow i have shaw highspeed programs start slowly and my computer just doesn t respond as well anymore </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it s more often choices we made as to how much runs at a time once in awhile issues with antivirus choices free avg </s>
<s> or malware </s>
<s> try a few of this forum s favorite freebies like ccleaner malwarebytes </s>
<s> be cautious with some of that stuff but as bob mentioned doesn t smack of a registry issue </s>
<s> i would start out with malwarebytes to check for malware then i would download advanced windowscare try the beta3 </s>
<s> it is easy and does no harm </s>
<s> if you don t want that cc cleaner is another that does no harm and is good easy to use </s>
<s> superantispyware </s>
<s> i have used it and malwarebytes </s>
<s> these freebies found items that adaware and spybot s d didn t find </s>
<s> my husband uses cccleaner and mr fussy is very pleased with it </s>
<s> i like registry fix which is not free but worth the money it has a super simple interface you can customize it and i have never felt uncomfortable using it </s>
<s> it tells you what it did asks you if you want to save or repair and that s it </s>
<s> no scary stuff </s>
<s> always back up the registry </s>
<s> the software asks you if you want to back it up </s>
<s> i ve used ccleaner for a long time it s very safe and never had an issue with it </s>
<s> i have been using quot regcure quot by paretologic technologies for several years without major problems </s>
<s> also i use in conjuction with it quot system mechanic pro 8 quot by iolo technologies ccleaner and a new one i stumbled upon quot netcom3 quot which will optimize your registry search for parasites and can be used side by side with your current antivirus program </s>
<s> it includes pop up blockers site guards system back up and more </s>
<s> the two i like most are system mechanic which i ve use around 5 years now it will speed up your internet connection you speak of as well as many other individual utilities within it to keep your computer running in top shape </s>
<s> my second favorite i used in the last six months or so netcom3 </s>
<s> a good defragmentation program such as quot diskeeper quot will help if you do a lot of uninstalling downloading ect like i do </s>
<s> good luck check them out </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> registry repair by stompsoft works great its easy not expensive </s>
<s> at costco it is 25 </s>
<s> i have used it when needed for at least 6 years </s>
<s> i use the excellent simple glary utilities freeware </s>
<s> it has a simple one click cleaner and also lets you wipe empty tracks though on internet explorer only </s>
<s> dell tech support tells me that registry cleaners are unnecessary </s>
<s> if you tend to download and uninstall a number of programs apps and games uninstall does not clean out everything </s>
<s> example if you have yahoo messenger installed and then uninstall quot it the right way and then check in the registry you will find the entire installation still sitting there right down to the executable bits </s>
<s> the only way to remove them without a registry cleaner is one at a time hundreds and hundreds of bits </s>
<s> every time you download anything on your computer when you delete it it leaves a fingerprint behind in the registry </s>
<s> a cleaner will go after those fingerprints cleaning out all the loose flappy things that don t belong to anything anymore dll files missing files bits of games and apps you thought you had deleted years ago </s>
<s> they dont do any harm perhaps but over time they build up </s>
<s> when i installed registryfix i had about 200 of those things in the registry </s>
<s> now i get maybe two or three a week and can manage them nicely </s>
<s> hello i think you must use a anti spyware kaspersky internet security also you must use quot ccleaner quot goodluck </s>
<s> unless you re seriously expert in your technical understanding of the windows registry say one in one hundred windows users sort of expert </s>
<s> i would not recommend messing with your windows registry at all unless you re expert </s>
<s> items like ccleaner registry cleaner and similar have caused more blue screens of death bsod for windows users than any other product class that i know of </s>
<s> if you want to get rid of the gunk from your system that windows builds in the temp files folders browser caches etc try atf cleaner from but because your system is running noticeably slow it probably has little to do with some accumulated junk that needs cleaning </s>
<s> the problem short of a system infection which others have addressed here might probably be a hardware related one </s>
<s> contact your manufacturer hp dell lenovo etc with the problem or go to their website </s>
<s> most of the big manufacturers have system hardware diagnostics programs and driver update programs for each machine they built </s>
<s> run these diagnostics programs and make the needed updates recommended on their site </s>
<s> if the machine s still running far too slow after getting your needed and recommended oem updates you have to decide whether it s smarter to send it in for repair for whatever they ll charge or whether it s smarter to put it off to the side and invest in a new system </s>
<s> i trust cccleaner i have tried also advanced windows care v2 personal and also glary utilities </s>
<s> i believe in registry cleaners </s>
<s> i think you should use them </s>
<s> first read them carefully and work with settings </s>
<s> second you should check start menu </s>
<s> maybe there are few softs that start together with the sistem </s>
<s> advanced windows care v2 personal is very good at this </s>
<s> if there are few softs to start with the sistem they will slow the sistem of course </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i agree i trust the concept of registry cleaners but unless im comfortable with the process involved i won t use one </s>
<s> there are scams out there sure </s>
<s> but most of it is common sense </s>
<s> my husband who has never used one was having a problem with something on the computer that he couldnt resolve </s>
<s> he got ccleaner and cleaned it right out </s>
<s> i am familiar with the registry enough to know how to deal with it how to stop processes from working how to clean it by hand </s>
<s> now and then it s necessary </s>
<s> too many people yes can muck up what they have by seeing funny names in there and deleting everything in sight </s>
<s> it also helps to understand its purpose which is to be a repository for every bloody thing that ever crosses your computer window </s>
<s> you have to do your homework </s>
<s> i like mine my husband likes his </s>
<s> we re comfortable with them both </s>
<s> frankly nav caused me more headaches than a registry cleaner every has </s>
<s> you have work to do and many answers here s another one first my os is windows xp home edition sp2 celeron 1 7ghz processor </s>
<s> my opinion is before you spend any money on shareware try freeware </s>
<s> 1 run antivirus avast4 8 avgfree mcafeefree etc </s>
<s> 2 defrag your hd iobit smartdefrag 3 cm diskcleaner v2 1 7 i ve been using it about 4 years it makes for you a restore point of your system before anything also has disk cleaner gt clean garbage on disks applications cleaner gt old entries not removed optimize ram file eraser gt prevent recovery tools to find delete files one clip clean up gt clean pc fast easy bob good luck by the way yes registry is a delicate issue and i m not an expert neither but we try to help each other </s>
<s> what you are saying about registry cleaners being all bad is probably a holdover from the days when they were new and a bit shaky around the edges </s>
<s> it s also like saying quot my dad had a chevy truck and it was a lemon and refuse to even consider another chevy anything ever because someone else had a bad experience </s>
<s> learn from the bad experiences but don t let it color your own attitudes about stuff to the point where you lose more than you gain by avoidance </s>
<s> and yes try a freebie that will give you a demo first look at what they find do your homework by finding forums for that cleaner online and what problems they re having </s>
<s> dont listen to the hype in the ads </s>
<s> listen to users </s>
<s> mittens </s>
<s> you missed the point about i trust in reg cleaners comes from two quotes of user s answers one said quot the dell techs says reg cleaners doesn t work quot the other one says quot we are not expert the pc registry is delicate quot so i just gave him an option there s another good software out there i ve never choosed a product before listen what the users say about it i never follow the quot hype ads quot i guess it was a bad interpretation anyways tku for your reply </s>
<s> fair enough </s>
<s> there is a great registry cleaner i use call lt a href quot gt ms errors lt a gt i use it on my both pc s with different os one is xp the other is vista </s>
<s> this registry cleaner fixed many errors i had and the slow preformance i had </s>
<s> i recommend that soft but use what you think is the best for you </s>
