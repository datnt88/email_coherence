<s> actually i have a usb hub that is no longer recognizing the drive </s>
<s> it was working fine and then nothing </s>

<s> any ideas would be helpful </s>
<s> i had a somewhat similar issue with my dell laptop </s>
<s> i bought the 1 gb jumpdrive traveller from best buy and it would not recognize on my laptop </s>
<s> i exchanged it and the same thing resulted </s>
<s> i do own an fmi 512 mb drive from compusa works great never a problem </s>
<s> i did a test with a usb extension cable came with my digital camera and the jumpdrive worked fine </s>
<s> i found that the jumpdrive does not quot fit quot very well with my dell usb ports </s>

<s> thank you for contacting dell technical support </s>
<s> i understand your concern regarding the lexar jumpdrive and this is a known issue with lexar jump drives </s>
<s> please note that lexar jump drive would not work in the front usb ports this is because the front usb ports are passive ports and do not provide initialization power which may be required by some of the usb devices to function there is not enough power in the front ports of computer for usb flash drives to work </s>
