<s> hi i have just recieved a hp photosmart 2610 printer and i want to connect it to my wireless network </s>
<s> it has and ethernet port so i decided i would connect my ethanet to wireless bridge d link to the printer and then connect it straight to my home network </s>
<s> i have a belkin router modem with wep security ect </s>
<s> i also have the hp networking guide and cd rom however all my laptops are vista so it wont work also once i get it hooked up to the network how do i get it to apear on all my laptops </s>
<s> if any other information is needed just ask </s>
<s> thanks tom </s>
<s> at this point i d pack it back up and return it before you can t get your money back </s>
<s> next time ask if it works with vista </s>
<s> sorry i didnt explain quite right i got the printer for free it is a few years old an since then i was able to get the setup wizard to work but still could not get it connected to the internet the main problem i am having is getting the bridge to connect with the router and reconise it as a printer all suggestions are helpful </s>
<s> thanks tom </s>
<s> can be found here </s>
<s> disconnect your printer </s>
<s> please make sure to un install the printer then restart the computer before installing the proper drivers </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> hi i have installed the drivers but i get the message that the printer is not connected to my network </s>
<s> the main problem i am having is getting my wireless bridge to communicate with my wireless router </s>
<s> thanks tom </s>
<s> wep s dead today </s>
<s> i also see you note a bridge </s>
<s> sadly your posts are incomplete so replies fail to get to the answers since you haven t made a good complete post </s>
<s> solve one issue at a time </s>
<s> such as that bridge </s>
<s> to try to solve the printer and the bridge at the same time will usually be too hard </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what i want the bridge to do is connect with my wireless router </s>
<s> this is the thing that is giving me the most problems </s>
<s> the bridges instructions are incoplete and unhelpful so mabye you can help me </s>
<s> the bridge is a d link dwl g810 and my router is belcon branded </s>
<s> my router was set up with a security key </s>
<s> i fyou need anymore information please ask </s>
<s> thanks for your help tom </s>
<s> i see from it s setup that this is not going to be easy enough for me to solve here </s>
<s> while i have setup these things unless i was privy to every detail it s too likely what i didn t know had an error </s>
<s> find a local network guru and offer pizza and cherry coke and accolades to get this all working </s>
<s> in closing i used this one gt wgps606 see google com its instructions are no better but since i used to write embedded web servers and routers a long time ago it wasn t all that hard to see what they wanted me to do </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you very much for your help it is much appreciated </s>
<s> i will explore some other options </s>
<s> thanks again your help is much appreciated </s>
<s> tom </s>
<s> skip trying to get the printer on the bridge </s>
<s> try your pc or laptop and no offense intended and their instructions </s>
<s> this one is not easy so don t feel to bad if it takes a few tries </s>
<s> hi sorry to bother you again </s>
<s> i tried connecting my bridge into my laptop i found the home page in internet explorer and it will connect to my network but when i get on i can not connect to the internet </s>
<s> what settings hould i check </s>
<s> also should i set up an ap </s>
<s> does this make the connection easier if so how o i do this thanks tom </s>
<s> on any laptop to disable it s wifi </s>
<s> my hp acer s have a little button for that </s>
<s> now i use ethernet to the bridge and follow the directions </s>
<s> i m not privy to what you may have changed on the bridge so let me note that i use the bridge s defaults and only set the ssid and password word to the wifi network i want to connect to </s>
<s> remember not to lock down any ip here </s>
<s> we want to get it to work as a bridge first </s>
<s> good luck </s>
