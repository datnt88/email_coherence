<s> i have two old gateway pc s that i have cobbled together with spare parts </s>
<s> one has all of the oem software with keycodes </s>
<s> i have installed ubuntu on both of them </s>
<s> one of them is a p3 700 with 192 mb of ram and a 20 gb hard drive </s>
<s> the other is a p3 550 with 320 mb of ram and 2 hard drives </s>
<s> os on a 10 gb and the data drive is a 20 gb </s>
<s> along with crt monitors keyboards and mice and speakers i plan on taking the machines to goodwill </s>
<s> unless i can find someone in need of a pc i will take them tomorrow </s>
<s> any idea on value of them </s>
<s> they both work </s>
<s> the one with the least memory has a nic card i was just surfing the internet with it a few minutes ago </s>
<s> the other pc only has a modem installed </s>
<s> but for example a new laptop starts at 299 so at best 1 2 that and only if there are legitimate cds for the os and what s loaded </s>

<s> i have the gateway software package that came new with one of the machines </s>
<s> along with it 98se the keycodes and gateway recovery disk </s>
<s> i had to put a nic card in it clean the lint and dirt installed a new cmos battery </s>
<s> i installed ubuntu on both machines </s>
<s> i was going to offer them to someone for 50 apiece includes crt monitor mouse and keyboard speakers </s>
<s> i just wondered if that was too much </s>
