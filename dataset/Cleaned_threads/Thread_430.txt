<s> one purchase an isa or pci card to run an internal floppy </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but the sad truth is that i don t see such a card </s>
<s> the issue here is that a motherboard could cost about the same </s>
<s> what motherboard is this </s>
<s> what cpu and such parts do you need to move over </s>

<s> ray check this out </s>
<s> looks as it is for an isa slot </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ray try some wd 40 on the micro switches just inside the flip door </s>
<s> the one on the right looking in is the write protect and the one on the left is the media sensor switch </s>
<s> what i have found in many cases is that those switches get gummy from the atmosphere and do not actuate properly when you insert a floppy particularly the media sensor </s>
<s> if this stays down in a stuck position the drive thinks it has a 720 disk but your command has told it that it was a 1 44 therefore you may get a message quot cannot read disk not formatted etc quot a little wd 40 on the finger nubs with working a disk in and out frees up these switches and often puts the drive back in service </s>
<s> its worth a try i fixed one this past weekend for a friend </s>
<s> norm </s>
<s> also check the mother board floppy plug slot to see if a pin is bent down against another pin sometimes these slots are not indexed missing a pin and some one uses a indexed cable blank space on the cable connector bending the pin down while forcing the cable in the slot </s>

<s> this idiot was building a new computer and setting up the old one for another user </s>
<s> the old one was using an ls120 ide drive as the floppy </s>
<s> this was needed for the new computer which had the old hard drive with quickbooks on it </s>
<s> used it to back up quickbooks </s>
<s> now two years ago this same idiot disabled the floppy controller because at that time the system didn t have a floppy drive </s>
<s> guess what happened when i enabled the floppy controller in the bios </s>
<s> now i have an isa controller that can handle a bunch of floppies </s>
<s> anyone need it </s>
