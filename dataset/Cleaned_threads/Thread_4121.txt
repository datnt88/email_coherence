<s> the following machine is going to be the general purpose family machine </s>
<s> this means that it will mostly be used for web surfing office utilities etc </s>
<s> no one in the family is a gamer yet so it does not need to be optimized for gaming </s>
<s> i might hook it up to the entertainment system for the digital home experience but im not dead set on that </s>
<s> the one thing i do want it optimized for is video editing </s>
<s> for the past three years i have been using pinnacle studio versions 8 and 9 on my dell x300 to do video editing </s>
<s> i will keep using this for a while on the new machine but ultimately want to jump to something more high end </s>
<s> since i havent decided which editor to go with when i do upgrade adobe avid vegas i am getting a cheapish video card right now </s>
<s> so i need a decent stable system that is capable of low end video editing right now and can be upgraded in the near future </s>
<s> oh yeah and i probably will not be doing much tweaking although overclocking still remains a possibility </s>
<s> the following set up is just about the limit of what i can spend </s>
<s> as far as the alternate options go i can probably add up to 100 but that is it i e all of the alternate options are not a possibility </s>
<s> any and all feedback is more than welcome </s>

<s> note 2 i have to decide whether to go with 1gig of high quality memory or 2 gigs of value memory note 3 this will be upgraded when i decide which higher end video editor i will go with </s>
<s> choose the e6400 but a plain p5b instead </s>
<s> here s a feature comparison </s>
<s> unless you need dual gigabit lan dolby audio dual x16 graphics slots crossfire firewire ecc ram or matrix raid the p5b should be sufficient </s>
<s> if you re not going to use the features why pay for them </s>
<s> the 965 chipset actually overclocks better than the 975 chipset and its just as stable if not more stable </s>
<s> for video editting use most modern gpus perform the same </s>
<s> still i d get at least a 7300gt so vista s aero interface won t be sluggish </s>
<s> go with 2x1gb of fast memory </s>
<s> i prefer ddr2 667 with agressive timings to ddr2 800 for better stability but ddr2 533 value ram is needlessly slow </s>
<s> the sonata ii is a very quiet case </s>
<s> consider the p180 only if you want its looks need an even quieter case or plan on serious overclocking </s>
<s> you ve strung out a lot of tech specs why don t you just buy a mac </s>
<s> hey some advice from an editor here </s>
<s> decide on which edit system you want to go with first if you want to go more high end then you should know that the edit suites are picky with video cards and the like </s>
<s> especially avid if you have an ati and want to go avid you re s o l </s>
<s> the main pro edit applications these days are avid and final cut pro for the mac with premiere pro at second </s>
<s> even then you ll want to check premiere s specs </s>
<s> even for low end editing i d get an nvidia quadro card of some sort </s>
<s> high end edit machines tend to work best when you use them as edit suites alone and lose the msn ish junk on there as well </s>
<s> avid doesn t even like it when i have wallpaper on my pc </s>
<s> three years ago i assembled a system i thought would be more than adequate for hobbyist video production </s>
<s> one erroneous idea that led to problems was my naieve assumption that one of the then highest rated video pvr solutions ati all in wonder 9800 pro and one of the then most recommended audio solutions creative soundblaster audigy 2 ex would make a superior combination </s>
<s> the two devices never worked well together </s>
<s> after my purchases i discovered that the big pc vendors including dell s online pc configuration tools the ones you use to choose all the options before placing a purchase would not permit the buyer selecting those two components for the same pc </s>
<s> since then i have used dell s and other companies online pc selection tools as a first pass method for research compatibility issues </s>
<s> each manufacturer should also provide compatibility info on its web site </s>
<s> i managed to get my system to hobble along but in retrospect should have either done more research or purchased a pre assembled pc from a mainline vendor </s>
<s> incidentally though it is possible to put together a pc that will suffice for hobbiest multimedia production my next multimedia computer will be a mac as another writer suggested </s>
<s> mark h albuquerque </s>
<s> buying ram that s faster than the system components design speed </s>
<s> all things considered i d go with 2gbs vice 1gb </s>
<s> that way your ram needs will be covered for this system and os and perhaps one os upgrade vista </s>
<s> also check asus qvl for ram compatability and also see the asus forum on the mb you ve chosen </s>
<s> you can avoid lots of hassles by doing some advance research </s>
<s> believe most users are reporting better compatibility with corsair ram </s>
<s> the other thing is how are you planning to backup your data files </s>
<s> let us know how it turns out </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> you need to things for video editing machine </s>
<s> the more ram the better minimum 1gb </s>
<s> cpu with good amount of cpu cache </s>
<s> i was able to do video editing with my medion 2 8ghz pc with 1gb memory a ti4200 video card used the onboard sound card and had two seperate hd s </s>
<s> one for software and one for data </s>
<s> it handled any game i put on it and did the video editing just fine using adobe premiere 6 5 and sony vegas 5 to be realistic and keep you in the current ballpark i would suggest a 3 2gh p4 with 1gb of memory any decent video card two seperate hd s not a partition and a dedicated firewire card </s>
<s> do some reading at and you will see what i m talking about </s>
<s> you could also use an athlon 3800 range pc </s>
<s> the 2 8ghz will do real time video editing but the 3 2ghz p4 is quite a bit faster </s>
<s> speed costs money </s>
<s> if it isn t important than go with anything bigger than the 2 8ghz </s>
