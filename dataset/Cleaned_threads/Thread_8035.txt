<s> i have a sony vaio pcv rz50cg i keep getting a low space error </s>
<s> so i do a disk clean up and that is good for about a hour but then it needs it again </s>
<s> my c drive is 13 9 gb with 159mb of free space left my d drive is 212 gb with 3 25 gb free space left </s>
<s> i know my d drive is filled with media center files that i can transfer to dvd but im having trouble with my c drive </s>
<s> i try to scan it and see what files i can erase </s>
<s> all the temp files and cookies get deleted but that dosent help the problem </s>
<s> i come across so many files that i dont know what they do and i dont want to erase them and not have the computer not start up next time </s>
<s> does anyone have any ideas on getting rid of mystery files or if there is a software that would scan my computer and tell me if i need them or not </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> 13 9 gigs is fairly small </s>
<s> even you secondary drive is getting full </s>
<s> you might get a much larger drive than your existing secondary and transfer the data to that one and use your existing secondary as the primary </s>
<s> there are some files you can manually delete that might help </s>
<s> all of your windows update files can probably go </s>
<s> if you have xp these are in your windows folder </s>
<s> if you have your advanced power settings set to allow hibernation turn that off and remove the file it creates which is about 512 megs </s>
<s> if you have adequate physical ram reduce the size of your swap file </s>
<s> if you use ie configure it to delete cache upon exiting </s>
<s> if you use another browser reduce the cache size allocated </s>
<s> you can also reduce the size allocated to system restore </s>
<s> all of this might get back a couple gigs but it does look like a new drive is in order </s>
<s> either buy a larger drive or go to your control panel click on add remove programs go down the program list if you don t use it uninstall it </s>
<s> you should keep at least 500 meg or more freed up </s>
<s> grab a copy of this and let it scan see what it finds </s>
<s> do some house cleaning in the mail area these files can get huge </s>
