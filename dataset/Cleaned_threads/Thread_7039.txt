<s> would i be able to use an ati radeon x1300 512mb agp graphics card with an abit av8 motherboard and an amd athlon 64 x2 dual core processor </s>
<s> if not what cards would work </s>
<s> i d mainly be using my computer for digital photography microsoft office and a few games </s>
<s> i believe the av8 motheroard has agp slot </s>
<s> and just a search away too </s>
<s> search abit av8 listed specification shows support for an agp 4x 8x complaint graphics card and athlon 64 x2 cpu </s>
<s> x1300 comparison places it right at the bottom in almost every game but as long as the quot few quot games quot are at low res low aa af and a few years old it might just scrape through </s>
<s> ati x1600 nv 6600gt offer far more power and longer game lifespan for a little extra outlay </s>
<s> good luck geebee </s>
<s> don t be fooled by the 512mb into thinking this card is more than it is </s>
<s> it s an entry level card and more ram won t help it perform better in anything </s>
<s> an x1600pro w 256mb is a better choice </s>
<s> 120 inc shipping </s>
<s> thank you for your input </s>
<s> i am not positive if i want to purchase that card now </s>
<s> i guess i will rethink it </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
