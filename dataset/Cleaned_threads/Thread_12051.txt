<s> sorry thats a pun my query is about memory i currently have 1 stick of memory in my machine kingston 256mb 333mhz ddr pc2700 what i m confused about is the 333mnz and the pc2700 parts i m looking for more memory but i m not sure if i need to buy the same i e pc2700 and 333mhz can i mix and match </s>
<s> for instance the one i m looking at is 512mb 400mhz pc3200 will this have any effect </s>
<s> rnning p4 2 4gb and xp pro </s>
<s> thanks goofs </s>
<s> well the answer is yes and know if you do indeed get different memory they might play together and they might not </s>
<s> through past experience this is the case </s>
<s> if they do they will run at the slower of the two speeds if they don t you have spent for just the 512 which should run ok on your machine maybe </s>
<s> i hope this helps and i don t seem like an idiot but this is just the way it works with memory </s>
<s> so for my i would match the memory </s>
<s> the easy answer is there is no easy answer to your question </s>
<s> your best bet is to match what you have now but you can always refer to your mainboad specs for a better answer </s>
<s> if your computer didn t come with a mainboard manual it s usally possible to look up the manual on line </s>
<s> simply open up your computer and scan the motherboard for a manufaturer name and model number then do a google search or visit the manufacturers website </s>
<s> if there doesn t appear to be a manufacturer name or model number look instead for an fcc id number and go to the fcc id website and type in the id numbers for your mainboard </s>
<s> you should be able to figure out who made your board and where their website is located from such a search </s>
<s> i can tell you from experience that most newer mainboards require matched memory in banks </s>
<s> for instance if you have 4 memory slots slots 1 and 3 must be a matched pair while slots 2 and 4 must be a pair also </s>
<s> though this varies from one manufacturer to another </s>
<s> my current asus a8n sli mainboard is really picky and not only requires matched pairs but only seems to work with certain brands of higher end memory </s>
<s> the asus website has a list of all the memory that is known to work with my board so i try to stick to that list </s>
<s> i should probably mention that just because a computer came from dell or gateway or whoever that doesn t mean it s mainboard was manufactured by them </s>
<s> in fact i don t think any major computer retailer makes their own mainboards </s>
<s> they usually buy them in bulk from companies such as gigabyte or soyo </s>
<s> most decent mainboards will be marked with a manufaturer name and model number or fcc id </s>
<s> i have run across a few mainboards without any identifying marks at all not even an fcc id </s>
<s> in this case you ll have to contact the system builder to ask them for specs on the mainboard </s>
