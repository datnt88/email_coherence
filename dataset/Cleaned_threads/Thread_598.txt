<s> i have a emachines t3120 with a sempron 3100 </s>
<s> i have tried many times to overclock the cpu but the bios is crippled by emachines </s>
<s> there are no overclock options </s>
<s> i have tried to use software to overclock but the overclock is never saved </s>
<s> it reverts back to the original speed every time i restart my pc </s>
<s> people have been telling me that it is possible to overclock an emachines with a little know how like getting a third party bios </s>
<s> my motherboard is a fic k8mc51g and there is no bios updates </s>
<s> can anybody help me thanks </s>
<s> if dell emachines let you overclock you might and then call in for support for the crashing machine </s>
<s> it s proper for name brand machines to never offer such </s>

<s> your sempron is freq locked to the bus and you can t oc it w o cutting traces resoldering messy stay away </s>
<s> it is a 754 pin cpu running at 1800 mhz and in that package the family freq tops out at 2000 mhz so that is an indicator you won t get much gain even if you go down the messy route </s>
<s> you may be able to replace the cpu with an athlon64 but don t waste your money if the bios doesn t support athlons </s>
<s> besides athlon64 isn t real cheap </s>
<s> stick with your pc until you have the money to buy a fancier one </s>
<s> so dell gateway emachines sony and other major pc manufacturers all don t allow u to overclock their pc s </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> how could they stay in business </s>
