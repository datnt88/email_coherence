<s> i have a new pc with adequate dram and a great chip to run vista ultimate and a laptop running vista home premium </s>
<s> since i have used wired networks before with dsl service i am guessing using a cable modem won t cause any problems </s>
<s> first since i have to push the 60 feet of cat5e wire through existing 2x6 walls and con t know exactly where the 110v wires are located is it essential to use a wire locator to keep the cat5e wire far enough away from the electrical circuit so as not to compromise the signal so it drops </s>
<s> second i have purchased a linksys befsr41 cable dsl router with a 4 port switch for my network because i used the same router 8 years ago for my dsl modem and had no problems with speed or setup </s>
<s> is there a better wired router i should consider befoe i unwrap my befsr41 </s>
<s> third once i have the laptop connected to the router should i buy a printer hub to connect my hp laserjet 1300 and my officejet 6210 to the router or should i connect both printers to my pc and use printer and file sharing to enable my laptop to connect to both printers </s>
<s> fourth i have a termaltake housing for a 500mb western digital external hardrive that has both a esata and a usb2 0 port </s>
<s> i also have a linksys network storage link with two usb2 0 ports and an rj45 ethernet port </s>
<s> should i connect the external hard drive directly to the pc using the esata port and then access the external hard drive using printer files sharing with my laptop </s>
<s> or should i connect my linksys network storage link to one of the ports of the befsr41 and keep my external hard drive connected to the network storage link so i can backup my files and folders on the external hard drive </s>

<s> quot is it essential to use a wire locator to keep the cat5e wire far enough away from the electrical circuit so as not to compromise the signal so it drops quot no </s>
<s> the twisted pairs are there to negate such pickups </s>
<s> i ll decline explaining why this is so </s>

<s> if that works for you </s>
<s> that s a rather dated but fine product </s>
<s> 3 third once i have the laptop connected to the router should i buy a printer hub to connect my hp laserjet 1300 and my officejet 6210 to the router or should i connect both printers to my pc and use printer and file sharing to enable my laptop to connect to both printers </s>
<s> absolutely your choice </s>

<s> gt wow you got esata working </s>
<s> that s fabulous </s>
<s> most owners can crack that nut </s>
<s> again it s your choice on the setup </s>
<s> 5 or should i connect my linksys network storage link to one of the ports of the befsr41 and keep my external hard drive connected to the network storage link so i can backup my files and folders on the external hard drive </s>
<s> again this is your choice </s>
<s> i like the direct usb connection since nas speed is abotu 1 5 that of a direct usb connection </s>
<s> that s sluggish </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob for taking the time to read and respond to each of my questions </s>
<s> you say that the befsr41 us a dated product </s>
<s> do you know of a better router for wired networks </s>
<s> i don t need to keep the linksys wired router </s>
<s> it sounds like keeping the linksys network storage link and using the usb2 0 link to the router is your favored choice </s>
<s> it is easy to do and only saves a few bucks to keep the network storage link </s>
<s> i am also grateful to better understand the way twisted pairs work in the cat5e wires as i don t really know where the 110v circuit is located in the wall and now i can get the job done without worrying about where it is </s>
<s> last question i once was told that sharp bends in cat5e wires compromise the speed of the signal </s>
<s> is this bolderdash or true </s>
<s> many thanks bob </s>
<s> it s a physics electronics effect </s>
<s> read hopefully this will suffice for the explanation </s>
<s> the sharp bends would have to be quite severe to create an issue </s>
<s> you won t see this issue if you let the wire quot flow quot and don t stress it over an 90 degree edge </s>
<s> as to a better router i found the befsr41 to not handle pc to pc traffic all that well </s>
<s> if i connected my befsr41 to a switched hub the network performed better </s>
<s> this has turned out to be true with most routers of that day </s>
<s> today s units are usually better </s>
<s> try to use what gear you have </s>
<s> you seem to be very close to a working system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the link to wikipedia for the explanation of twisted pair technology </s>
<s> i have an unopened box for a d link dir 655 wireless router that i was going to return for credit </s>
<s> would it make any sense to use this router for a wired network since it probably has more updated technology unlike the linksye befsr41 that is from the dark ages </s>
<s> if i connect a switched hub to my befsr41 wired router why will the pc to pc traffic move faster </s>
<s> forgive me for asking these educational questions because it takes far too much of your time to answer them and direct me to helpful sites but maybe someday i can help someone else with the same problem </s>
<s> thanks for the advice and help thomboy </s>
<s> quot if i connect a switched hub to my befsr41 wired router why will the pc to pc traffic move faster quot because the switched hub in the befsr41 doesn t keep up with 100mb transfers </s>
<s> even the cheapest switches hubs helped curb the time when i copy a file between machines </s>
<s> since routers were pricey back then i would connect up the modem gt router gt switched hub gt pcs to get the best overall network speed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> many thanks again bob for the clarification about the switched hub </s>
<s> i should be able to find an inexpensive one and complete the network without problems due to your help </s>
<s> question is there any reason to use the d link dir 655 wireless router in place of the befsr41 for my wired network </s>
<s> i have been told over and over that using a wireless router for a wired network is ok but wireless is more expensive </s>
<s> comment the d link dir 655 cost me 129 while the befsr41 cost 65 </s>
<s> a cheap switched hub can t cost more than 30 or 95 versus 129 </s>
<s> if the d link is better i don t mind spending 34 more for better long term use </s>
<s> thanks again for the reply thomboy </s>
<s> i m a little taken aback with the prices you listed </s>
<s> my recent upgrade was a netgear wpnt 834 for 69 bucks refurb from geeks com </s>
<s> i found a buffalo whr hp g54 for 49 bucks on sale at best buy which is doing a stint running a linux based router firmware since i wanted to do that for some time </s>
<s> the gigabit wifi router is a nice touch since i doubt you ll replace that any day soon </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob i bought the gigabit d link dir 655 from costco but saw them advertised at cnet from other places for over 170 </s>
<s> i bought the bdfsr41 from best buy as it was the only wired router they had in stock </s>
<s> maybe the buffalo you bought would work for me </s>
<s> since i don t need the wi fi function of the dir 655 now maybe using it is overkill </s>
<s> the think all the n and pre n routers are pricey with lots of problems setup and even firmware downloads </s>
<s> even d link s technical support is lacking if trouble comes along with sub net mask dhcp or ip addresses </s>
