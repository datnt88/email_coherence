<s> i am currently trying to build a computer for my daughter </s>
<s> i purchased a abit nf8 v motherboard and amd sempron processor bundle along with a western digital 40 gig hdd a nvidia g force fx5200 video card 512 meg kingston memory and a 350 watt power supply </s>
<s> after assembly the memory and video card work fine the board and processor come up but will not recognize the hdd at all nor will it recognize the cd rom </s>
<s> any ideas or suggestions </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i have a computer similiar to yours mines is equipped with a anthlon xp 2400 2 0 ghz </s>
<s> and i have 640 mb </s>
<s> or ram a geforce fx 5700ve 160 gb </s>
<s> of hard drive space and this sucka really isn t a good gaming performer for me </s>
<s> if gaming isn t your thing then your pc is quite decent but if you game then you could just forget about it </s>
<s> sata pata </s>
<s> exactly what ports on the mobo are they attached to </s>
<s> exactly how are they jumpered </s>
<s> are you using an 80 conductor ribbon cable </s>
<s> what settings re the drives are made in the bios </s>
<s> the hdd is a western digital wd400 the dvd cd rom is a btc 8x 8x combo drive </s>
<s> what ports they are on </s>
<s> primary ide secondary ide western digital drives have somewhat unusual jumpering if you are not using cable select jumpering and a ribbon cable that supports cs all 80 conductor 40 pin cables support cs </s>
<s> for normal maste slave jumpering the wd drives use different jumpering if it is to be a masrter and there is to not be a slave on the ribbon cable </s>
<s> if it is to be a master and a slave to be on the ribbon cable and the slave must be there all the time </s>
<s> actually as master with no slave there is no jumper however in order to have a jumper available if needed they put the jumper horizontally just for storage thuus that is actually no jumper as far as the drive configuration is concerned </s>
<s> now if using cable select cs csel the master drive must be connected to the end connector and the slave connected to the middle connector </s>
<s> not always nice if the hard drive is low in the case and the atapi drive higher up in the case </s>
<s> if you have two ide ports on the mobo easiest to attach each to a different cable </s>
<s> thanks ray you were right on target the hdd was jumpered as a master with no slave on board </s>
<s> many thanks for you assistance couldn t have done it without you </s>
