<s> i recently bought a seagate 160 gb external hd to use as a backup </s>
<s> prior to this i would save any documents on floppies but now with digitial photos and program disks missing not lost just temporarily misplaced i wanted to be able to do a full backup </s>
<s> when i used the xp backup wizard i received an error stating that i could not create a file lager than 4gb due to fat32 formatting on the external drive </s>
<s> my question is there someway around this in backup do i have to reformat the external drive in ntfs or do i have to buy 3rd party software </s>
<s> thanks rick </s>
<s> what feature does msbackup have that is worthy </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i assume that if a virus struck my computer that i could just reformat the hard drive drag and drop back from my external drive and everything would work ok i thought that msbackup would compress everything and simplify the restore process </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> msbackup can t restore to a blank drive </s>
<s> at least with simpler copy methods all your files are saved </s>
<s> gt maybe a solution like acronis should be explored </s>
