<s> ok i just got a radeon x1900xtx </s>
<s> i noticed it came with a composite as well as an s video cable does this mean i could plug this into my pc and then plug my playstation 2 into it and play console games on my pc monitor </s>
<s> you supplied a chip make number but not the make model of the video card so i can t tell if it has video in which would make this possible </s>
<s> some see the cable and think aha this should work but don t think about the ins and outs </s>

<s> oops haha sorry </s>
<s> it s video in if it does allow me to plug a playstation 2 into it it does i tried but not sure if that s what it s meant for how would i go about having it display on screen </s>
<s> i dont see any kind of option for that </s>
<s> oh and not sure on the make model </s>
<s> it has the name on the box and it says avivo and a few other things </s>
<s> it s pci express ati official brand if that helps </s>
<s> shows avivo is some nice marketing fluff </s>
<s> you might be able to just connect your video out from the ps2 to the video in run up the supplied software to see if this works </s>
<s> sorry but with specific model numbers even better a link to the card i can only write generalities </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> and a dozen other sites and i can t find video in </s>
<s> i see a s video output </s>
<s> do you have the product </s>
<s> you may have something better than what they offer </s>
