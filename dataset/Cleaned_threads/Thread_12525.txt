<s> hello i am running a computer with windows 7 service pack 1 64 bit os and i m trying to install a wireless canon mx420 printer </s>
<s> my computer is connected to my router through an ethernet cord and i have managed to set up my printer s wifi just fine </s>
<s> it appears connected on the printer s screen and i have disabled all firewalls on my computer yet it still won t detect it please any help and insight would be appreciated </s>
<s> have you installed the printer s software onto the win 7 computer </s>
<s> as i understand it you have to quot add a network wireless or bluetooth printer quot to win 7 using the wizard in the start gt quot devices and printers quot folder so you may have to do that as well </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> i have done that yes after more research i am concerned that my computer may simply not have a wireless adapter enabled but i can t figure out how to check that </s>
<s> when i go to networking options i select the network adapter options and only find my ethernet </s>
<s> this is odd because i have had a printer wirelessly print and scan before </s>
<s> what are you using for a router </s>
<s> just off the top i would suspect router issue s </s>
<s> i use a motorola surfboard from midco less than a year old </s>
<s> or have wifi </s>
<s> since there are more models i can t guess which you have </s>
<s> and i do have the canon mx870 working great here </s>

<s> you said in your first post that your win7 computer is connected to your router via an ethernet card </s>
<s> if so it does not need a wireless adapter and that should not affect it seeing and connecting to the printer </s>
<s> while i bow to the change discussion about the router and i accept there may be some setting or other there that needs looking at i m still puzzled what the computer s wizard said when you used it to connect to this printer </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> the router has wifi i use it around the house with my laptop and my nook without a problem </s>
<s> when i try to connect the printer either by local port compname printername or by the ip address that the printer lists that it occupies while connected to the wifi it keeps saying error port does not exist or it tries to detect until it times out </s>
<s> i tried today to unplug my ethernet cord from the pc and try to create a wireless connection and see if that s the problem and i don t even see my network s name or any of my neighbors for that matter on the wireless connections my pc is seeing </s>
<s> i m thinking that s where the problem lies but not sure how to proceed from here </s>
<s> in that case i have to pass </s>
<s> i was under the impression the printer connection to the router was fine quot i have managed to set up my printer s wifi just fine </s>
<s> it appears connected on the printer s screen quot </s>
<s> may be bob s observation is right </s>
<s> his surfboard didn t have wifi </s>
<s> he asked if you had a different model </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> the printer s connection to the router is fine </s>
<s> as i mentioned above the printer is connected my nook is connected my laptop is connected </s>
<s> there no reason to think the wifi doesn t work it does </s>
<s> the problem is on the pc s side </s>
