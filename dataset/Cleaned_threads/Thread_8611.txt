<s> ok so today i was messing around with my iphone and i was trying to move all my third party apps to private var applications through terminal and i entered the commands that i read online and i must have done something wrong because it deleted all my apps </s>
<s> every single one of them </s>
<s> now i have an iphone with a blank home screen </s>
<s> i can see the dock but no applications </s>
<s> then i tried to restore by putting my iphone in restore mode and it stopped in the middle giving me error 2001 and i know have an iphone with absolutely nothing on it the restore deleted all the other files in recovery mode </s>
<s> upon trying to exit recovery mode using iliberty it failed </s>
<s> there is only one way to fix this </s>
<s> i am asking for a huge favor i guess but does someone have a complete backup of a freshly restored iphones at default settngs </s>
<s> probably about 120mb that i can download and drag onto my iphone to at least havethe files on there i would put them on using the file manager in ifuntastic which still is working any help would be great </s>

<s> don t think you will have much success here with sorting this one out </s>
<s> worth a try though </s>
<s> have you thought of asking apple </s>
<s> that phone must still be under warranty </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> hacking iphones does void warranty </s>
<s> i ve seen the signs at the genius bar too many times but recently i think my local store moved theirs on a shelf behind the main desks there </s>
<s> anyway sounds like the original poster bricked the iphone in some way </s>
<s> my thoughts for regular non hacked iphones ipods itunes can make a backup of preferences settings etc should you allow that feature but with hacked devices i do not know </s>
<s> of course if the phone is stuck in some sort of recovery mode problem that does not do any good as i believe a recovery is needed before itunes can prompt you with a quot restore to latest backup quot message </s>
<s> to the original poster see if re downloading installing the 1 1 4 firmware works </s>
<s> google for it and i m sure you ll find it </s>
<s> if you can use whatever program you used original to load it on there this could work having no real experience with this i am merely guessing from what i ve heard though </s>
<s> i m waiting for firmware 2 0 to get apps </s>
<s> bmf </s>
