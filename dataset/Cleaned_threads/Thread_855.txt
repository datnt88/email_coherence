<s> i downloaded cpuz and it says i have bus speed of 333 31 it also says that i have a fsb of 1333 31 what is fsb </s>
<s> when i had this machine built they told me i had a front bus of 1320 is this the same thing </s>
<s> is likely going to do nothing but create more questions </s>
<s> can you reveal why you are looking at these numbers versus performing a benchmark to compare your system </s>
<s> or better yet use your pc </s>

<s> here is the rest </s>

<s> does not fit in this small space </s>
<s> i see you added a lot of details but what i see is the usual run of the mill quad core pc </s>
<s> these can play games with a good video card but the usual issue is the power supply </s>
<s> did you make sure it will support your card </s>
<s> and no software will check or report this for you </s>
<s> the list looks like one of those hp or dell machines </s>
<s> if it is why didn t you write quot i have a hp d4999t quot </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the machine was custom built about 6 years ago </s>
<s> it has a 500 watt power supply and my aaaaaaapc 1500 tells me it is only drawing 90 watts </s>
<s> what does fsb stand for in cpu z </s>
<s> same mb </s>
<s> maybe he ll give up the psu info otherwise it could an be a tough road ahead for the new gpu </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> then we run the risk of overtaxing a rail </s>
<s> look at the stick on the side and get the specs and the age since psus degrade over time </s>
<s> i try to keep at 50 of any rail as well as the total </s>
<s> thanks for the apc watt reading </s>
<s> you re going to do well </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i think proffett is messing with you </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> it looks like the 333 is probabally frequency and maybe the 1333 is the chip set </s>
<s> i really don t know </s>
<s> i don t have the latest version of cpuz but mine dose not show front side bus so i am just wild guessing </s>
<s> good luck </s>
