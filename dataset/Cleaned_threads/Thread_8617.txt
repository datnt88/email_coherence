<s> my gateway notebook broke last week and my dad was able to load the hard drive into a usb 2 0 hard disk </s>
<s> i never uploaded these to a seperate computer and last night my dad accidentally erased everything </s>
<s> he was able to recover my files from 6 months ago and everything before them from 2001 until 2 2006 but all the files from the past 6 months are gone </s>
<s> is there any way to recover these </s>
<s> and i ve tried the winundelete and a bunch of other programs but none of these have recovered the deleted files </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i suggest you try recover my files from </s>
<s> if you run a complete file search of the quot physical drive quot you will be searching all the data on the drive </s>
<s> you can search for specific file types and hopefully get your data back </s>
<s> it works well </s>
<s> my mother in law s disk showed no data looked like a clean format no idea what happened before i got it was able to search and recover in her case word documents jpegs and all the oe mailboxes dbx even after a full format data is never really gone until you write new data over the old stuff </s>
<s> there are data recover services google them you send them your drive they recover what they can and send it back usally in cd or dvd discs but they are expensive </s>
<s> i had a 40gb hard drive that simply would not spin i was told a lighting storm must have fried the disk s circuit board </s>
<s> i called and e mailed a few places cost would range from 700 1600 </s>
<s> i m sure the data was on theat disk it s just a matter of how badly you need it </s>
<s> the good news is that most places will not charge you if they can t recover anything </s>
<s> for me monthly backups of critical data are a must i can live rolled back one month worst case scenario </s>
<s> if everything of value is kept on one disk remember it s not a question of if but simply when good luck </s>
<s> wayne </s>
