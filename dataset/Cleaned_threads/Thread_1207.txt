<s> we just bought a camcorder with it s own hd </s>
<s> i want to be able to put family videos and pictures from the camcorder and some that are stored on our laptops too </s>
<s> i see manufacturers like iomega has portable hard drives </s>
<s> any replys would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> reading the posts here i can safely bet that external drives are not the best solution </s>
<s> any chance of you bringing yourself to put what you can t lose on a few dvds </s>
<s> ok dvd s are the safest then </s>
<s> just wanted to make sure </s>
<s> i ve been a quot member quot of cnet sense the website started and have read the same </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
