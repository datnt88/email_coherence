<s> my tdk 880n internal dvd burner has been acting flaky gets hung up alot when i try to access it or try to read data off a disc </s>
<s> are there any tools commonly available that i could use to test the drive before i take it out and replace it </s>
<s> tia ss </s>
<s> i can clean install linux in under an hour and see what k3b thinks of it </s>
<s> however this is reserved for personal works since tech time per hour is more expensive than a new drive </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> do a quot backup quot of enough files to fill the dvd and quot restore quot to a new directory lt dvdtest gt </s>
<s> if there are problems with any of this trash the writer and get a new one </s>
<s> bob is right it would cost you more for bench service than a good dual layer dvd writer </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
