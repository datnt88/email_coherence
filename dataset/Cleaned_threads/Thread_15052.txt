<s> i have a samsung 24 quot widescreen monitor and i know the native resolution is 1920x1080 </s>
<s> i also am aware that this equates to a 16x9 </s>
<s> i want to change the resolution because i cant see 1920x1080 that well </s>
<s> out of all the optional resolutions the only other one that equates to a 16x9 is 1360x768 </s>
<s> when i change the display to that resolution everything on the screen gets fuzzy </s>
<s> it doesn t happen with any other resolution </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> no resolution other than native will provide the optimum image </s>
<s> there are some tweaks in windows that might help </s>
<s> make sure you use quot clear type quot for text </s>
<s> you can change icon size on your desktop windows xp and 7 both have features to help those with vision problems </s>
<s> in 7 it s called quot ease of access quot or some such an accessory </s>
<s> what about upgrading your video </s>
<s> perhaps you already have if not that might be a thought </s>
<s> an aftermarket slot card could would increase your options </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i tried the clear type option but it didn t help </s>
<s> its not just the type but everything on the screen looks off </s>
<s> why does it happen only with this one resolution </s>
<s> steve s post mentioned native resolution which would be optimal for that monitor but not necessarily for the onboard computer hardware that is why i asked if you had upgraded your system specifically an aftermarket video card that could give you more options and potentially better performance </s>
