<s> looking to upgrade my emachine t5026 </s>
<s> putting in a gigabyte ga ma69gm s2h and amd64 x2 6000 cpu 2gb ddr2 800 ram </s>
<s> the power supply that comes with the t5026 i believe is 300w is this enough to power my new system or do i need to go 500w </s>
<s> thanks in advance also i m using integrated graphics may use pcie slot in the future </s>
<s> if you re not going to add to the system other than mtrbd </s>
<s> replacement then the original psu will do fine </s>
<s> at least you know if problems crop up then upgrade the psu </s>
<s> if you plan to really stuff the system then add it then during the mtrbd </s>
<s> install if for anything the system is open to do so </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i d look at a new power supply just to be safe and given that that x2 is probably leaps and bounds above whatever its replacing in power consumption and performance </s>
<s> i d also look for a high quality psu over sheer wattage ratings i can t stress this enough and if you do decide to skimp on it anyways all we can do is look on and say quot told ya so quot a few manufacturers to add to that list corsair memory rebadged seasonic parts ocz technology very reputable manufacturer </s>
