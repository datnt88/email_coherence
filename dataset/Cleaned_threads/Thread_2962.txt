<s> i have spoken with you all a few times before about the same computer i ve been trying to fix it since before the summer </s>
<s> i just got a new processor the ram works tested it mom s computer and the motherboard is new though i suppose it could have been doa </s>
<s> technically the processor could be doa too but i really hope not because i want a working computer that s not my mom s </s>
<s> hah whenever i turn it on the fans go but my monitor light remains orange inactive </s>
<s> i noticed something though when using another monitor instead of remaining orange it flashes between orange and green when the computer is turned on when off the light is orange </s>
<s> computer on or off the viewsonic e70 my usual monitor shows orange computer off the compaq p50 shows orange on it flashes orange green </s>
<s> that tells me that the monitor is getting some sort of signal stating the computer has turned on but isn t sending signal properly </s>
<s> another note the motherboard i have has onboard video and i have a pci express x16 nvidia graphics card </s>
<s> i ve tried with the onboard video as well as plugging in the video card and using that </s>
<s> same results for both </s>
<s> did i receive a bad motherboard </s>
<s> what s newegg s policy on returning motherboards </s>
<s> gosh this is frustrating thanks in advance for the help </s>
<s> let s repeat a few common mistakes and a troubleshooting method i use with great success </s>
<s> 1 the motherboard mounting </s>
<s> a high percentage of new dead pc builds find an extra mounting stud on the backside of the motherboard </s>
<s> this in the best scenario just causes the machine to do nothing </s>
<s> at worst it fries the board </s>
<s> 2 the jumpers and cables </s>
<s> it s no fault of the home builder but occasionally you ll find an error on the documentation </s>
<s> i was burnt on this so i always try it with all ide and other cables cards unplugged so see if it s something simple </s>
<s> 3 finally the 4 item test </s>
<s> place the psu motherboard speaker and the cpu with it s hsf on a piece of cardboard </s>
<s> no other parts </s>
<s> power up and it should beep in protest </s>
<s> this is the beep test </s>
<s> if it fails then you are looking at the 1 to 4 bad parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> odd i never got a reply notification </s>
<s> anyway the motherboard is sitting on its static bag on my desk </s>
<s> so no shorting on the back of it </s>
<s> the only things present power supply motherboard cpu heatsink fan ram monitor no beeping though the board does have an onboard speaker </s>
<s> any more suggestions </s>
<s> as in ram is installed we don t know if it s that </s>
<s> bottom line </s>
<s> too many parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry i missed that note </s>
<s> i removed the ram turned on the computer fan spun no video no beeping </s>
<s> if there is a video card ide cables reset buttons etc </s>
<s> those go too </s>
<s> when we get to the bottom 4 parts then we know we are looking at the 4 possible bad or badly configured parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had the monitor hooked up but just now i tried again without monitor and no beeping </s>
<s> to re affirm your question the only things on the table are power supply motherboard on top of static bag cpu heatsink fan </s>
<s> out of curiosity how much voltage does the speaker need </s>
<s> i could potentially put some voltage straight to it to test it so you know there are nothing on the power reset etc jumper pins i am turning the computer on using a piece of metal across the two power pins </s>
<s> while you need to check your work cmos clear jumpers and such there is some that run into this dead system where the cpu and motherboard are good but doesn t boot </s>
<s> i made that mistake last week with a new socket 775 system </s>
<s> in the end i had to hit the maker s web site and my 775 dual core cpu wasn t on the list </s>
<s> details are missing so no one but you can check this out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the jumpers are factory though i ll check them and i ll check the site for my cpu compatibility i ll let ya know later for now </s>
<s> i checked the board and it seems the only things in the way of jumpers are something called wp_en and the cmos clear </s>
<s> they are both disabled </s>
<s> i haven t been able to check cpu compatibility yet though i should mention that newegg did say it s compatible back when i bought it </s>
<s> i see you have more work to do </s>
<s> it sometimes takes a few tries for people to get there </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t understand more parts </s>
<s> if you re asking what s hooked up i ve already told you power supply motherboard cpu heatsink fan what more work to do </s>
<s> anyway i ll let you know about the cpu </s>
<s> is this still in the case </s>
<s> when i have a dead pc i strip it down to 4 and only 4 parts </s>
<s> this way i know it s just those 4 parts </s>
<s> no case no ram etc bob </s>
<s> about a week ago re troubleshooting by ck87 jf 10 14 07 7 06 am in reply to not a failure but a dead pc you built </s>
<s> by r proffitt moderator anyway the motherboard is sitting on its static bag on my desk </s>
<s> so no shorting on the back of it </s>
<s> so there is no case </s>
<s> no beep means it s dead part s incompatible parts or we have something horribly wrong </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> aside from trying to find a friend with an amd 939 what are my other options to figure out what s dead </s>
<s> i called best buy and circuit city and for them to diagnose the problem they both want 50 </s>
<s> here i have a voltmeter spare psu speaker so i can get such systems down to motherboard and or cpu </s>
<s> but current technology only gets us to those parts </s>
<s> i also use the voltmeter to read the cmos battery since if it s too low you will find some boards being held in reset </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> like you a multimeter spare psu and i have another speaker on that diagnostics card which tells me the system is okay debug code reads quot ffffff quot </s>
<s> when i get home i ll test the battery </s>
<s> my motherboard s page on newegg it says quot athlon 64 x2 athlon 64 fx athlon 64 quot for the cpu specs i have an athlon 64 x2 i could be wrong but i believe this is the cpu i got i ll get my mom to check her purchase history when i can </s>
<s> amd athlon 64 x2 4200 toledo 2 2ghz </s>
