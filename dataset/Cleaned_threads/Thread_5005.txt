<s> well i had already ordered my asus g50v a1 laptop and i was looking at the specs on the computer and i noticed that the letters at the end of graphics cards were different gs gtx gt and i did some research and discovered that there are different versions of the nvidia 9800 and some are better than others </s>
<s> my laptop i had ordered had an 9800 gs which some have told me isnt the best </s>
<s> i have watched some youtube videos of people playing crysis with my same computer but they had an 9700 gt not a 9800 gs in it </s>
<s> is the 9800 gs better than the 9700 gt and will i be able to play high quality games like crysis </s>
<s> the 9800gs should be a smidgen faster that the 9700gt </s>
<s> ok thanks im not to worried anyway i wont even be playing crisis on it </s>
<s> im probably going to be playing counter strike kotor diable ext </s>
<s> on it nothing like far cry 2 and cryisis </s>
