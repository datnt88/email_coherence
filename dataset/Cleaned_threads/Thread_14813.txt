<s> hi i live in an old house and i do not know how current the wiring is </s>
<s> the outlets are all three prong grounded </s>
<s> what i would appreciate knowing is what should can i do to protect my computer </s>
<s> i am already using a dynex battery backup uninterupted power supply </s>
<s> the outlets on the ups that i am plugged into are marked quot surge battery quot there are three additional ones for quot surge quot only </s>
<s> will this setup be sufficient or do i need something else </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> your setup is the most basic for your needs </s>
<s> i suggest you get at least a singular ac plug type surge protector for that ups to plug into for yet another simple level of protection </s>
<s> the dynex brand is a cheapie so don t expect miracles other than simple protection </s>
<s> you can also have an ac line conditioner to better squelch ac irregualrites on top of the ups </s>
<s> if you like and can afford to have a electrician check the line and if possible place a elect </s>
<s> box circuital surge bkr </s>
<s> for that computer line that room </s>
<s> further that the ac line is truly grounded as older homes can be iffy </s>
<s> visit the tripplet and apc websites for details on wants needs of systm protection </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks willy i will checkout the websites that you suggested and i am glad to know that my setup is basic and how to improve it </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> i wouldn t assume it s actual 3 prong wired and have someone check into it </s>
<s> what some did was take an old wiring system and throw 3 prong outlets in which lack the ground </s>
<s> best way to tell is if you take an outlet cover off and check for the black white and copper ground </s>
<s> in some old mobile homes they used aluminum for the ground and black white and came loose eventually </s>
<s> of course there are cases where parts of a home have newer wiring and other parts still have the old stuff </s>
<s> as well there are cases where the ground isn t grounded and just runs through the walls into oblivion </s>
<s> if you want to be sure have a licensed electrician look at it wiring in a home should be quot one quot of the first priorities and taken seriously </s>
<s> then at least you know what you have </s>
<s> some electricians do a cheap or free inspection depending on where you live </s>
<s> paul </s>
<s> go to home depot or lowes and buy a three prong ground checker </s>
<s> it is a bit more than five bucks if i remember correctly </s>
<s> use it on every outlet in your house to be safe </s>
<s> the lights are explained on the device </s>
<s> it assures you that there is ground and the wires are correctly connected </s>
<s> it is also useful for insuring that an outlet has really been turned off if you need to make a repair like fixing a broken outlet </s>
<s> for switches you need to use the lamp to tell you power is off for fixing a switch </s>
<s> if you are not sure of your skills do not attempt repairs get skilled help </s>
<s> do you have a breaker box or fuses </s>
<s> are all circuits labeled </s>
<s> it is worth making a list of what outlets and or lights are on every circuit </s>
<s> duke </s>
<s> use an outlet checker as mentioned in another post to check for a proper ground </s>
<s> this is for safety </s>
<s> a bad ground won t bother the computer at all </s>
<s> a battery backup is overkill for simple protection </s>
<s> it s main purpose is to protect against a power outage </s>
<s> most batery backups as far as i know don t isolate the computer from the power line </s>
<s> they switch to an isolated supply the battery when the outlet loses power </s>
<s> otherwise power from the outlet goes through a filter then to your computer just like a surge protected power strip </s>
<s> quot surge quot and quot glitch quot are misnomers </s>
<s> what you really need to wory about are lightening strikes sending very high voltage spikes into your house s wiring </s>
<s> most spikes are brief and low amplitude and don t get through the computer s power supply </s>
<s> a lightning strike however can punch through the insulation of the power supply and then into the electronics </s>
<s> a surge protector shorts out this high voltage before it gets to your computer </s>
<s> for most people a 15 surge protected power strip is all you need </s>
<s> it s all i have and i ve never had any problems with a power spike since the early 80s when an unprotected modem was destroyed by a lightning storm </s>
