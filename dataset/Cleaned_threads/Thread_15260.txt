<s> i am writing about my mother s computer </s>
<s> i don t know the specific model number but i know it s an hp pavilion desktop </s>
<s> she has the in home warranty with best buy the geek squad </s>
<s> well her internet went out and the geek squad determined that her network card is bad and needs to be replaced </s>
<s> of course they ordered the wrong part and he s coming back this saturday to replace the network card </s>
<s> my mom asked if there was any way to access the internet in the mean time and he told her to purchase a usb wireless adapter for that purpose </s>
<s> well she purchased one i attempted to install it but we are not having any luck </s>
<s> my question is is it possible for this usb wireless adapter to create an internet connection if her network card is not working properly </s>
<s> i m under the impression that this adapter is to connect a computer to an already existing wireless network not to create an internet connection on one computer where no internet connection is available </s>
<s> i m very confused </s>
<s> we are only talking about one computer there is no network no laptop no other desktop etc </s>
<s> we have a linksys router that we used years ago to set up a network when i had a laptop and still lived at home </s>
<s> they have a new computer now and the router is not hooked up </s>
<s> is there any way the router can be used to access the internet </s>
<s> can someone please help me understand </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you had a cable dls modem and connected a wireless capable router to it the usb wireless adapter would be of use to you </s>
<s> she has a cable modem and i have it hooked to the wireless capable linksys router but the router is not picking anything up thus the adapter is not either </s>
<s> i don t understand how the two can create an internet connection </s>
<s> on the router everything is lighting up that should except the quot internet quot part </s>
<s> well that s obviously because she has no internet connection due to a bad network card </s>
<s> the adapter installed just like the book said it should but it s still not creating an internet connection like we were told it would </s>
<s> am i overthinking this thing or what </s>
<s> the wireless feature may be disabled on the router </s>
<s> you will need to login to the router s admin page and look over the settings </s>
<s> visit the networking and wireless forum to read the forum sticky </s>
<s> it s the one at the top </s>
<s> set up your router according to its instructions </s>
