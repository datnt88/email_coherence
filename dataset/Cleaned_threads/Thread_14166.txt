<s> reinstalled xp and it doesn t detect the onboard vga compatible video </s>
<s> i know have 640x480 and color quality is 4bit </s>
<s> woohooo </s>
<s> in device manager as quot other device quot with yellow question mark </s>
<s> it s a legend computer gt nothing on their website </s>
<s> winbond motherboard gt no luck here either </s>
<s> at this point i d be happy with any driver that would work </s>
<s> m vga compatible driver </s>
<s> shouldn t be this hard to find </s>
<s> anyone know of a driver that is most likely to work </s>
<s> a quot m vga compatible driver quot </s>
<s> thanks g </s>
<s> there were several video drivers listed under quot winbond quot </s>
<s> you didn t give your model number or any other identifiers so hard to say if yours is there also i did find downloads on the winbond site once i switched it to english </s>
<s> but it was not clear to me of these were what you were looking for hope this helps good hunting </s>
<s> sounds like you need the via hyperon 4n1 driver for the mother board then the video driver </s>
