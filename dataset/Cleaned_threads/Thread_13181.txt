<s> i have creative 5200 5 1 speakers connected to a creative audigy 1 sound card </s>
<s> i m running windows xp pro and use windows media player </s>
<s> i ve noticed that my subwoofer doesn t sound so good when playing some hip hop mp3s </s>
<s> so i tried unplugging the center lfe connector and i noticed that my subwoofer was still working </s>
<s> i unplugged the rear speakers connection and still the subwoofer was working </s>
<s> i realized that i get subwoofer sounds from each connector each connector would make the subwoofer more powerful </s>
<s> the speakers sound fine though </s>
<s> so my question is if this is normal or could there be something wrong </s>
<s> could someone please confirm if the subwoofer is supposed to react to all three connections or just the center lfe connector </s>
<s> most mp3s are stereo and will be 2 0 stereo or 2 1 adds bass center </s>
<s> capable </s>
<s> owners of 5 1 systems will have complaints like yours </s>
<s> there is no easy fix here since even a audiocd may not sound as good as real 5 1 content </s>

<s> that makes sense never thought about the state of mp3s </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i guess the only way to make mp3s sound better is if i had a player capable of up converting 2 0 sound into 5 1 sound but even that s not guaranteed to fix the problem </s>
<s> while it didn t enable 5 1 output it seems to sound better at times </s>
<s> your ears may want to try it out </s>

<s> i don t mean to be picky but is there such a plugin for windows media player </s>
<s> i don t use windows media player </s>
<s> various reasons </s>
