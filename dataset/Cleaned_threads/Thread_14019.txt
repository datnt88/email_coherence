<s> i can t pick between the d link di 624 and the linksys wrt54gs for my wireless router laptop magizine rates the d link as the top performer out of the wireless routers they tested however i have my wired network on linksys parts and have liked their service and support question is would it be better to go with d link on its performance rating then hook up the computers with matching d link or other company adpaters or go with linksys and matching linksys adpaters making the network on all one company s product hoping to gain performance this way </s>
<s> thanks for the advice </s>
<s> that usually pays off if you use some quot plus quot feature offered by one or the other maker </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> support from the manufacturer is much easier when dealing solely with their product </s>
<s> the only issue i have found in mixing d link and linksys is in having to change the default ip address used d link likes to use 192 168 0 1 while linksys uses 192 168 1 1 </s>
