<s> please advise the height in cm </s>
<s> or inches of the following half height drive slim drive which of these is standard </s>
<s> i am trying to find a dvd recorder for a dell 4500s </s>
<s> the height in this is about 1 1 8 inches outside the box measurement </s>
<s> thanks for any and all help gordon </s>
<s> my advice is to get it from dell but my better advice is to go external </s>
<s> the fastest speed i see today on internals is 2x </s>
<s> this means that a full dvd recording session will be on the order of about 40 minutes </s>
<s> if you get an external 8x drive it could cost much less and bring that time down to under 20 minutes </s>
<s> in fact my external usb 2 0 and fireware case was 35 dollars </s>
<s> the 8x i picked up was 99 bucks on sale and it s been great </s>

<s> bob thanks for your response </s>
<s> i tried 2 e mails to dell sales and got nothing thus my use of the storage forum i have 6 usb ports on my dell dim </s>
<s> 4500s and all are used </s>
<s> i know i can purchase a usb hub that will add many more ports </s>
<s> but i have been told that the more usb devices that are added the slower the computer will be </s>
<s> i am trying to use an internal drive that dell calls quot slim quot </s>
<s> the height may be 12 7 mm </s>
<s> as you suggest i may just go with an extenal drive </s>
<s> again thanks gordon </s>
<s> emails are often just cleaned off by the spam filters </s>
<s> for me it s an 800 number </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ve never read or heard of such </s>
<s> there is an issue that is not a big deal is that your usb hub must share the bandwidth but if i add a pc card usb 2 0 then i see full speed from those ports as fast as pc card can go </s>
<s> and the usb 2 0 hub is a good idea since i use one like a dock </s>
<s> makes for fast getaways </s>
