<s> i have a wd1200jb c drive and a 40gig d problem is local properties shows only 40g in the c so i can t access the balance although the proper recognition is shown in quot hardware quot is there a fix </s>
<s> to me it appears you want to run the disk management tool in windows xp and use that space for another drive by making the remainder space a partition and formatting that new space </s>
<s> unless you think there is a hardware issue here i d just prepare the unused space and start using it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> look under disk management and see if you see unallocated space on drive 0 the fix you could create a new partition in the unallocated space wipe drive 0 and start all over creating the partitions or buy a product like partition magic or disk director which would allow you to expand drive c to the full capacity </s>
<s> the options are endless these are the probably the most common </s>
<s> should you choose using pm or dd you should backup your data to minimize the risk of data loss </s>
