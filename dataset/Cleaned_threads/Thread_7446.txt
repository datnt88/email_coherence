<s> i am looking at buying a tablet for my 8 year old and 4 yr old to play games and possibly watch a movie on </s>
<s> i would like to keep them under 100 </s>
<s> what are the best ones for the money </s>
<s> somehow it looks like a phone to me </s>
<s> but you can t phone with it </s>
<s> and you ll have to find the games in the android market </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> and geeks com you see sub 99 buck 7 inch tablets </s>
<s> be sure to ask if the games run on such things </s>
<s> i d think about the kindle fire if it must be for games and movies without a need to futz with it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> remember that axiom </s>
<s> i ve seen plenty of quot cheap quot tablets advertised in drugstore circulars and if you look at reviews by people who bought them they d be dead upon getting or within 6 months </s>
<s> save your pennies and get a name brand product with trusted support </s>
<s> apple ipod touch or amazon fire for 200 are best choices now </s>
<s> i would also recommend the amazon kindle fire at 199 99 </s>
<s> i have several tablets myself and also purchased the kindle fire </s>
<s> i bought the fire for my 4 year old niece to use </s>
<s> there are many cheaper tablets available however i think a lot of them have more resistive type screens which means one has to really press harder on the screen which makes things more difficult for kids </s>
<s> they also tend to have much slower processors are slow to respond and many don t have access to the entire android app store </s>
<s> kindle fire doesn t have the android app store either but amazon has their own app store with tons of apps and many apps for kids </s>
<s> there is also a way to install the android app store on the fire </s>
<s> in the past i had a nextbook and there wasn t a good app selection </s>
<s> i also have the hp touchpad which i got when they had their fire sale </s>
<s> first i thought it would have been great for my niece but their selection of apps is quite low </s>
<s> there aren t many kids apps and i have found what there is either doesn t work at all or they are junk </s>
<s> i think the ipad probably has the most available apps for kids and i ve seen many great kids apps that arent available for android but android certainly is catching up but the ipad is quite expensive </s>
<s> i have already found at least 10 games some of them educational for my niece that she absolutely loves on the kindle fire </s>
<s> it s a 7 quot tablet so it s easier for her to hold than a 10 quot tablet </s>
<s> one thing i ve been reading about lately though is that since amazon has it s store attached it s very very easy to make purchases on it </s>
<s> as of right now i don t think there s a way to block it </s>
<s> so a child could easily buy apps and other things with just one click </s>
<s> i m not worried about this with my niece just yet but i will be checking to see if i can turn off their 1 click purchasing </s>
<s> other than this i think the fire is a great option </s>
<s> i think the barnes amp nobles nook tablet is another great option </s>
<s> i don t have one and i m not sure how large their app selection is </s>
<s> both the kindle fire and nook have tons of children s books availble many of which a child can interact with which is pretty neat for them </s>
<s> i think acer might make a 7 quot tablet for around 200 as well and that would have the entire android app store available on it </s>
