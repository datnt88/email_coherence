<s> i currently have a wireless network with a cable modem </s>
<s> i am thinking of switching to dsl because it is cheaper </s>
<s> do i need to have one computer on at all times for the dsl network to work </s>
<s> i can t find a direct answer to this question </s>
<s> all i want is to be able to have my wireless network on like it is now so that any computer and the tivo in our house can connect at anytime </s>
<s> is it possible to do this with a dsl connection </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> but most likely you need to change or reconfigure the ip address so before you change the modem please make a note on your current configuration </s>
<s> so everything will work the same with my network </s>
<s> the only difference is that instead of haveing a modem that gets a signal from my cable line i will have a modem that gets a signal from my phone line right </s>
<s> i wont have to worry about having a computer establish some sort of connection so that the rest of the computers can get online right </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> is simple add a wireless router to the modem and each individual device may connect independently </s>
<s> note that some modem s will have built in routing capabilities </s>
<s> ask you isp if they are providing such </s>
<s> you pretty much called it </s>
<s> there is no difference between dsl and cable other than the physical connection </s>
<s> swap the modem and plug your router back in </s>
