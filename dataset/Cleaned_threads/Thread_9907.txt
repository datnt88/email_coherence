<s> hello guys i have a question </s>
<s> i m currently buying a new pc and i would like to know which of the two options gives me more performance </s>
<s> a single 750gb 7200 rpm speed sata 3gb s hard drive or two 320gb 7200 rpm speed sata hard drives in raid 0 there is no specification for the 320gb drive so i m assuming its 1 5gb s </s>
<s> which of the two options will give me a better performance </s>
<s> or will there be barely any difference </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> that sata speed is just for the interface and not indicative of any drive speed </s>
<s> in fact a 3 0g drive benchmarked not much faster when we jumpered it down to 1 5 or connected it to a 1 5g interface </s>
<s> test then decide </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks a lot for your quick reply </s>
<s> guess i ll have to test it then </s>
