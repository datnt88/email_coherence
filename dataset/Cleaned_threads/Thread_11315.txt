<s> i m shopping for an online backup service for my mac </s>
<s> i m currently trying carbonite but i m reading good things about crashplan also </s>
<s> any recommendations </s>
<s> i ll be backing up around 50 gb of data and once the initial upload is done the incremental backups will be pretty small </s>
<s> i have cable internet with pretty good upload speeds </s>
<s> this discussion from a while back </s>
<s> i ditched carbonite for crashplan last night and so far it s a big improvement </s>
<s> in 14 hours crashplan has already uploaded more data than carbonite did in twice the time </s>
<s> i ll keep researching though especially in terms of the security of my data </s>
