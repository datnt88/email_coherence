<s> i got a used desktop and have a number of upgrades i would like to make to it </s>
<s> but first i have to get it running </s>
<s> when you push the power button the power button comes on but the hard drives are not spinning and the display does not change not even to show the bios </s>
<s> i think this may be either the motherboard or the graphics card </s>
<s> does anybody know which </s>
<s> sorry but you gave no clue of the system details and all that </s>
<s> its best to provide as much as possible otherwise expect more questions just to get at a starting point </s>
<s> remove all connections to drives </s>
<s> now power on what are the results </s>
<s> is there now a display of any system respose not the display s own lost signal message or similar </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i didn t think the specs would be relevant so could you tell me what you need </s>
<s> i tried the hard drive thing before i posted this </s>
<s> but there is no bios </s>
<s> specs ms xp home computer is a gateway it says the model no </s>
<s> is atxaeg graphics card is a nvidia 8860 let me know what else you need </s>
<s> since you think the specs are irrelevant then the answers may be irrelevant to this machine </s>
<s> to save volunteers from asking this question and having a post 20 entries long before we can get down to work why not help others help you </s>
<s> remember these are member to member forums no paid staff so make it easy </s>
<s> thing of the person who wants to help you change your flat tire </s>
<s> they ask you to point to where the flat is and you tell them it s not important </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t think that is an accurate analogy </s>
<s> i don t need to know how to fix it </s>
<s> i was just asking for a second opinion of what was broken </s>
<s> there is no need to chew my head off for being mistaken </s>
<s> i wanted to share that these forums are all volunteer all member to member </s>
<s> which means you get to try a little harder </s>
<s> no paid staff also means that a few members get upset over quot tech support quot i apologize for my analogy but i have many more to choose from </s>
<s> but let s get back to your discussion </s>
<s> all that i wanted to share i have now it s time for you to decide if it s worth helping others help you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but let s cover a common no boot spins drives issue </s>
<s> many forget about that little battery on the motherboard </s>
<s> some motherboards will not boot when that the battery voltage is too low </s>
<s> this is why details matter </s>
<s> i can t tell if this machine is known to have that issue </s>
<s> make it easy on others with machine details otherwise you get guesses and maybe bad ones </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m not looking for free tech support </s>
<s> you seem to think this is the first time i ve looked at a computer </s>
<s> the make of my motherboard is an intel desktop board d850mv </s>
<s> but when we want to talk about a machine it s best to know what it is </s>
<s> leading off with the above can send folk away from helping out with ideas </s>
<s> while you seem to want to debate this why not go with the forum flow </s>
<s> just put in the details so others won t run away </s>
<s> gives a second idea </s>
<s> this board may also exhibit this issue with a not so good power supply or that adapter intel writes about </s>
<s> details are needed a volt meter on that battery is a good idea </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the light on the motherboard is green so i don t think it is the power supply </s>
<s> voltage test got the promised three volts </s>
<s> gives us more about what or why the psu can cause a failed boot </s>
<s> let s say you want to troubleshoot a dead pc </s>
<s> the tried and true method is to remove all but the psu motherboard cpu hsf and the speaker </s>
<s> if those parts are good then the speaker sounds in protest of all the missing other parts </s>
<s> if not we are staring at the last 4 possible parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i posted to remove all connections to all drives </s>
<s> this way it releases the power burden for that and if those devices actually hold back the boot in h w manner </s>
<s> plus if the display changes it gives a clue </s>
<s> since you have a gateway system which is oem but no model </s>
<s> the model is on a decal or sticker somewhere on the system along side the serial </s>
<s> i don t recall a atxeag model sorry </s>
<s> certain models may have proprietary psus or give a clue to the age of the system </s>
<s> in no uncertain terms it maybe too old unique to find replacements or deal with as costs may factor in </s>
<s> regardless that is very important to me to ask as now i know to search for specs and such at support websites </s>
<s> upon visiting the gateway support website enter the serial should give clue to day1 when it was build what it consisted of </s>
<s> in most cases where a system won t power on then simply replace psu with a similar or greater wattage unit </s>
<s> if it still doesn t work then deal with the mtrbd at this time reduce the system to bare minimum to help progress </s>
<s> an old system as robert stated replace the bios battery as they don t last forever </s>
<s> also the led that s on the mtrbd </s>
<s> is not a real clue solver other than to say yeah there s some power but a psu supplies various voltages and amps etc </s>
<s> if one fails it all fails </s>
<s> sorry if seemly i ask dumb questions but from my prospective there are no dumb question when getting to the nitty gritty </s>
<s> i did a quick google of atxaeg and found some users don t know the support website has any info </s>
<s> which makes me think this maybe a foreign model or somehow unique system </s>
<s> further the atxeag also may have additional numbers to narrow down the system model </s>
<s> ie ie btw if the mtrbd </s>
<s> is at fault then do you want to even try to fix it </s>
<s> far too often replacing the mtrbd </s>
<s> is best due to cost and or time involvement fyi </s>
<s> i hope this all helps come back with results </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
