<s> hey hey lt div gt i just want to get quick advise </s>
<s> i have an old computer with the following lt div gt gigabyte ga p35 ds3 something like that 2 6 ghz core 2 duo intel xfx geforce 8800 gts 2gb memory lt div gt to me it looks like the video card is the slowest part so i thought i could replace the video card by maybe a gtx 260 or a gtx 460 or something like that </s>
<s> what do you think </s>
<s> ah my goal is to have a few more fps in games and i don t want to spend the money on a complete new computer </s>
<s> thanks already tobi lt div gt </s>
<s> video cards were asked about and the last 2 discussion appear to favor the 460 bob </s>
<s> your 8800 is that a 1gb or a 512mb </s>
<s> just curious </s>
<s> i don t know but i can share some experience </s>
<s> i had a 400mhz a 1 2mhz and 2 4mhz pcs on my lan a few yrs ago all were maxed with ram i have alot of dated nvdia video cards laying around so i eperimented i was curious if a slow machine would benefit from a fast video card i started with a 32mb in the 400 then 64 128 and finally a 256 all cards used the same nvidia driver so it was easy thanks nvidia </s>
<s> i installed tiger woods 2003 and went to work i figured anything above a 32 or 64 would be useless overkill on that ancient 400 but i was wrong the game ran smoother and smoother untill i reached my 256 ceiling </s>
<s> i still have that 1 2 and just installed lord of the rings on it the game demands a 1 8 cpu min yet my 1 2 runs it smooth with a 7600gs 512mb installed </s>
<s> even though the 7600 wants a 8x agp slot and the 1 2 only supports a 4x experiment results say fast video cards are worth it in any machine cpu s are a distant second in comparison </s>
