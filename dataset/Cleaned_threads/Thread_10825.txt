<s> first i have read through the forums </s>
<s> seconds here is my problem i have a 500gb external hd from western digital </s>
<s> up until earlier tonight it was working fine </s>
<s> now however it shows up in the safely remove hardware window under usb mass storage device as wd and it also shows up under the computer management window under device manager disk drives wd </s>
<s> under the computer management window when i click the connect option from the right click menu option of removable storage which is under storage it says the service cannot be started either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it </s>
<s> this snapin s display may be inconsistent with the removable storage device </s>
<s> if the problem persists please restart the snapin </s>
<s> under disk management 5 drives come up my c drive my d which is assigned to my cd dvd rw drive two unlettered drives and a drive labeled mediadirect the last three are all fat or fat32 file systems none of which has the 500gb capacity that my external hd should </s>
<s> they all have healthy status though two of the partitions are of unknown variety </s>
<s> i would really appreciate any help anyone could offer and thank you so much for your time and help </s>
<s> i forgot to mention the only event that i can think of that immediately preceded the drive not working was that the external drive lost power while it was still plugged in </s>
<s> however i figured i could treat this similarly to the drive being disconnected from the usb port by accident and simply restart the computer to have it read the drive properly </s>
<s> this did not work and now i am stuck in my current situation </s>
<s> trying the drive on another pc </s>
<s> if it fails there also it s time to disassemble it to find out if the failure is caused by the drive or by the enclosure that are the two parts roughly speaking </s>
<s> if it works there and not on your pc try it on another usb port and try another external disk also </s>
<s> taken together you ll get a much better picture of the problem than you ve got now </s>
<s> i assume you tried a power down reboot on this pc already as the first thing of course </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i tried it on another pc the other knight and the same exact thing occurred so i m thinking it must be the drive itself as opposed to the computer </s>
<s> knowing that though i m not sure where to go from here as i have little experience with external hd this being my first </s>
<s> thank you for the response though </s>
<s> it ended well but i was remiss in looking in the event viewer </s>
<s> read </s>
<s> an external drive consists of an enclosure and the drive itself that you put in connect and fasten with a few screws </s>
<s> both can be gone south </s>
<s> if it s the enclosure you can mount the drive in a new one and everything will be fine </s>
<s> if it s the disk you ll have to buy a new disk and put in in the old enclosure or buy a new set </s>
<s> you can only find out by trying </s>
<s> if you don t feel confident to do it yourself a visit to a nearby computershop might be useful </s>
<s> they ll be happy to check it for you provided you buy the replacement with them </s>
<s> kees </s>
