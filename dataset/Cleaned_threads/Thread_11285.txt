<s> what i was thinking of doing is taking a router from the house that connects to the dsl modem and from router to pc to the garage where a router would be set up as a switch with wireless capabilities </s>
<s> i need the pcs to have file sharing </s>
<s> i would love to see diagrams if anyone has links to them </s>
