<s> i am looking for a good quality printer good sharp text and colored graphics once in a while </s>
<s> i am plan to use this for school work processes in the home and am deciding which one would be best for me </s>
<s> why is laser so much more expensive when i see that the ppm is even less on for example hp laserjet 2600n compared to other hp injets </s>
<s> i will be printing text often and i don t want to have to run out of ink very quick </s>
<s> good speed would be nice too but it doesn t have to be lightning quick or anything </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> how is the hp laserjet 2600n compared to mainstream a lot chepaer hp injets </s>
<s> i think the inkjets ink will need to be replaced a lot sooner but quality speed wise </s>
<s> affordibility sheet ect </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> then go for laser printer </s>
<s> the cost page is much cheaper compare to inkjet </s>
<s> the initial investment maybe a bit expensive but worth it pays back in the long run </s>
<s> i only use inkjet at home since i don t print often </s>
<s> about 5 or 6 text pages a day </s>
<s> injet is slow i have epson stylus c42 </s>
<s> so i want a machine with good printing speed as well as cheaper cost page </s>
