<s> this is a simple question does anyone have a preference between the ati radeon 9700 pro or the radeon 9800 pro they are almost identical cards and thier benchmarks are close so i am just wondering if anyone has a preference </s>
<s> my preference is to avoid ati cards they have so many driver problems that you are going to find out about their quot driver of the month quot issues in a short time </s>
<s> how you need one driver to play one game and another to get another to work properly </s>
<s> not a fun situation </s>
<s> between the time i wrote this post and now i have changed back to wanting a good old nvidia i have never used ati yet all my cards are nvidia but none are very good i still have my old geforce 2 mx200 so now my question shifts to will there be a considerable difference between the geforce fx 5600 ultra and the geforce fx 5700 ultra </s>
<s> i would prefer the 5600 since it costs less and has vivo </s>
<s> check out for reviews on different cards </s>
<s> here is where he reviews the 5700 and 5950 </s>
<s> listing of latest agp video graphics cards specs as of dec 29 for performance on how they rate scroll on down to near the end of the page for benchmarks then check out how each card comes out comparatively with the 10 different games tested with them </s>
<s> like the moderator i personally prefer nvidia cards after reading about problems even with the newest ati cards </s>
<s> jr </s>
<s> thanks for the info i found alot and now i can make an informed decision thanks for finding that page </s>
