<s> i keep my pc on at all times except when there is a major lightning storm when i do turn it off </s>
<s> as an electrical engineer i feel by leaving the pc on keeps the electronics at a more uniform temperature and eliminates the surges that occur when turning it on </s>
<s> possibly turning it off overnight would not be to bad but it is saving a minimal amount of kwhr to be left off </s>
<s> turning it off on for several times a day is not very good for the electronics </s>
<s> i highly agree about this further reasons the heating and cooling effect of turning on and off your computer can cause solder joints to quot dry out quot making them less conductive and brittle </s>
<s> this causes easy breakability and overall unstability of your computer </s>
<s> so it is definately worth the extra dollar a month to keep your computer running </s>
<s> hi sciencebook </s>
<s> it s arguable very whether it s better for you to keep it on or off </s>
<s> but in terms of energy demand and we re going back into what was once called an quot energy crisis quot and global warming the answer is simple turn it off </s>
<s> furthermore if you re on a network or broadband the increased risk of someone sneaking in an open port and doing nasty things with the computer again outweigh the arguable benefit in longevity </s>
