<s> it s been suggested that i should add ram to my pc </s>
<s> i currently have 1gb ddr2 sdram at 533mhz as purchased </s>
<s> other specs listed below </s>
<s> mfr says add 1gb minimum or more to give me 2 or 3gb total </s>
<s> supposedly it s an easy install for even a novice user just open box place the extra ram where it fits inside and make connections all per instructions they provide </s>
<s> some questions 1 after that install does pc need a complete os and s w reinstall </s>
<s> 2 since i ve never had any problems with slowness crashes apps not performing correctly etc </s>
<s> will adding ram give me any tangible benefits ones i may notice other than making my wallet slimmer </s>
<s> rarely a few times in 2 years it s occurred when working in psp for hours making lots of edits on lots of images the app froze up </s>
<s> an expert told me just reboot because the quot cache quot was likely full and reboot would empty the cache and allow me to continue and this worked </s>
<s> 3 is that quot full cache quot related to my amount of ram </s>
<s> i m not sure why this has been suggested other than to sell me more stuff my ram capacity is quot not up to current new pc level quot i see new ones with 2 3 or 4 gb as standard and i ve heard that 1gb is just not enough for my uses </s>
<s> image editing video audio dvd and cd editing and creation no hours long video encoding sessions </s>
<s> 4 wouldn t i have noticed by now if my ram was lacking </s>
<s> 5 what are usual indicators of needing more ram </s>
<s> like 3 above </s>
<s> doing analog video capture i don t rely on pc processing power like with just a capture card i have a 3rd party hardware software combo connected to pc with usb2 0 </s>
<s> dell xps400 pentium d 820 2 8ghz dualcore 160gb sata ii 7200rpm hd windows xp pro mce 2005 hd only 50 full at any time </s>
<s> please advise </s>
<s> thanks stephen </s>
<s> 16 bucks </s>
<s> if your wallet can handle that might be worth a shot </s>
<s> think of ram as your computers gas tank and the processor is the engine </s>
<s> if you use editing programs for pics and whatnot this requires a big gas tank as they are the most memory hogging programs most people use </s>
<s> if you have windows xp i would suggest getting 2 to 3 gigs of ram for the best performance if vista get 4 to 5 gigs and remember you can only use ram that your motherboard supports i e </s>
<s> the ram sped you already have and you also if getting more than 1 stick of ram have to use the same ram example if you have a stick of 1gig ram at 533mhz and want more only put in another stick exactly the same and you will notce improvement yes 1 gig for xp is not enough for video and stills editing </s>
<s> hope that helps </s>
<s> ok so ram pkg to be added should have exact same specs as existing if i understand </s>
<s> mfr s site showed all size options at 667 speed only huh </s>
<s> bob s link to kingston offered both 667 and my pc s 533 the part abt adding same stick for stick ram seems easy enough but i m confused on these questions a how do i id what i have one 1gb stick or two 500mb sticks </s>
<s> someone said that with a dualcore processor it might be 2 500s </s>
<s> b and kingston tech specs on these says modules must be ordered and installed in pairs for dual channel mode </s>
<s> does this mean same as dualcore </s>
<s> if yes then logical that i would have two 500s and then would add two more </s>
<s> c a brief yes no regarding questions 1 3 of my first post please </s>
<s> pop the cover or side off the tower </s>
<s> first and foremost blow all the dust out of there </s>
<s> next locate the ram chips </s>
<s> my dell uses pairs of ram chips </s>
<s> if yours uses one only buy the exact same size chip and add it to an open slot </s>
<s> if you need to add them in pairs they need to be matching pairs </s>
<s> my dell can accept 4 chips at once </s>
<s> i am going to install larger chips today after work </s>
<s> if you need to move chips around be careful snapping them back in it may take a bit of gentle force to seat them properly </s>
<s> the highest power chip s should be in the primary slot s </s>
<s> the lower power chip s should be in the extra slot s </s>
<s> on my dell the primary slots have white clips the extra slots have black clips </s>
<s> make sure that you do not exceed the maximum amount of ram your system can support </s>
<s> if you pull an original chip it should say what powers it has mb and mz on the chip label </s>
<s> or should also be able to see exactly what is in your computer by looking at the original reciept or going to the manufacter s site and entering the seriel number or by looking in my computer then clicking on view system information for xp users </s>
<s> it s dells motherboard so they will know how fast a ram speed you can put in that computer ram with any faster speed wont be supported by your motherboard so your ram is limited by your mb speed wise </s>
<s> how to i d your ram call dell and ask them if your going to just add ram to your existing ram </s>
<s> if your going to buy all new ram all you need to know is ram speed supported by your mb and buy all same </s>
<s> answer to question 1 no </s>
<s> question 3 yes after you install more ram windows will also increase your virtual memory and you shouldn t have this problem anymore </s>
<s> now to have your virtual memory optimized since windows will increase it and it may not create 1 continuous block for it download this tweak guide and look in the index for the virtual memory optimization and follow the instructions good luck download your o s </s>
