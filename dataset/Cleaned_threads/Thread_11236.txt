<s> i am currently using an ati 9250 rad 256 card pci for video </s>
<s> i have a linksys 10 100 network card </s>
<s> what would be the point of upgrading to an agp 4x or 8x or a 16x pcie card </s>
<s> i am wondering if my network card would even support the bandwidth that these cards supply </s>
<s> during ftp i can get up to 3 5 megs a sec but if what i am reading is correct my pci video card will deliver up to 120 something megs a sec </s>
<s> so what is the point of getting a more powerful card that will deliver 2 to 4 gigs a sec if my network doesnt </s>
<s> support that rate of transfer </s>
<s> i am currently on a cable modem not a t1 line but am confused at this point as to what is the point of the higher end agp and pci cards </s>
<s> mainly i am curious about multi player games and the i know that i am missing some basic facts but cant seem to find a relevant source online that points me in the right direction </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>

<s> 5th tech site and no one responds </s>
<s> am i just a total newb or is it a question that cant be answered </s>
<s> but in short the faster the tranfer rate then the less time lost for the cpu to not have access to ram or i o </s>
<s> even a few millisecond wait by the cpu is some million cycles lost </s>
