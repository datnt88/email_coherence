<s> i just bought a 17 quot acer al1715 monitor for my daughter </s>
<s> she lives a ways from me and so it s hard for me to help her </s>
<s> she has it set up and says it looks pretty good </s>
<s> however she has been advised by a co worker to download a driver </s>
<s> one did not come with the monitor and apparently wasn t supposed to </s>
<s> she did download a driver and saved it to her desktop </s>
<s> no matter what she does she can t install it and wizard is telling her it can t find it </s>
<s> anyone familiar with this problem </s>
<s> we would greatly appreciate any help you can give us </s>
<s> her operating system is winxp </s>
<s> thanks val </s>
<s> if the monitor work like she said then why she need a driver </s>
<s> she says her friend who is into graphics told her it would be better with the acer driver </s>
<s> when she s on her home page it is too small </s>
<s> i think that could be corrected </s>
<s> we were able to download a driver but can t install it or open it </s>
<s> there are five icons and none of them seem to be for installation </s>
<s> i m thoroughly confused by this </s>
<s> thanks for getting back to me </s>
<s> val </s>
<s> drivers are for the video card not the monitor </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> john i m so glad i checked back </s>
<s> i d about given up </s>
<s> what you said was what i thought but this guy in the know that my daughter works with thought differently </s>
<s> i ve got one of these monitors coming to me and i m glad to have the problem solved </s>
<s> thanks a bunch </s>
