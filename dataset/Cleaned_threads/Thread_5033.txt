<s> hi i have a 12 quot g4 powerbook 1 5 ghz powerpc g4 512 mb ddr sdram running os 10 3 9 with one of those crap matshita dvd r uj 835e superdrives that i haven t had the cash to replace until now </s>
<s> there are two places i m thinking of using macservice iresq both companies install the panasonic 8x dual layer which i understand is what apple also uses </s>
<s> my questions 1 is the panasonic as unreliable and prone to breakdown as i understand the matshita to have been </s>
<s> 2 is there a better drive out there </s>
<s> i ve heard that pioneer dvr k05 is more reliable </s>
<s> 3 if you think i should just go with the panasonic do you have anything positive negative to say about either of these companies </s>
<s> thanks in advance for your help </s>
<s> while you may call the uj 835e carp i want to share with you a problem i see in the industry </s>
<s> they didn t do a good job of relaying that all these low prices came at the cost of lower years of life in the products </s>
<s> so i want to warn you that your replacement drive will likely last just as long as your uj 835e </s>
<s> that being said i try to shop at the usual mac outlets since they ll get me the drive that will quot just work quot i know i get to replace these things about every 1 to 3 years depending on a variety of factors </s>

<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> you re right on </s>
<s> i think i m going with the pioneer drive </s>
<s> i hope i ve saved you from the rma dance </s>
