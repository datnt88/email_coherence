<s> sorry i m reposting my question here too because it s related to my wireless card in notebook problem i hope someone will be able to help me fix my problem i have a compaq 2100 notebook </s>
<s> recently i installed a d link wireless card airplus g dwl g630 and it was working fine </s>
<s> one day i decided to see how will the connection work outside my appartment at school </s>
<s> well as soon as i inserted the d link card a msg popped up saying smt about windows i cannot recall exactly what and seconds later the screen went blue with a long message about a recently installed drive etc </s>
<s> so as i later found out i had to go to the d link website and install the last version of the drive </s>
<s> btw when i came back home i had no problems with the comp </s>
<s> i installed it and everything was fine even outside my building </s>
<s> about 10 days later i started having problems at home </s>
<s> very slow response to action frozen screen with the mouse moving but unable to click and finally the blue screen thing again </s>
<s> i read online about someone having the same problem and installed updates for my compaq 2100 nothing changed </s>
<s> today i finally decided to remove d link and couple other things </s>
<s> i ran the registry mechanic hijackthis ad ware and stuff like that even clean up </s>
<s> i kept having the same problem </s>
<s> after the blue screen the computer reboots and can never fully reload </s>
<s> it either stops at a certain point frozen or when i try to press f8 it wouldn t respond and continue until some point </s>
<s> i also tried to run the safe mode but it wouldn t do it </s>
<s> the last good version thing did not work i just turn it off let it cool down and try again </s>
<s> it starts running fine until a certain point when it grows lazy freezes and gives me the finger blue screen and all that sh crap all over again </s>
<s> sorry for the long explanation </s>
<s> hope someobody will suggest something useful thanks in advance attila </s>
<s> can be a sign of failing hardware </s>
<s> the first place i would look is to the hard drive </s>
<s> a boot to your xp cd didn t see your os in the post and into the recovery console </s>
<s> from there i would run chkdsk c r from the command prompt </s>
<s> i gave it away and no one else could make it work </s>
<s> sometimes you get a dud </s>
<s> try another make model </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i also have a d link 630 adapter card with same syptoms you have on my sony vaio </s>
<s> i could not get mine to work correctly and found posts on various forums with everybody having the same problem with d link cards and usb adapters </s>
<s> uninstall your drivers </s>
<s> accect your loss and buy a new card or usb adapter of a different brand </s>
<s> i bought a netgear adapter card wg511 and it works great </s>
<s> no problems with my network or anybody elses </s>
<s> you can usually catch them onsale for around 30 dollars </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> yep </s>
<s> it was a sign of a hard disk failure </s>
<s> i ve had my compaq for 2 yrs now </s>
<s> the 2yr warranty just expired a month ago </s>
<s> i bought a new hd thanx anyways </s>
