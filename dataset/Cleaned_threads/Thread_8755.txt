<s> i ve been doing some fairly heavy duty scanning in recent days with my canon mp830 multifunction printer scanner </s>
<s> suddenly whenever i use the auto document feeder it scans in a thin line running the full length of the document from top to bottom about 1 4 of the document in from the left margin </s>
<s> the line appears blue in a color document and also appears in black and white scans </s>
<s> interestingly the line only appears on scans using the adf </s>
<s> when i put the document directly on the platen glass there is no line </s>
<s> and the paper document itself comes out of the process without any issues so it s not as if the adf or scanning process is somehow leaving a mark on the paper document which is being scanned in </s>
<s> i m stumped </s>
<s> the only thing i can figure is that one of the thin wires that the scanner bulb moves back and forth on is somehow getting scanned in </s>
<s> but i have no idea </s>
<s> anyone experienced something like this </s>
<s> i figured it out </s>
<s> the problem was one tiny speck on the platen glass that is used during the adf scanning process </s>
<s> somehow in all the cleaning i did i missed this spot and had to be at just the right angle to see it </s>
<s> this worked for me </s>
