<s> i ve been using a linksys wireless g broadband router which works good depending on my location in the house as good as one would expect </s>
<s> i also have connected devices pvr s at different points in my house that are connected via the 4 ports of the router </s>
<s> i recently came upon a spare wireless b access point linksys as well that i was planning to connect to the network through one of the cat 5s that was being used by a pvr </s>
<s> is this possible </s>
<s> i did try connecting it and the signal is excellent in that area but i do not have internet access with that connection </s>
<s> it s listed as a seperate possible connection point might it be because the 1st wireless device has wep </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
