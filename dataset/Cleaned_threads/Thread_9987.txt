<s> desktop with windows xp toshiba laptop with windows vista linksys wireless g wrt54g broadband router arris cable modem hp psc1400 all in one printer having problems setting up a network environment allowing my laptop to access my printer connected to my desktop </s>
<s> i want to be able to be in another room in the house and print from my laptop without having to connect my laptop to the printer </s>
<s> i have ran the network wizard and the laptop sees the main computer name but that is all </s>
<s> any help will be greatly appreciated gt what do i need to make this work </s>
<s> do you have a duplicate account on your desktop that will authenticate you and grant access to the printer </s>
<s> not sure what you mean by duplicate account try to explain in a way ill understand </s>
<s> have you log in </s>
<s> let s say you log in as quot dudley quot </s>
<s> now when you want to print to another machine s printer quot dudley quot must have an account on the other machine </s>
<s> plus all the other things that need to be right as well </s>
<s> simple test for that </s>
<s> go to the other machine log off and can quot dudley quot log in with the same name and password as the other machine </s>
<s> ok thanks ill give it a try </s>
<s> we recently went through the same thing </s>
<s> when my husband loaded the printer driver on my laptop everything worked fine </s>
<s> hey hadnt thought of that i actually went to a bookstore here and did some reading </s>
<s> and that was one thing i did not do so im gonna give that a shot </s>
<s> thanks </s>
