<s> i have a compaq presario mv540 operating system is window mil one day when i was playing a game reading blaster with my 4 yr old son i heard a shattering sound and the computer froze i opened the cd drive and the cd literally shattered into hundreds of pieces and the cd rom has not worked ever since </s>
<s> so i use the cd burner to run cd s </s>
<s> now the cd drive will not even open </s>
<s> there is nothing in the drive but i push the button and nothing happens </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> small pieces of plastic can lodge in the gears </s>
<s> either take apart yourself and clean it out or get a new one recommended </s>
<s> since the speed of a drive is quite fast an electronic component could also have been damaged </s>
<s> replace it </s>
<s> cd drives are 20 bucks or less </s>

<s> a lot of drives have a small hole in the front just big enough for a paper clip wire </s>
<s> that s exactly what the hole if for to manually open the drive </s>
<s> you do so by pushing straight in the hole with enough force to lift the heads up and start the door to open </s>
<s> i might guess the drive belt that operates the door is damaged or off the pulley </s>
<s> when this happens you hear the drive try but it just cannot open </s>
<s> to manually pop open a cd drive take a small pin or a small safety pin open or a very thin paper clip unfolded and insert it into the tiny little hole located somewhere on the cd drive s face </s>
<s> look carefully almost every cd rom writer drive has one for opening the drive manually </s>
<s> when you locate the hole press the pointed object into the hole carefully while at the same time pressing the button you press to pop open the cd drive normally </s>
<s> it should pop open no problem </s>
<s> i hope this helps </s>
<s> the exploding cd in drive has happened to me too i feel your pain </s>
<s> thank you so much for this advice </s>
<s> our e drive was stuck shut and after reading this thread i used a cake tester to open it </s>
<s> i could see that the belt was broken </s>
<s> i just cant wait to show my hubby who sat here for an hour trying to fix it </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> dear friends the main question was the drive did not respond and there was no cd in the drive </s>
<s> it could be the mechanical problem but in this case i feel its the power supply problem or a dead drive </s>
<s> if you could see a light on the drive when u press a button or when you start the system then it could be a mechanism problem or a faulty drive </s>
<s> if you dont see any light at any time then the problem is with the power supply to the drive or a dead drive </s>
<s> just open the chasis and check for the connections or try with a free power cord </s>
<s> hope this is useful </s>
<s> reply if it works </s>
