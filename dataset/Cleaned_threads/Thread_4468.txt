<s> i just added a new 100 gb hard drive to my dell desktop computer because i ran out of storage </s>
<s> i need to know how to transfer all files and data from my old drive to the new </s>
<s> i specifically tried to transfer my itunes folder to the new drive since it was the largest folder and it didn t work </s>
<s> i suspect it has to do with system files being on the quot c quot original drive and the programs don t know to look for the songs on the quot f quot new drive </s>
<s> should i just quot disk copy quot or purchase a transfer utility program </s>
<s> if there is an easier solution i would be gratefule for the tip </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> is the easiest for most files documents folders </s>
<s> you cannot move programs you have to uninstall them and reinstall them paying close attention to the destination drive in the process </s>
<s> but some programs may not run from a slave drive </s>
<s> you ll just have to test it </s>
<s> but just plain data such as pictures documents etc </s>
<s> can be just dragged and dropped </s>
<s> itunes locks the music to the my documents folder so it ll have to stay </s>
<s> there is a way to redirect itunes to another folder but it is a pita to configure </s>
<s> more information and about a two page tutorial on the process at the itunes site </s>
<s> thanks for the advice </s>
<s> i will check out itunes to get the full picture </s>
