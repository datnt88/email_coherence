<s> picked up a new motherboard 4 20 yay for me lol </s>
<s> i wanted it because it works was cheap but mainly because it can hold up to 4gb of ram </s>
<s> i m not a pro at this but i love my games </s>
<s> the only problem is that it has 5 pci slot 1 agu and no pci e slots </s>
<s> can any one name a few of the best card i can fit in a pci slot </s>
<s> and or agu </s>
<s> ps </s>
<s> under 200 would help this poor boy </s>
<s> 1 newegg com to see what agp cards may be had for under 200 bucks </s>
<s> 2 armed with that list i head to tomshardware com and see how each card fares on the vgacharts </s>
<s> just so you know i won t do this for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> agu slot </s>
<s> i think you mean agp </s>
<s> what is the manufacturer name and model name of your motherboard </s>
<s> what are the rest of the components in your computer build </s>
<s> you won t use more than 2gb of ram for gaming so getting a 4gb motherboard is not an issue </s>
<s> if you pay more for a motherboard with a pci express x16 expansion slot you likely can get a more powerful pci express x16 video card for a price less than a comparable agp video card </s>
<s> thanks for the links very helpful </s>
