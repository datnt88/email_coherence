<s> also noticed when i m rebooting from a crash the processor is now reaching temps of 43c on a regular basis </s>
<s> have removed processor and re applied new ht paste and have made sure processor fan which was upgraded to a thermaltake tr2 r1 fan when i upgraded from the onboard gpu to the radeon x1300 and it s heat dissipating fins are clean </s>
