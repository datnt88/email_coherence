<s> recently my 1 year old pc suddenly unable to detect the master sata hard disk drive </s>
<s> so i have no choice but to revert to my old ide hdd and meanwhile i purchased another sata hdd as a back up to this ide hdd </s>
<s> but upon installing this brand new sata hdd again my pc bios cannot detect it </s>
<s> it looks like the problem all the while is concerning the sata function of my motherboard rather than the sata hdd itself </s>
<s> what went wrong </s>
<s> 2 is the bios current </s>
<s> 3 why are the details not in your post </s>
<s> hint make model version revision pictures stories etc </s>

<s> my apologies here are my system specs operating system windows xp professional sp2 motherboard msi 865pe neo2 p 2004 bios as per original not updated hard disk seagate barracuda 80g sata 2004 maxtor diamondmax plus 9 80g sata 2005 quantum fireball 20g ide 2002 i am now running on the ide hdd because basically it is the only drive detectable by my pc </s>
<s> quot bios as per original not updated quot i know to update it as i get hardware to sidestep issues like these </s>
<s> there is another possible issue here but i can t tell in your posts </s>
<s> you may have tried to install xp onto a sata drive without supplying drivers along the way </s>
<s> this rarely works </s>
<s> the motherboard manual should detail what s needed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i did not want to temper with the bios as long as the pc can operate this was fine over a year until recently the sata hdd was suddenly undetectable </s>
<s> i guess i m wrong </s>
<s> should must i update the bios </s>
<s> i was forced to re install xp on an older ide hdd and it is working </s>
<s> but a newly purchsed sata hdd cannot be detected so i suspect the motherboard s sata function is damaged </s>
<s> it s a lesson i learned a long time ago </s>
<s> you can goto the motherboard maker s web page and read what was fixed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ieee bob recommended a good start </s>
<s> no manufacturer will want to talk to you unless you have up to date bios </s>
<s> however since this failure occurred on two seperate new drives i suspect you have a motherboard failure </s>
<s> the motherboard should also have more than one sata port on it </s>
<s> try moving the cables to a different port plugs on the board itself and try that </s>
<s> hopefully you only have a partail failure of your motherboard s sata controllers </s>
<s> let us know ok </s>
<s> regards jack </s>
<s> in my case a stock hp media pc m7248n with a msi ms 7184 amethystm micro atx motherboard </s>
<s> the power in the house went down so the box took a hard powerhit </s>
<s> after the power came back the same old sata root drive that came with the box was undetectable </s>
<s> looking at it on another box the disk is fine that leaves the motherboard </s>
<s> same situation stock bios no hardware changes no intervening msft updates box was working box takes powerhit box not working </s>
<s> i conclude bios has nothing to do with it </s>
<s> i was never totally thrilled with this pc </s>
<s> when i first got the box minor physical shock would cause the system to hang </s>
<s> i reseated all the memory chips and the problem went away </s>
<s> maybe i ll try punching in the disk parameters manually but bios just doesn t see it </s>
