<s> ok the story goes i bought this epson c82 inkjet printer about 4 months ago </s>
<s> now i ran out of black awhile ago and bought some at a discount online and things have been fine until i ran out of magenta now nothing is printing so i replaced all with epson c80 ink from office depot still no printing i cleaned the heads 5 times did all mantenience and nothing </s>
<s> so i thought it was the c80 ink </s>
<s> so i bought c82 ink at a discount online and tried printing just a cover letter and all i got is just some streaks then i tried a photo setting and i got a very faint and streaked print sooo i called epson customer service and they want to charge me 9 for their help forget that can anyone help or do i have to pay the 9 for a phone call </s>
<s> i want to throw this thing out the window help </s>
<s> thanks mike </s>
<s> what will irk most is that service and support will cost more than replacing the printer </s>
<s> perils of lower costs </s>
<s> i will not write much about why removing free support lowers the initial cost of the printer but i have learned to just pay the piper on ink cartridges </s>
<s> the epson has some superfine nozzles and i can t say if non epson ink will clog </s>
<s> but will note that your warranty is void now and i d open the window before tossing it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> go ahead and throw it out the window </s>
<s> but before that try repeated cleanings as many as 10x or more </s>
<s> yes that will use alot of ink </s>
<s> however if you really don t want to spend money on ink then buy a replacement as a quot on sale quot printer may be as close as the ink carts cost </s>
<s> now next time use epson ink costs alot consider your past experience and if it ever goes dry install a new ink cart quickly </s>
<s> epson printers work great when they do and just are a pita when they don t imho and i don t recommend them </s>
<s> sorry willy </s>
<s> are you running the nozzle check </s>
<s> if so does it show anything now that you have replaced the cartridges again </s>
<s> be aware that pulling out a cartridge and putting it back in is a no no with an epson it can leave a bubble in the nozzle that will not clear up easily </s>
<s> you really need to clean until you get a complete nozzle check pattern </s>
<s> at this point about all you can do is try repeatedly printing a nozzle check each time </s>
<s> it should improve with each cleaning </s>
<s> you can buy cartridges that have cleaning fluid in them that may fix it </s>
