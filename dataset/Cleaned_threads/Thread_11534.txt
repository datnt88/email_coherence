<s> i would like a list of good quality camcorders that work well with our new pro and imovie 11 </s>
<s> was hoping to get hd camcorder but if the mac pro can t handle mpeg 4 files we will settle for what the mac can handle </s>
<s> we want to record classical music ensembles good audio required probably low light maybe zoom to single players as well as modern dance and gymnastics </s>
<s> important that modest editing can be done in imovie though could purchase another program but not the very expensive professional program </s>
<s> want to produce good quality audio video file that can be played on pc s as well as macs and that can be burned onto dvd </s>
<s> would also like to play videos from the mac on our hd tv </s>
<s> a full list of camcorders would be appreciated </s>
<s> there were so many quot visual stabiliztion limitations quot with ilife 09 listed on the mac website i suspect that the list of compatible camcorders for ilife 11 is small </s>
<s> i hope that apple and mac fans will be upfront and guide us to a camcorder that really works well with a new macbook pro </s>
<s> thanks very much i will report back on our choice hopefully in the next 4 5 weeks </s>
<s> i can tell you that most of the hard drive based cameras work well with imovie </s>
<s> avoid like the plague any camera that puts the video directly down onto a dvd </s>
<s> because the dvd is the finished thing it is extremely difficult to edit the footage without having to convert the footage to dv or something similar </s>
<s> and then because it is sunday and i have nothing to do right now i went in search of a definitive answer for you </s>
<s> i finally found it in imovie 11 under help </s>
<s> just select the options that you want remember to avoid dvd based cameras and hit the go button </s>
<s> voila </s>
<s> a list of compatible cameras </s>
<s> let us know what you decide p </s>
<s> imovie 11 is capable of stabilizing a shaky picture on its own </s>
<s> all the warning is saying is that any camera that uses the cmos image sensors often use a technology called a quot rolling shutter quot and that if you use imovie 11 video stabilization when you are editing the raw footage you will likely have a result that looks distorted </s>
<s> a workaround is to either use a tripod while filming your event which will give you a stable picture to begin with or do not use imovie 11 s built in video stabilization feature </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> help apple com is one of my trusted websites but the options in any combination render a warning window with an exclamation in a yellow triangle and a quot yes quot with an ok button </s>
<s> when i click the button nothing happens </s>
<s> why is this happening </s>
<s> i have tried several combinations same result </s>
<s> am running a windows 7 os my daughter owns the mac pro </s>
<s> thanks for the info about the stabilization issue especially if we get a camcorder with a cmos image sensor </s>
<s> does this mean that we can turn off ilife s built in video stabilization feature to get a less distorted picture </s>
<s> i can t check that right now mac pro is not in the house </s>
<s> i will definitely get a tripod for concert and dance recordings so i hope the pictures will be stable to begin with </s>
<s> thanks again awaiting reply about the mac website with options to find compatible camcorder though maybe i have to ask for help from apple </s>
<s> the video stabilization is not something that needs to be turned off in imovie it is off by default </s>
<s> to stabilize a piece of video there are a number of steps to got through before it does its thing </s>
<s> not sure what is happening with the apple site for you with windows 7 i ll check with a winbox here only xp and see if i have the same problem </s>
<s> just checked works fine in xp with ie and firefox </s>
<s> try it with firefox and see if you get the same result </s>
