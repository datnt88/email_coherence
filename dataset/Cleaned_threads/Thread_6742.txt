<s> a friend gave me a stick of ram that he wasn t using anymore </s>
<s> i would like to know how to tell if it will work in my computer </s>
<s> my computer is a dell dimension 2100 running windows me </s>
<s> it has one 128mb stick of ram in it </s>
<s> i think it uses sdram but i m not positive </s>
<s> any help anyone can give me would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> go to crucial com and enter your computer model in the crucial memory advisor tool </s>
<s> when i did that crucial com says that your computer takes pc133 type memory modules </s>
<s> two 256mb modules equals the maximum of 512mb </s>
<s> see if you get the same information </s>
<s> about the stick of ram that was given to you what do the markings and or stickers say on it </s>
<s> i did get the same info on crucial </s>
<s> the stick has three stickers on it this is what the one that looks most relevent says ibm 9730 32mb 4m x 72 e 1334739jcc 10t </s>
<s> without google searching that info i can tell you that looks to be a 32mb ecc module </s>
<s> maybe someone will have more info </s>
<s> thank you so much for your help </s>
<s> i would like to ask you two more questions if that s alright </s>
<s> the first one being can i put that stick of memory in my computer </s>
<s> the second i also just received a box of old ram for another friend and he said that he thought if the a stick of ram had those two little notches in the bottom that they would work the ram that s already in my pc has the two notches </s>
<s> is this true </s>
<s> thanks again for all the help </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> sorry for the delay in my replys i have extremly slow dial up </s>
<s> if the notches match that s a good sign </s>
<s> investigate google each ram module to learn its type and size </s>
<s> i would only insert pc133 ram modules </s>
<s> some pc100 modules may work in that motherboard </s>
<s> for me it would be worth it to try some modules in that slot </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> that is an older computer and i wouldn t care if something were to go wrong </s>
<s> plus i don t invest in pc100 or pc133 ram these days </s>
<s> i would only upgrade that machine if i happened upon quot a box of old ram quot happy hunting </s>
