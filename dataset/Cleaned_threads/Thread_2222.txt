<s> as most of us know dell cannot recommend third party options for upgrading any hardware thus the hardware that comes with it remains however i have heard that you can replace the existing psu power supply unit with a third party one such as a thermaltake antec etc </s>
<s> however i have also heard that such psu s are not compatible with the dell motherboard </s>
<s> which of these are true </s>
<s> i don t want to ruin my system thanks </s>
<s> btw i have a dell xps 410 </s>
<s> they offer some psus for dells </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> not yours </s>
<s> so i m sharing i can use atx psus with the 24 pin adaptor or in my case the standard 20 pin atx without issue </s>
<s> mind you i ve done my homework so i have zero issues here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so r proffitt just to clarify you can use a third patry atx power supply on your dell btx motherboard </s>
<s> the key is quot dell quot because some of their parts are proprietary from what i heard </s>
<s> okay so just to clarify you have a dell </s>
<s> just another btx </s>
<s> btx is a standard so i know i could use the atx supplies however you must do the work to see if the dimensions work for your dell case </s>
