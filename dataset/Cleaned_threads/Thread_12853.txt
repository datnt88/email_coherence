<s> as i am every time i look to buy a new pc i am in a quandary and hope a few cnet ers might chime in </s>
<s> for whatever reason i am a dell fan </s>
<s> over the years i ve purchased six of them </s>
<s> my mom s current pc a dell which is one of the six i ve purchased seems to have some serious issues </s>
<s> it runs as slow as molasses in february </s>
<s> mom lives in another state and instead of trying to figure out what s wrong with her pc several years old win xp we both agree she should simply get a new one </s>
<s> being a life long fan and perhaps having tunnel vision i want to get her another dell </s>
<s> i ve been looking at the inspiron i580 </s>
<s> as mom does little more on her pc than send emails and browse the internet i think it fits her needs </s>
<s> but i wonder should i consider another brand </s>
<s> hp perhaps </s>
<s> i know dell gets a lot of negative marks for their so called quot customer service quot heck just last week i telephoned dell s sales department with a few questions and reached india </s>
<s> i immediately hung up </s>
<s> but is that reason enough to not consider getting another dell </s>
<s> i am and have been a computer addict for well over a decade </s>
<s> and still i spend countless hours trying to figure out how to do find things on my relatively new win7 pc </s>
<s> mom is now in her 80 s </s>
<s> i fear mom will have a harder time transitioning to win7 from winxp than she did at a bit younger age from win98 to winxp </s>
<s> i m just brainstorming and hoping for some thoughts </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if you follow the forums here all vendors sooner or later get negative press </s>
<s> the more popular the vendor meaning they sold zillions the more likely bad press as well </s>
<s> that is no excuse though for off loading service to off shore customer support ie india </s>
<s> that only makes it worse and you already seem to know that </s>
<s> dell though will support better if you re an enterprise or business buyer maybe </s>
<s> it all depends on amounts etc but regardless the pcs themselves usually are decent </s>
<s> if you have some savvy and use of online support usually can resolve a host of issues using the dell support website </s>
<s> of course if you have to use any telco type support good luck considering all that you can buy dell again or some other vendor </s>
<s> overall i see dell has gotten to think it saves when support is offshore too bad </s>
<s> as for mom only you can gauge whatever action from buying new </s>
<s> win7 is more friendly to swapping over files pgms </s>
<s> etc and that is discussed widely here </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> why not try a mac for mom </s>
<s> if all she s doing is e mail web surf etc why not a macbook macbook air or macbook pro </s>
<s> there is also the new 21 5 quot imac that came out the other day </s>
<s> they certainly have much more ease of use and are great looking and long lasting </s>
<s> in my experience i ve given hp and dell 1 or 2 star rating mainly because they quit too soon </s>
<s> i switched to mac and have never regretted it </s>
<s> you say mom may have a hard time transitioning from win xp to 7 </s>
<s> i did and i m a computer wizz win 7 just didn t click for me </s>
<s> switching to mac os would be just as easy if not easier for her i think </s>
<s> just show her how to open the browser hit the web and it s all the same from there </s>
<s> the way it s laid out is very easy to understand </s>
<s> anyone but dell </s>
<s> several years ago i tried to buy a laptop on dell s website </s>
<s> i spent a couple of hours on their site reviewing their various models and options then put together an order with everything i wanted in the laptop </s>
<s> price was about 2 500 </s>
<s> completed the order and paid with my debit card </s>
<s> a few days went by but i never received any kind of confirmation email or other communication from dell </s>
<s> checked my bank account and there was no transaction from dell </s>
<s> logged back into their website and found that my order was on hold so i called them </s>
<s> the first guy i talked to said that they couldn t accept my debit card </s>
<s> when i asked why he said he didn t know and asked if i could use another card </s>
<s> so then i m wondering if there s something wrong with my card so i asked if i could speak to his supervisor </s>
<s> he gave me a name and a number in their finance office </s>
<s> it s not like i m some kind of financial deadbeat </s>
<s> at the time i was 50 years old had a six figure annual income owned my home and had been with my employer 20 years </s>
<s> when i called this other guy he was a real sob </s>
<s> when i asked if there was a problem with my card he said that he couldn t tell me that and asked if i had another card i could use </s>
<s> when i asked why they wouldn t accept my card he said he didn t have to answer that question and asked me again if i had another card i could use </s>
<s> when i said that i really needed to understand why they would not accept my debit card for payment he said that they were under no obligation to accept my debit card and that unless i gave him another card to complete the purchase he was going to cancel my order </s>
<s> so i told him okay and that i didn t think that i could do business with dell </s>
<s> have recommended against doing business with dell ever since </s>
<s> over the past ten years i have had four different computers </s>
<s> the first was a cyrix which was worthless and i returned it after about ten months for a full refund </s>
<s> i don t remember the brand of the second computer except that it was quot not quot a dell </s>
<s> it worked semi average at best for about two years before i needed to replace it </s>
<s> my third was a home grown or generic machine </s>
<s> i paid a friend 400 to build it for me </s>
<s> that included all parts he ordered from various places on the web and for his time as well </s>
<s> that computer worked well for several years better than anything else i had including my fourth and current machine which is the same as the one you are considering for your mom a dell inspiron 580 i have had it for about three years now and it has worked as well for me as the generic one but not any better </s>
<s> in my experience if you know someone who has tech ability to build one from scratch this would be my best advice </s>
<s> of course it still depends on what you would pay him versus a new dell inspiron because prices are probably now considerably lower than when i bought mine </s>
<s> i hope this helps you in some way </s>
<s> tim a </s>
<s> hi you ve had six machines from dell you obviously like them customer help desk apart is that an oxymoron </s>
<s> so i would guess you ve had few if any serious problems with them </s>
<s> so why not stick with the team you know </s>
<s> personally though i ve ordered quite a lot of these machines for business clients i really don t like them </s>
<s> the machines seem to be as reliable anyone else s and they have turned out some nice kit </s>
<s> but i have two reservations the number of proprietary parts the use and the significant difference usually between quot headline price quot low and quot configured price quot high </s>
<s> i like lenovo laptops hp desktops and hp and ibm x servers but that s just a personal preference like your dells </s>
<s> you may be right about the transition from xp to win7 though once you ve learned how to launch your applications and find your files there isn t too much difference </s>
<s> but you might want to investigate classic shell that will replace the start menu with something resembling xp s and windows explorer given a bit of fiddling around </s>
<s> but you do lose the new features of windows 7 such as libraries so it may be better to learn the new win7 interface </s>
