<s> hi i too am having a terrible time getting my new scanner to scan properly </s>
<s> i m running on an hp with windows xp don t think my computer is the problem </s>
<s> when scanning slides i get half the photo green half red </s>
<s> anybody have any idea what would be causing this </s>
<s> it s a brand new scanner i have yet to have any useable scans completed </s>
<s> grrrrrr </s>
<s> i too have had intermittant problems with the otherwise fantastic scanner </s>
<s> my issue is that occassionally i get colored bars that run parallel to the long width of the slide </s>
