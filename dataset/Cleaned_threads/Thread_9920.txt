<s> hello i have a ps 2 optical logitech mouse that works in linux ubuntu 8 04 but not in windows xp pro sp2 </s>
<s> it s plugged in when i start the computer so what s the deal </s>
<s> i ve attempted the following to get it to work check device manager no yellow or red devices try to use quot add hardware quot it found nothing tried to use quot add hardware quot manually no mouse in the selection suggestions on getting the thing to work </s>
<s> it s slightly annoying when using some programs to not have a mouse </s>
<s> the logitech mouse driver it can cause that </s>
<s> more at and there is a xp version of the article but i ll let you dig it out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no i haven t used the logitech drivers it was a mouse i received from a friend after my last mouse stopped working consistently i think it had a short in the wire </s>
<s> i just shut the computer down plugged the mouse in and turned the computer on </s>
<s> i can t remember but i think the first time or first couple times the mouse may have worked in windows though maybe not </s>
<s> aside from logitech drivers any other suggestions </s>
<s> the same filters can be installed by spyware and other maker s drivers </s>
<s> it s a common failure and unless the ps2 port or mouse is dead which your linux test shows it s not then this is the registry tree i check then i delete that and the files it points to </s>
<s> i consider this just above average user repairs so not everyone survives this one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so i booted back into windows today expecting the ps 2 mouse not to work or my wireless mouse to work dead battery i thought </s>
<s> to my surprise they both work and i haven t done anything to actually fix the situation </s>
<s> but hey i m not complaining </s>
<s> just figured i d let you all know that this computer is magical or something </s>
