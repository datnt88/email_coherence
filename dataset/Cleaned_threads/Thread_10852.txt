<s> good evening i have an hp a705w running win xp home edition that will not boot up </s>
<s> it will come to a screen that indicates that there is no os installed </s>
<s> when you try to run the recovery system it shuts itself down </s>
<s> i have tried replacing the hdd according to the hp support site and as soon as the system attempts to access the hdd all it will do is shut itself off </s>
<s> any other suggestions </s>
<s> just a quick checklist did you visit a quot bad quot site </s>

<s> what other hardware are you running </s>
<s> if you know is anything overclocked </s>

<s> power supply dying </s>
<s> is it under warranty </s>
