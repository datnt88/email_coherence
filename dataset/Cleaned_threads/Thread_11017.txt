<s> i just bought a maxtor basics personal storage 3200 100 gb 7200 rpm </s>
<s> so i just plugged it in and managed to get about 7 gb of files transfered </s>
<s> then it went retarded and my comp wouldn t recognize the drive in explorer there was no icon for an quot f drive quot </s>
<s> well it s recognized in disk mgmt and i can now create a partition and format the x drive it says with a max of 93 gb </s>
<s> question if i partition and format now will i lose that 7 gb of files i transfered earlier </s>
<s> in case it matters i have windows xp and sp2 upgraded </s>
<s> i guess it seems i will lose those 7 gb if i partition and format now </s>
<s> does anyone know how i can retrieve those files </s>
