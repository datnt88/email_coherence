<s> hello folks my new year started with a weird virus infecting the system and telling me that my hdd is crashing ram temp too high etc </s>
<s> it blocked my access to all files </s>
<s> i booted my pc with usb linux and copied all files to external hdd </s>
<s> now i restored pc to factory defaults but this hdd health is haunting me </s>
<s> i ran hdtune but i don t understand the results </s>
<s> i have uploaded screenshots at i will be very thankful if somebody could read it and let me know if i have a reason to worry </s>
<s> i really don t want hdd fail on me so if there is any sign i would like to replace hdd rightaway </s>
<s> the laptop is about 2 years old </s>
<s> hdd is not making any weird noise but it has happened that when i am working on it my toddler may lightly hit a laptop and it would warn me with a popup that it has parked hdd head to a safe location and i have never had any issue with corrupt file or something else like that </s>
<s> many thanks in advance </s>
<s> if i knew this laptop was running vista on 1gb ram then i would think nothing of the rather low numbers i saw on the graph image </s>
<s> as to the heat it is often the lack of maintenance </s>
<s> i have to ask if you are doing your own work or having it done every 6 months </s>
<s> some folk don t know we need to give the air vents a shot of canned air regularly to keep the machine s vents clear </s>

<s> this laptop is toshiba satellite a505 runs win7 x64 home premium with 4gb ram </s>
<s> i do all maintenance by myself </s>
<s> i have heard of cleaning air vent using air cans but honestly i am too scared too do that as i am afraid that instead of getting the dust out i will block it even further by pushing it in </s>
<s> may be i just need to know how to do it correctly </s>
<s> yes the numbers are a bit low but if the laptop is not getting regular maintenance with the basic simple canned air then what you reported would be normal </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the vent air out should be on the side of the unit induction air in is generally on the bottom of the unit </s>
<s> hold the laptop so that you can blow air through the induction input </s>
<s> make sure the laptop is off and don t hold the air too close stand it off several inches and blow it out </s>
<s> mindstyle the symptoms you re reporting sounds like they may be quot fake quot depending on what type of quot malware quot was installed </s>
<s> have a look at the below removal guides </s>
<s> note where the first states quot system fix is a fake computer analysis and optimization program from the fakehdd family of rogues </s>
<s> this rogue displays false alerts that are designed to make you think that your computer has hard disk problems that have lead to corrupt and missing data </s>
<s> quot further down the page there s a list of the false alerts </s>
<s> is it this what you re experiencing </s>
<s> are you being asked to pay for the program in order to fix it </s>
<s> remove system fix uninstall guide remove system check uninstall guide if so either of the guides should help you remove it </s>
<s> if not sounds if you have some physical cleaning to do </s>
<s> best of luck carol </s>
