<s> i have toshiba hd part mk2023gas which also has a hp part j6054b the drives work fine individually but when i try to connect them as master and slave none of the drives are detected </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> use the shiny new 80 conductor cable and set the drives to cable select </s>
<s> master slave is so 1990 s </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> besides what robert has already stated understand how your hd is actually configured by the jumpers </s>
<s> cable select should with the newer type 40 pin 80 wire ide cables provide the fix </s>
<s> if not then the hd jumpers may need an added jumper for solo or dual operation if applicable </s>
<s> so visit the hd makers website to see how they expect their operation to be set for dual install or check that decal sticker found on the hd </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
