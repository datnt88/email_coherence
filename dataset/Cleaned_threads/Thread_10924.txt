<s> my pc is in a sort of loop </s>
<s> it starts up and gets to the windows xp start up screen then shuts it self down and restarts </s>
<s> it will do this over and over as long as i leave it on </s>
<s> anyone know what is happening </s>
<s> but your details are so light that the only fix is to reload the os or take it to the shop </s>
<s> one could try a boot to safe mode to see if the os is not so damaged that repairs could be attempted but that detail is not known </s>
<s> gt are you seeing those words in red when you post </s>

<s> it will allow me to choose safe mode but it still shuts down at the same point </s>
<s> i have tried all the selections it offers and none make it past the windows cover screen </s>
<s> as soon as the cover screen goes off the pc restars </s>
<s> if you have the full xp cd you can install a parallel install of the os and gain access to your files to back up prior to attempter repair of the os </s>
<s> since all safe modes fail your reply even the command line one we now face an os repair and failing that an os install </s>
<s> here s the links for the parallel install </s>
<s> use the article you can follow </s>
<s> if none work for you then it s shop time since the hardware has likely failed </s>

<s> i will try the parallel install </s>
<s> thank you again for your help </s>
<s> i m running into more machines where the person installing xp skips installing motherboard and sata drivers </s>
<s> on some machines this will work for a short while i won t discuss why but later the machine goes into this reboot loop as noted </s>
<s> reinstalling the os works but later the same issue comes up </s>
<s> some call xp flawed on this point but i think it s a matter microsoft should have addressed rather than pushed off to telling us to install the os properly </s>
<s> yes they are busy on vista but how many run xp and encounter driver issues </s>
<s> here s an example proper sata install link </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this has happened on my desktop a few times i did a os reload it worked for a while but did not fix the core issue the core issue for me is my hard drive is bad </s>
<s> corruption basically is what is happening windows can not find files so it restarts and trys again </s>
<s> boot into repair mode f8 and try to skdisk or try spinrite </s>
<s> see if you can salvage the hd but eventually you will probably need to buy a new one </s>
<s> that is only one cause for the symptom but the most likely one </s>
