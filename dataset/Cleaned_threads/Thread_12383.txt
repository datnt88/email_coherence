<s> hello all i recently built a new machine basically from scratch </s>
<s> i have been running it for only a week or two so far and last night i happened to notice that the cpu was touching around 50 degrees c i remember reading in the manual that it took a good number of processing hours for the heatsink and thermal compound to reach maximum efficiency but i have to say i am still a little nervous about letting my cpu get above 50c </s>
<s> now keep in mind that i am not an overclocker nor do i wish to be </s>
<s> my new cpu is an amd athlon 64 x2 5200 and socket am2 </s>
<s> i am looking for plausible suggestion for cooling within an already well ventilated case </s>
<s> i use a lian li pc 60usb b2 with two front panel fans one back panel fan and a top panel exhaust fan </s>
<s> the proprietary fans for the cpu and the videocard are installed </s>
<s> any helpful replies will be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks eric </s>
<s> visit the amd cpu support website </s>
<s> you will find what is the temp </s>
<s> range the cpu can handle </s>
<s> overall at 50c i see no harm but check the website regradless for your cpu model </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> is the 50c at idle or under load </s>
<s> thanks for the links willy </s>
<s> i ll check out the docs and see if i can find the normal operating temps </s>
<s> vap i am using a program called easytuner that came along with my gigabyte mobo to measure rpm temp </s>
<s> max operating temperature c 55 70 the above is what i was able to track down for my particular cpu </s>
<s> when i was watching it on the easytuner app last night i saw that it was hovering right around 48 50 c this was after the machine had been up and running for a while </s>
<s> i had been playing games and running applications for probably a few hours </s>
<s> i guess it is still within it s safety zone </s>
<s> if anyone has a better suggestion for an app to measure stats i d be grateful </s>
<s> let us know what that says </s>
<s> vapcmd ps i ve got a an amd 4800 x2 and it isn t anywhere near that hot it runs under 30c 28c now at idle with the amds stock hs fan </s>
<s> ambient temp is 70f </s>
<s> actually from what i have read at intel tempature flucuations are more dangerous than some warmer than normal temp </s>
<s> reading i would go with a steady as she goes tempature reading and not create a pc environment that caused cold air to suddenly hit the machine surfaces i have had had high heat flags run on my machine and nothing ever happened this was with a celeron d 331 2 66ghz cpu i replaced that cpu w p4 531 3 0ghz and of course things run exactly so video rendering is cpu intensive w p4 i have no issues </s>
