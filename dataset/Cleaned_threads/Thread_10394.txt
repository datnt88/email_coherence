<s> i have a lacie d2 quadra hard drive that i ve been using on a mac computer for several years </s>
<s> the mac computer that the drive was connected to is pretty much dead held out for 8 years though </s>
<s> and i need to transfer the files from the hard drive to a pc computer </s>
<s> i can plug the drive into a mac and it just mounts on its own but nothing happens when i plug it into a pc </s>
<s> i read the manual and it says to format the drive as ntfs and it will appear in my computer folder </s>
<s> however i am worried that formatting the drive will erase everything on it and i will loose all my data </s>
<s> does anyone have any experience with this </s>
<s> i ve formatting smaller things like flash drives etc and i know that always erases the data so i d rather be sure about this before i do something stupid and erase every song and media file i ve ever owned any input would be great </s>
<s> copy your stuff out before formatting </s>
<s> and to share a little more i found booting a livecd no install </s>
<s> called ubuntu no learning linux </s>
<s> let me access such drives and copy content out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> glad i asked </s>
<s> so is there no way to use my drive on a mac and pc without erasing everything </s>
<s> my sister has a mac and i have a pc not for long hopefully </s>
<s> in my opinion too unreliable </s>
<s> today s apples can use ntfs </s>
<s> so when you get your files safe try ntfs next time </s>
<s> be safe </s>
