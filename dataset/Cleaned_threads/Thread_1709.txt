<s> can anyone help i am trying to find clear step by step instructions on how to re format my computer i am running xpprofessional on a pentium 111 256mg i have never done this before have read up on a few bits about it and tells you to make sure you back up everything and have all drivers before doing a re format as everything will be lost as far as drivers go are the drivers on the discs i have the only drivers i should have or do i need to download any others once i have backed up everything is there any other information i should ensure i get or do before hopefully finding out a step by sep precedure will be grateful for any advice david </s>
<s> what is a pentium 111 256mg </s>

<s> if nothing really special an xp instal disk should have what you will need </s>
<s> beyond that you can repartition your hd but there really isn t enough info in your post to give you any pointers on that </s>
<s> the more detailed information you can provide will determine the amount of good advice you will get </s>
<s> any particular reason for this re install </s>
<s> so you are currently running windows xp professional on a computer with a pentium iii processor cpu and 256mb of ram memory </s>
