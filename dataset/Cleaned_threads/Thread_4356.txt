<s> my dvd burner on my computer is a pioneer dvr 106a </s>
<s> the fastest for dvd r s is 4x </s>
<s> i m running winxp and using nero to burn it </s>
<s> i have used generic blank dvd r s in the past which works very well but i ran out so i got new ones which are memorex dvd r 16x </s>
<s> firmware for the burner has been updated </s>
<s> when i burn an dvd iso image onto the blank dvd r nero does it without errors </s>
<s> but when i look at the disc that i just burned through windows mycomputer drive it says it is a cd instead of a dvd and it has 0 free space 0 used space </s>
<s> my guess is my pioneer burner is too old to work with a 16x even though i thought a firmware upgrade would have fixed it but i dont want to throw 100 at a new burner if i dont have to </s>
<s> can anyone tell me what is wrong </s>
<s> maybe you are not in the states with newegg com or geeks </s>
<s> that drive sounds years old </s>
<s> i d go back to the media and firmware that worked </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> since you ve updated the firmware the next thing to check is your burning software </s>
<s> check your nero and update it if necessary </s>
<s> make sure that it isn t bumping into the native xp burning capabilities </s>
<s> when you check the drive in device manager is it showing up as a dvd </s>
<s> can you record other types of dvds to it fine or are you just having a problem with this one iso </s>
