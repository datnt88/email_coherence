<s> purchased a usb powered extension some time ago </s>
<s> did not try it immediately as i didn t need it </s>
<s> finally decided to try it and i get an error message stating quot usb device not recognized quot quot one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned quot </s>
<s> i have tried the cable on two laptops and two desktops operating systems ranging from the current windows 7 vista and windows xp </s>
<s> all with the same results </s>
<s> going into device manager on the xp system it tells my that there is an quot unknown device quot and that there are no drivers installed for it </s>
<s> did extensive research on the web and every where it says that no drivers are required for a powered usb cable </s>
<s> any suggestions or alternatives </s>
<s> have had the cable to long to return it so that is out </s>
<s> so all i can do is ask if there is a detail available like that </s>
<s> how long a cable is needed </s>
<s> it is a 5m standard usb powered cable </s>
<s> male connection on one end female on the powered end </s>
<s> no make or model </s>
<s> go get another one </s>
<s> i too see no drivers and there is nothing in your post that suggests it s your machines </s>
<s> me thinks that is what i will have to do </s>
<s> just got to figure out what i can do with 15 ft of usb cable </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and you would have to be perfect </s>
<s> i use a 10 foot extension cable and it is just wires </s>
<s> well a good gauge and twisted like the quot spec quot but it does work except for usb hard drives which we do expect to fail on such things </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> since the cable is powered pnp is trying to install drivers for the attached device </s>
<s> what device did you attach that failed to install or did you just leave it open ended </s>
<s> it fails when it is left open </s>
<s> i have tried it with a memory stick attached and got the same results </s>
