<s> note this is similar to iceman854l s problem </s>
<s> recently i purchased the lacie 1tb disk extreme </s>
<s> the problem is that my computer won t really recognize it </s>
<s> here s what happens when i turn on the hdd </s>
<s> it s connected to the computer through firewire 800 when i turn it on the computer vista os makes the sound that indicates a device has been plugged in or turned on but nothing else pops up </s>
<s> when i go to quot computer quot vista s quot my computer quot there s no sign of an external hdd </s>
<s> when i go to the device manager and look under disk drives the hdd is somehow listed in there so then i go to its properties and it says it s working properly that it is online and everything and it even shows how much space there is on the hdd but how the hell can i get in it </s>
<s> i ve tried uninstalling the driver then reinstalled </s>
<s> didn t work </s>
<s> i ve tried to unplug any other devices but my keyboard mouse </s>
<s> didn t work </s>
<s> tried to use usb </s>
<s> didn t make a difference </s>
<s> can anyone help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> that s not well supported even in vista </s>
<s> use these simple rules on connections </s>
<s> pc windows usb apple macos firewire pc linux your choice if you feel firewire should work please call microsoft </s>
<s> i see you tried usb and failed </s>
<s> at that point you have either not partitioned the drive and formatted those partitions or have a dead drive </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i use it for my digital camcorder when i record things to the computer </s>
<s> that works </s>
<s> i found a way to get this hdd formatted the thing is it freezes every time while formatting </s>
<s> this is an image of the formatting </s>
<s> note that i was doing this at almost 4 00am </s>
<s> i left it on all night and at the moment it is still at the same stage </s>
<s> nothing has changed </s>
<s> remember that people have brought me these firewire problems for years </s>
<s> no one shows me a working system </s>
<s> yes somewhere for some it does work </s>
<s> but when people tell me of trouble you will get my take on firewire </s>
<s> again it s either another firewire windows disaster or you have a defective drive </s>
<s> i read that you write formatting </s>
<s> tell me if you made the parttitions </s>
<s> if not remove then create them and try one more time </s>
<s> on xp i d suggest a quick format </s>
<s> same for vista if you can since formatting large drives can take a very very long time </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> would you be able to explain all that to me in bigger details </s>
<s> sorry i m just a noob when it comes to this stuff </s>
<s> so i was wonderng if you or anyone could explain me from the very start to finish how to do this whole formatting thing </s>
<s> but i try to never duplicate web content like how to partition in xp or vista </s>
<s> let s find some pages on that </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> the very first link is about how to use the vista partitioning tools </s>
<s> after i have removed the old partition i create it anew and format it quick mode if possible </s>
<s> again it does not matter if firewire works on your camcorder </s>
<s> try usb if you fail on the firewire link </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am using usb 2 0 now </s>
<s> lets see if this works </s>
<s> actually someone told me something different about formatting </s>
<s> this also reminded me on how i reformatted my first external hdd </s>
<s> i opened up the command prompt window typed in n fs ntfs yes suddenly it became n it used to be g and so far it s working </s>
<s> it takes time but it s 14 complete now almost 2 hours in the reformatting process </s>
<s> then scandisk or other tool later </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> after a long night it has finally formatted now it s finally displaying on my computer when it s on and i can go into it woot </s>
