<s> ribbon got broken almost immediate after printer mechanism gets moving </s>
<s> it doesn t even require to actually print anything to get ribbon broken </s>
<s> it s just enough to pull the paper towards and when both media and ribbon mechanism starts to rolling ribbon will rub off just above head starting from left to right </s>
<s> problem does not occur when i manually turn ribbon spindle instead of paper which also automatically makes paper spindle to move </s>
<s> in that scenario ribbon doesn t got broke </s>
<s> it must be some mechanical damage but i can t figure out what kind of </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> what no details other than zebra printer model </s>
<s> sometimes you have to observe operation and with a printer its easier than most </s>
<s> it probably has a cover sw that won t allow operation if open </s>
<s> if so then tape or somehow jam the sw down as if it were closed or if applicable put into service position </s>
<s> you can remove cover if not enough space to view operation </s>
<s> if you have a ribbon as you state then it s suppose to advance during operation to use new area of ribbon in order best print </s>
<s> either than sw or toggle is broken loose jammed or the logic that drives it is hosed </s>
<s> you have to figure out which </s>
<s> since this happens immediately during your power on that suggests its trying to take slack out of ribbon in order to be tight against printhd </s>
<s> or similar </s>
<s> again one of the above conditions applies </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks i ve solved the problem </s>
<s> it was preety simple i m just to noob to figure it out </s>
<s> ribbon was pressed to the far end on the roller and was rubbed by some parts of printer body </s>
<s> taking it back out on roller for about 3 5mm solved it </s>
<s> however if you put it back to far it will be missing ribbon sensor so that t not gonna work either </s>
<s> printer is zebra 170xiii plus </s>
<s> i hope that the ribbon was indeed intended for that model use </s>
<s> or the roller spindle isn t too worn or it s quot key quot to handle the roll is crisp and not worn </s>
<s> if this has been used for some extended time the wear tear could allow some slop as it were </s>
<s> these are pretty robust printers but users do tend to wear them out </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
