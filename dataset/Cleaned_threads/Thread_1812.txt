<s> anyone i am a very beginner </s>
<s> this is the first time </s>
<s> i am trying to install a 2nd drive with the old drive </s>
<s> the old drive is a western digital i think a 5 pin jumper selection </s>
<s> my new drive is maxtor </s>
<s> i ve been trying to find out the jumper settings for the old drive </s>
<s> there is one jumper on the old drive on 1 2 pins </s>
<s> i want to set the old drive to cs cable select </s>
<s> i really don t wish take the old drive out if i don t have to </s>
<s> all i have about the old drive is that it is 40gb ultra dma hd 5 pin by western digital </s>
<s> i don t understand much of the language or what they are talking about at western digital site </s>
<s> or anywhere else for that matter </s>
<s> i would appreciate any help anyone has to offer </s>
<s> thanks ron </s>
<s> and the drives should be set to all cable select which means the master and slave is determined by what connection you use </s>
<s> full details about this at bob </s>
<s> thank you for your reply but i still don t know how to set the jumper setting on the old drive western digital drive </s>
<s> maxtor did include the 80 conductor cable </s>
<s> they did tell me to set both drives to cs cable select </s>
<s> but where is cable select </s>
<s> their drive has a 5 pin selection </s>
<s> if i set to slave but i m afraid of data loss or whatever </s>
<s> with much appreciation ron stebbins </s>
<s> look either on the botom of the drive in line with the jumper pins or on a label attached to the hd </s>
<s> cable selec is usually csel but what ever they call it it will be apparent which you need </s>
<s> setting to wrong configuarion won t wipe your data but drievs will not be recognized if nit set correctly </s>
