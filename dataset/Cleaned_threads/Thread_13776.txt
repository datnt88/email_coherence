<s> hi recently i turned on my pc and found that it wont read the zip disk it had inserted </s>
<s> i tried to put another blank zip disk and still no recognition of having a disk inserted </s>
<s> i was told it may be because its dirty </s>
<s> i was told to get a zip cleaning disk but so far i havent seen one for sale </s>
<s> could you guys help me on this one </s>
<s> by the way i got a pc with windows me </s>
<s> thanks for any help provided </s>
<s> the zip drive s head never makes contact with the media </s>
<s> it flies above the media so cleaning is not the issue </s>
<s> try that media in another drive </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> most zip drives are approaching or have passed their designed lifespan </s>

<s> thanks for the advise </s>
<s> do u know if there is an new drive available that would read those disk </s>
<s> we used dozens and dozens at the office so when we suspect one we tried the media on another drive in the office </s>
<s> have a friend with a zip test the media for you </s>
<s> if need be decide to move off the zip </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the advice guess i will try to move my data off the disk and look for a new media </s>
<s> guess its time to get a cd burner </s>
