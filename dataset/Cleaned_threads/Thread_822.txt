<s> i just bought the buffalo linkstation live and have it installed with my 2wire router modem combo </s>
<s> when i copy a bunch of files to it windows tells me that i am writing at about 1 mb sec capital b </s>
<s> this isn t too bad and the read speed seems to be very good but my friend has a western digital nas that is doing 35 mb sec </s>
<s> anybody know where i should poke around to improve read write speed </s>
<s> i m connecting to it wirelessly but so was he thanks a ton brian </s>
<s> you need to check connection speeds but all the numbers you shared are possible </s>
<s> the 1mb speed was common in 802 11b days </s>
<s> i tested it with an ethernet cable and it writes at over 5 mb sec which makes me think that part of it is simply because wifi is slower but i also think that my router is slowing things down </s>
<s> still it works well </s>
<s> thanks brian </s>
