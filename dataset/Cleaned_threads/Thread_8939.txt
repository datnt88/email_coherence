<s> i have noticed that the audio cuts out randomly </s>
<s> i will be playing songs on winamp and all of a sudden when the next song comes up it doesn t play </s>
<s> if i hit the play button it doesn t move </s>
<s> all the audio then does not work for my computer until i shutdown and reboot </s>
<s> it is not just winamp either which i thought at first </s>
<s> if i use media player or another program or even if i am just surfing the web </s>
<s> i have checked the volume control and it is still set to high volume </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> note if you re asking for technical help please be sure to include all your system info including operating system model number and any other specifics related to the problem </s>
<s> also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums revealing personal information such as your e mail address telephone number and address is not recommended </s>
<s> i have a dell dimension 2400 xp home edition </s>
<s> i don t have anything altered to the default factory settings </s>
<s> the situation i described is all i know i have never been able to pin point the audio problem to a specific occurrence </s>
<s> i never have noticed after i do something it happens it just seems to occur every so often </s>
<s> would it be a driver for the os for audio </s>
<s> or a driver for winamp media player </s>
<s> another driver </s>
<s> many think they can use a pc as delivered without worry about drivers </s>
<s> this is sadly not true </s>
<s> since you revealed the make and model here are the 2 drivers i would install </s>
<s> but first if you used your service like this you would see what they offer </s>
<s> notice how some items are in the year 2007 </s>
<s> are you keeping up </s>
<s> see item 1 at since the dimension 2400 offered three different audio cards i can t offer which driver i d use until you tell me a bit more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have the same problem and the same machine </s>
