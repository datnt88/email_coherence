<s> i ve owned the dell dimension 4100 i am typing on since 2000 and had very few problems with it </s>
<s> i also understand the last few years have been a downward spiral for quality and customer service which used to be their strong suites </s>
<s> i need a new desktop and wondered if dell has pulled their heads out of their butts yet to keep other makers like hp from taking away their market share further </s>
<s> i m trying to take some of the current bad stuff written about dell with a grain of salt </s>
<s> i realize they sell a lot of computers so they re going to get a larger number of complaints but percentage of machines sold that are problems are more important than sheer numbers </s>
<s> besides unhappy people are more likely to post than satisfied ones </s>
<s> given the state of things here in june 2008 would anyone recommend an xps 420 </s>
<s> i understand they are supposed to have their own support division </s>
<s> the market has called for ever lower prices so this means support must transition to non humans and underpaid staffers </s>
<s> we also have windows itself to contend with as it s issues continue to this day </s>
<s> then is no panacea and nothing that appears to be changing this trend </s>
<s> but the hardware looks to be no better or worse than any other maker as i am surrounded by a few hundred dell laptops at the moment </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> there are periodically studies reports of repair rates </s>
<s> the last i read for desktops had hp compaq and acer gateway as top </s>
<s> they all flip flop and aren t all that far from each other </s>
<s> dell s pretty middle of the pack when it comes to quality </s>
<s> world wide they retain good marketshare </s>
<s> my problems with dell were more a symptom of being mail order getting doa computer and having to ship it back wasting a lot of time i didn t have </s>
<s> the xps 420 and others in that line impressed me as being pretty complete machines and a good value </s>
<s> you have to decide on any merits any oem maker has nowadays </s>
<s> it changes often and what maybe good to you could easily be offset by another user </s>
<s> the point being it really doesn t matter in the long run so read the fine print and have any problems act on them quickly and note them down </s>
<s> often you can do slightly better buying or doing diy project or have a 3rd party build one </s>
<s> the parts are generic enough across the board so buy what best fits your needs as for xps systems they are nothing more than warmed over basic systems </s>
<s> they offer nothing really special other than maybe support and the package deal </s>
<s> again 3rd party builders pretty much offer the system </s>
<s> if available in your area best buy fry s etc </s>
<s> offer oem type systems and at least if a problem crops up you can return to the store before the real oem warranty kicks in </s>
<s> heck even wal mart offers systems that have prices hard to beat and offer similar specs as well </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> when i started thinking about a new computer a year or so ago i thought of the diy route </s>
<s> i looked over a few tutorials and parts over at newegg </s>
<s> i think i could build one just fine my problem would be being my own tech support </s>
<s> the idea of syncing ram configuring a raid setup and a couple other things freaked me out a little too </s>
<s> i may drop into bb and see what they ve got </s>
<s> another route i thought of was costco which sells dell with i believe a 90 day no questions return policy </s>
<s> given the thread started with concerns about reliability and support diy is not a good topic to consider </s>
<s> if something goes wrong you re left troubleshooting and putting humpty dumpty together again </s>
<s> best buy has geek squad right there so they ll be able to help with stuff </s>
<s> i dunno if they have any xps 420 but i m sure they ve something comparable in dell or another brand </s>
<s> you won t even necessarily pay more than you would for diy </s>
<s> but the advantage of diy is you build it exactly the way you want it rather than settling for the configurations that are supplied in a store </s>
<s> my car needed its oil changed </s>
<s> i know how to change my oil and could have gone to an auto parts store </s>
<s> but instead i went to jiffy lube and got some reading done as they did the job in 1 4 of the time it d have taken me not to mention i garage saled my jackstands and all that junk years ago </s>
<s> sums this up well </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> i used to change the oil in my truck every 3000 then we bought a 4runner and my wife wanted to go to a jiffy lube type place so i thought what the heck one less vehicle to mess with </s>
<s> now with a 3 1 2 year old i love bringing the car into someplace and let someone else climb under the thing not to mention getting rid of the old oil </s>
<s> i digress point well taken </s>
<s> i just wondered at the beginning what people s experience has been with dell s quality of hardware and tech support if needed and i m sure with vista i ll need a little </s>
<s> were like in current terms not the awful stories i heard a year or more ago </s>
<s> i would probably enjoy a diy if i really had the time but when thiings go wrong is where i know i don t have the time nor expertise </s>
