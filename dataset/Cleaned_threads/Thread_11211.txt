<s> i recently had a home wireless network installed by a technician </s>
<s> it s a netgear router hooked to my dsl connection and has my dell desktop hardwired to it </s>
<s> i also have a dell inspiron 9300 laptop with a wifi card and that connects perfectly to the network </s>
<s> my problem is this </s>
<s> my son is visiting for a few weeks and is having trouble hooking his apple powerbook to the network </s>
<s> he can quot see quot the network named quot home quot but then he needs to enter a wep password to connect </s>
<s> i do not know what password the technician used so i can t give it to my son </s>
<s> unfortunately the technician is in south american for several months and i can t contact him </s>
<s> does anyone know how i can figure out what password was originally set up </s>
<s> i presume you are trying to connect to a router or access point to do this </s>
<s> if the tech did not change the default it s probably just quot admin quot without quotes </s>
<s> this is typical but should be contained in your documentation </s>
<s> generally you need to authenticate yourself by adding your mac address to a listing if mac filtering is used and enter the encription code </s>
<s> you can also reset everything and start over if need be </s>
<s> you don t want to be locked into the need for a technician to do this if you are paying him </s>
<s> another thing to do is google default password for your router some site has a huge list </s>
<s> try this to connect from the wired pc using the ip of the router if this doesn t do it reset the router and try to connect to it again from the wired computer </s>
<s> this should allow you to access the setup for the router and you can enter new passwords and keys </s>
<s> i say that tongue only partly in cheek it s the easy way out but very hard way back in </s>
<s> you could do a hard reset of the router read the documentation to find where the reset pin is and whether you need to hold it in for x seconds or do a simultaneous power on while dancing nude in the front yard or what and that will reset the router to factory defaults including wiping out all the current security settings </s>
<s> now you just set all new passwords and write them down in your documentation rather than leaving them solely in your tech s head </s>
<s> if you want to experiment a bit before doing a complete reset you might try logging into the router s configuration menu using the manufacturer s default configuration password in the hopes that your tech left the main configuration password as it was and only configured the wep password to something now unknown </s>
<s> if you can get into the main configuration page working from a computer that is wired to the router not from a wireless system just set a new wep passphrase to whatever you like </s>
<s> you will now have to reset that new wep key into your laptop so it can connect again but you will now know what to set your son s powerbook to </s>
<s> to learn the factory default login to the configuration page read the documentation or go to the website of the manufacturer and download a copy of it from their support page </s>
<s> dw </s>
