<s> given all the hoopla about wifi problems and gps problems and availability problems and the fact that i am not a gamer nor will i watch movies on it would i be happy with the old transformer vs the prime </s>
<s> i am one that likes the latest tech but not a show stopper </s>
<s> is the above listed issues really a big deal or are they being blown out of proportion </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> here s the gps quot problems quot i ve read </s>
<s> both are limitations of gps technology but new to gps users may not know about the limitation and write these are glaring defects </s>
<s> 1 on power up can take many minutes to lock onto satellites </s>
<s> 2 doesn t work indoors or in parking garages </s>
<s> is that the problems </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t know what the gps problems are i don t have one </s>
<s> i read the metal case is limiting the range of both the gps and wifi </s>
<s> my question is is this a real concern that makes this tablet less desirable than others </s>
<s> because i know the gps issues </s>
<s> something about working with gps tracking helps me here but as to the wifi that s odd too </s>
<s> i found no two devices to give the same range </s>
<s> some would call that a defect </s>
<s> again i m back to writing about limitation or differences </s>
<s> the biggest problem i see folk encounter is when they try to replace their laptop with an android or other pad </s>
<s> they learn first hand what s up </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> not trying to replace a laptop </s>
<s> just trying to buy a really good tablet </s>
<s> i think i hear you saying the prime is the way to go </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> just like a pc as we increase the cpu and more what more does angry birds need to run </s>
<s> what apps did you run before that you need more oomph </s>
<s> and right around the corner is windows 8 and bluestacks </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> as we passed some ghz and cores you have to ask what apps are in need of that quad core tablet </s>
<s> it is very nice but my advice is to wait till the dust settles from ces </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> as we look six months to a year into the future don t you think the quad core will trigger some pretty cool stuff </s>
<s> why overpay for this today </s>
<s> so at the same price as an ipad2 you feel it is too high now </s>
<s> you are right it will probably come down at least some </s>
<s> you never revealed the use for this pad </s>
<s> i m watching folk rush in and learn the lessons the hard way about apps and more </s>
<s> if you are jazzed about all this don t buy until you can get past the jazz </s>
<s> as to your comment about if this will bring out this or that let me comment about ice cream </s>
<s> some folk are waiting for that but developers i know won t use its new features because most folk are not that yet </s>
<s> they seem to be in agreement that in 6 months or a year they might have an ice cream feature app </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will use it to compose docs spreadsheets etc for work check email share pictures surf web and use some basic apps at first </s>
<s> it will be my first tablet but i also want it to be worthy of time from a techno point of view </s>
<s> don t want to be buying or wanting to buy another one in 6 months </s>
<s> prime is priced the same as the ipad2 </s>
<s> i did not mention the ipad </s>
<s> please do yourself a favor and try to do what you wrote on any android tablet today </s>
<s> that use is exactly what i m finding folk upset about </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> a couple reasons i and looking strong at asus transformers both old and prime is the dock and polaris software </s>
<s> when they think they are going to produce word and such documents this is where folk are getting upset </s>
<s> my advice is to not buy this system for that use today </s>
<s> or if you do don t spend so much you don t have the bucks for a laptop </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have a laptop and polaris is compatible with microsoft office the tablet will not be used as my only office tool </s>
<s> will use it that way mainly when i m away from home office </s>
<s> be sure you can get your money back </s>
<s> at nearly 500 bucks over </s>
<s> you are inching towards ultrabook prices </s>
<s> thanks for all your advice </s>
