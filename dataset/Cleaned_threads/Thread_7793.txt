<s> i purchased a dell studio 1555 laptop with windows vista home premium sp1 in october </s>
<s> after few days whenever i hibernated the system it automatically booted up after 1 or 2 hrs </s>
<s> when i called the dell support for help they told that this is occuring because of hard disk failure and they will replace the hard disk </s>
<s> the present hard disk contains the factory created system image which i want to migrate to my new hard disk but i have no idea on how to do that </s>
<s> i tried using the windows backup and resstore utility but it didn t helped as it was not backing up some of the vital files </s>
<s> please help as soon as possible as the dell technician to replace the hard disk will be coming in 3 4 days </s>
<s> i d remove it and put it into an external enclosure with a usb connection and collect data that way </s>
<s> unreadable areas of that hard drive are going to create problems for some backup software </s>
<s> you do this manually </s>
<s> i d also think that if he technician is going to replace the hard drive he s also going to recreate the recovery partition during the restore process </s>
<s> hidden partitions are something that regular backup utilities don t deal with </s>
<s> some imaging cloning software will but they may halt on read errors </s>
<s> get what you can manually </s>
<s> no the technician will take away the old hard disk </s>
<s> the manual copying is not working </s>
<s> i tried and tested it by installing vista on vmware </s>
<s> that s what i meant </s>
<s> if something is corrupt in the os or some of its components you can t use this method </s>
<s> you get a working machine to do that </s>
<s> i haven t used an external drive as i am not having one </s>
<s> i tried the windows backup and restored it on the virtual machine but it didn t worked as all the files were not copied by the backup </s>
<s> then i manually copied all the files and tried it </s>
<s> this one also doesn t worked </s>
<s> when i executed the recovery application it gave error quot access to file denied quot </s>
<s> so i edited the permissions and restarted the application and this time it stopped responding </s>
