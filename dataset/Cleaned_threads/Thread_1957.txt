<s> ok i have a dell e520 series </s>
<s> long story short my old pc died and had to use my student loan money and had to order from dell or hp </s>
<s> ok so i have 2 8ghz intel core 2 duo 256mb xfx 8600gts added 3gb of ram added windows vista home premium 32bit and the crappy mobo they give you is basically bottle necking my proformance so i want to upgrade my mobo but to do that i need to get a new cpu fan psu and case because dell make everything just for there parts </s>
<s> well none of that is the issue my issue is if i get a new motherboard and plug in the hard drive i am using right now will my current vista system work </s>
<s> will the vista reinstallation dvd that came with the system work </s>
<s> ive herd so many un sure and mixed answers that i want to be 100 sure before i spend money on these parts </s>
<s> still a maybe </s>
<s> it shouldn t work since the license is only for the dell but you read that some succeed </s>
<s> dell s answer should be quot no quot as to the bottleneck the only one i see is the 8600 card </s>
<s> gamers usually go for the 8800 bob </s>
<s> well im not looking to play crysis and i dont have any need for an 8800 yet </s>
<s> but the memory speed and pcie speed on my motherboard are so bad that i cant hit any benchmarks that my computer should be able to hit </s>
<s> i called dell and the guy i talked to said it would work but the people they have working there arnt the brightest in the world </s>
<s> if you get a different brand of motherboard your current windows won t load so re intalling windows is a must </s>
<s> i have tried to use the xp installation that comes with dell on my other pc but the cd s protection didn t allow me to do it </s>
<s> on another note keep in mind that a lot of these installation disks that come with dell sony or toshiba computers are not actual windows instalation disks they are image disks </s>
<s> so they probably almost certain won t work on your new mobo </s>
<s> the kind of control that you want to have over the different parts in your pc is not easy to accomplish when you are working with a quot package quot pc built by dell or any other manufacturer </s>
<s> thank you so much your are the first person to answer my question </s>
<s> you want to upgrade your mtrbd thus that tells me you want to keep the mtrbd if not then you replace the mtrbd </s>
<s> you will have problems </s>
<s> as the other poster mentioned you will need a new os install cd as most oem type cds provide install only for the system or brand they were sold under </s>
<s> while you can swap much of the old system h w to a new mtrbd </s>
<s> you re stuck getting the drivers when the new os has been installed </s>
<s> vista being a pita if you stay with it may not have vista available drivers from their vendors once you correctly id the proper drivers needed </s>
<s> if you stay with the old mtrb </s>
<s> and the whole purpose was to reduce or remove bottleneck then really what was the point if you blame the mtrbd </s>
<s> as the bottleneck fault </s>
<s> be sure to check dell s support website for any bios updates that may address some issues and if they apply to you then you need them </s>
<s> hopefull that may address yopur bottleneck issue </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
