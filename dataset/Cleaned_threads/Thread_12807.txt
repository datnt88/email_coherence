<s> i know you cannot upgrade xp x32 to vista 64 while xp is installed </s>
<s> but i know that vista upon a fresh install off of an upgrade disk will only ask you to insert a disk from a previous os to prove you are quot upgrading quot </s>
<s> will that work if i am installing vista x64 and insert xp x32 for the proof of an upgrade </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> well it looks like they do not make an upgrade version of x64 </s>
<s> you just need to get the x64 dvd </s>
<s> if you know someone with the x64 dvd use their s but enter your vista license key </s>
<s> the x64 dvd is included with ultimate </s>
