<s> if you have one or more devices connected to your monitor you can switch between the vga and dvi input signals </s>
<s> to switch between the vga and dvi input signals follow the steps below on the lower bezel of your monitor press the menu button to enter the onscreen menu </s>
<s> use the arrow buttons to navigate to the image icon and press the menu button to enter the submenu </s>
<s> select the input signal and press the menu button to confirm </s>
<s> use the arrow buttons to navigate to the exit icon and then press the menu button to save and exit </s>
<s> quot there is a graphic icon there i can t put in this forum </s>

<s> i followed the steps listed and when i try to enter the submenu under image by pressing menu nothing happens </s>
<s> this is what i see in the submenu 1680x1050 h 64khz v 60hz digital input then my s n i even tried switching the digital input to analog which did nothing </s>
<s> i am left to guess that someone used a dvi to vga adapter </s>

<s> ok so my last reply was actually false </s>
<s> i was under the wrong option </s>
