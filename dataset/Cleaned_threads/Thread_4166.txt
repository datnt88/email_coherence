<s> i have an rca cable modem time warner and a netgear router which work flawlessly when i have the wifi disabled </s>
<s> in this configuration i have two computers wired to it one mac one pc running windows xp </s>
<s> i ve been running this connection for over a year without any problems </s>
<s> recently i attempted to enable the wifi but the modem and router would crash after a few minutes </s>
<s> i was able to isolate the problem as being related to the pc at least i think so </s>
<s> i discovered that with the wifi enabled and only the mac connected the system will work fine </s>
<s> but when i connect the pc the modem router will crash again </s>
<s> i am restarting everything in order modem router computers </s>
<s> one thing i noticed it that when the pc is turned off and the network cable is plugged into the router the port light is on </s>
<s> not sure if this has anything to do with it but it seems to be the only unusual thing i ve noticed </s>
<s> any help is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> why didn t you share the router s model number </s>
<s> maybe all you wanted to read was to go get a new router </s>

<s> the sarcasm isn t necessary </s>
<s> notice i didn t indicate the model number of the modem either </s>
<s> maybe that implies i just want to hear quot get a new modem quot </s>
<s> for others reading this who may be able to offer helpful advice the model number is wgr614v7 </s>
<s> i m left to guess what your goals are when you post without the pertinent details </s>
<s> no sarcasm was intended but i tend to lay it out plainly since some need to hear read quot get a new router quot gt the 614s are well known to me </s>
<s> here s what i find works </s>
<s> 1 use their latest firmware </s>
<s> 2 use the default settings </s>
<s> then </s>
<s> 3 use wpa for the security </s>
<s> do not deploy with wep mac filters etc </s>
<s> stick to the basic 3 items i listed </s>
<s> consider locking the wifi to just 802 11g since the mixed b g mode is known to be less stable </s>
<s> in closing do not run any torrents over wifi </s>
<s> good luck </s>
