<s> i bought an alienware area 51 a little bit more then a month ago </s>
<s> when i put it into sleep mode it starts again after a minute or two </s>
<s> some times it just starts a second after it goes to sleep </s>
<s> thats very frustrating since i use the sleep mode a lot </s>
<s> im running a norwegian windows 7 professional can that be a problem </s>
<s> did you call it in </s>
<s> the reason i ask is many wait till it s out of warranty and then flame about this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> can that be a problem </s>
<s> only if you can t understand norwegian </s>
<s> did you go to the power settings through the control panel </s>
<s> no i havnt but i can try that </s>
<s> i dont know if the w7 is the problem </s>
<s> it shouldnt be right </s>
<s> yeah i tried going to power settings but dont know what i should do there </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> who installed windows 7 </s>
<s> home users usually are blissfully unaware that we can t install windows without hunting for the install plan for this machine </s>
<s> i do not have the install plan for this machine dell or alienware has it but here s my generic install plan with added note for windows xp </s>
<s> 1 install the os </s>
<s> 2 install the motherboard chipset driver </s>
<s> 3 if xp and required install msuaa see google 4 install the audio driver </s>
<s> 5 install the video driver </s>
<s> 6 install lan wifi drivers </s>
<s> 7 if a dell may required the quickset software </s>
<s> 8 install protection suite </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> dell alienware installed everything for me </s>
<s> it came with w7 </s>
<s> i just wanted to be sure it was not caused by us </s>
<s> my alienware use to go to sleep if it was on for an extended amount of time with no problem but now it will not sleep on it s own and when i try to manually make it sleep it will turn the monitor off and then immediately turn the entire system back on </s>
<s> i tried to power down using the power button when this kept happening which also wouldn t work so i then pulled out the power cord </s>
<s> i waited about ten seconds and put the cord back in </s>
<s> i did not press any buttons and my alienware turned it s self on right as the power was restored and came out of sleep skipping the loading screen and going directly to my desktop reviewing my notepad documents that i had open before previously taking the power cord out </s>
<s> seems like alienware has some sleep issues or the systems are possessed </s>
