<s> windows xp recently the cdrom floppydrive and cdr stopped working properly </s>
<s> when i insert a cd and try to open it i get this error message d or a is not accessible </s>
<s> incorrect function </s>
<s> but if i restart the computer and leave the disc in the drive after restarting it will read the disc properly </s>
<s> for some reason the disc needs to be in the computer when it boots up for it to recognize it </s>
<s> i was going to reinstall the drivers but this wouldnt make sense considering it s the three different devices doing the same thing </s>
<s> the only thing differently ive done to the computer lately is i installed a usb smartmedia card reader which said it was not tested to run with xp i installed anyway and it worked at first then it would not and so i removed it </s>
<s> but my usb mouse still functions properly so i doubt this is the cause </s>
<s> i also got the service pack2 to from microsoft to update windows xp </s>
<s> and i got new antivirus software as well as adaware and spysubtract </s>
<s> these shouldnt have an effect but theyre the only things ive done differently on the computer recently any help would be great i dont know too much but am learning through each new problem and just need some direction as to what things to check out </s>
<s> select start run and type msconfig go the startup tab and uncheck any items related to anti virus spyware or adware </s>
<s> in fact try removing any software that you recognize in the list that isn t part of windows itself </s>
<s> reboot and see if that resolves the problem if it does you can restore the items a few at a time until the problem occurs again and you can narrow down the cause </s>
<s> i have either installed or had clients install sp2 on a few hundred systems and not run into the problem even similar to what you describe </s>
<s> system works or av or nis which have all been noted to cause this error message </s>
<s> in a few instances avg and mcaffee have also been noted as culprits </s>
<s> go here and search for not accessible </s>
<s> incorrect function </s>
<s> with the quot all knowledgebases quot radio button checked </s>
<s> so too has roxio and nero s incd also you might try this right click on the drive w the problem properties recording tab and then check the quot enable cd recording on this drive quot box </s>
<s> just opposite of what is recommended for dvd </s>
<s> you were right it s norton but their instructions to fix it dont seem accurate change the service startup timing to change the startup timing 1 start symantec antivirus </s>
<s> 2 on the configure menu click filesystem auto protect </s>
<s> 3 in the right pane click advanced </s>
<s> 4 under startup options select symantec antivirus start </s>
<s> 5 click ok until you see filesystem auto protect and thenclick exit </s>
<s> 6 restart the computer </s>
<s> when i open the antivirus software there s no configure option but if i go to options it has the filesystem auto protect </s>
<s> and the advanced button is not in the right pane but is a drop down menu below filesystem auto protect </s>
<s> and then after that there is no startup options or any of the other stuff they say is there </s>
<s> it only says what activates to monitor when using floppy and then has two options 1 scan all removable media for boot viruses every time it is mounted 2 scan floppy disk in a for boot viruses when shutting down am i not looking in the right configuration area it s definately not the same as they are describing is there somewhere deeper in the program i need to go </s>
<s> iwould have emailed norton with this next issue but they make you work to find an email address on their site </s>
<s> thank you so much for all your help almost there </s>
