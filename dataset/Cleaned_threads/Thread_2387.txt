<s> i have a new computer with os windows xp home edition i m trying to install my old hard drive os win 98 se so i can swap files the bios recognize and the disk management of xp show the disk and says it is active and quot healthy quot but it does nt show on my pc or any other place </s>
<s> what can i do </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> so it does not show in my computer </s>
<s> not sure why it shows in disk mgt if this problem but in your original computer it was probably the master and yuu re now using it as a slave </s>
<s> the new one is probably using cable select and the new 80 conductor cable so try setting the jumper on the old drive to cable select and connect to the grey gray </s>
<s> connector on the primary ide ribbon cable </s>
<s> just a wag </s>
<s> this is quite frequently caused by using a 3rd party partitioning program to allow large drives to be recognized by older computers </s>
<s> if you used disk manager or ez drive to partition the drive then you need to run that software to get the data recognized </s>
<s> best bet in those cases is to network the old drive from the original system to the new one and copy the files over the network </s>
<s> then wipe the drive out completely repartition if you want to use it with xp </s>
<s> okay my dad had a similar problem </s>
<s> the hd has to be in ntfs format not fat for windows xp to recognize it </s>
<s> you also have to install the latest drivers for your particular hard drive which was his problem </s>
<s> once you do that you should be able to restart your computer and the hard drive should be recognized </s>
<s> i assume then you can delete windows 98 se if you haven t already from your computer </s>
<s> better than even chance that old drive has ddo installed on it </s>
<s> networking will be the only way to recover the files </s>
