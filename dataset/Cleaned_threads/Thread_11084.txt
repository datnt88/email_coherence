<s> having problems with both cdrw and dvd </s>
<s> windows sees the drives in quot my computer quot but is having problem reading data or even recognizing that a cd is in the drive </s>
<s> was trying to burn a cd today and got a message that an error was received from the quot output device quot the cdrw with the suggestion to check that the drive is installed </s>
<s> does this mean to check the cables like i saw recommended in another post </s>
<s> i would think that if a cable is loose or disconnected that the drive wouldn t even be recognized </s>
<s> i was able to reboot once and the drive recognized data on a cd but would not burn a cd </s>
<s> will also do some housecleaning inside </s>
<s> thanks patti </s>
<s> where s the first question </s>
<s> there is an ongoing discussion with what looks to be a failed mad dog dvd cdrw drive </s>
<s> the owner appears to be in denial about it but do read that discussion to see what to try </s>
<s> here s the discussion so you can save yourself from the same dialogue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this was my first question </s>
<s> i was referring to a couple of other posts regarding cd dvd in this forum </s>
<s> sorry if i mislead you </s>
<s> thanks for the link to other question answers </s>
<s> it did answer one of my questions about jumpers </s>
<s> i ll try the housekeeping routine first and a cd cleaner </s>
<s> this isn t my pc </s>
<s> i was helping a friend and i know she doesn t have the extra money to buy a new cd burner right now so was hoping there might be some other suggestions </s>
<s> thanks patti </s>
<s> some get bulk cdrs and run into a bad batch </s>
<s> for instance i get a bad batch and the cdr needed help since the atip information called the cdr 40x but the speed was really 16x </s>
<s> nero allowed me to set the record speed to 16x and the cdr was usable </s>
<s> i felt this was ok for me but not for others </s>
<s> if you want to know about atip and more type cdr faq into google com bob </s>
