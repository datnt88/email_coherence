<s> hi i want to buy a wireless laser mouse </s>
<s> i ve researched a lot on various mices but logtiech s g7 gaming mouse and the mx610 laser mouse catch my interest </s>
<s> onto my question </s>
<s> i ve seen on the mx610 there are two buttons near the thumb area for going back and forward while browsing the internet </s>
<s> i had an hp mouse with similar buttons but they always accounted for accidental clicks </s>
<s> and i would end up way too back or forward while browsing </s>
<s> does this happen with the mx610 also </s>
<s> please let me know thanks in advance </s>
<s> these do work very well </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> they work very well but what about the accidental clicks </s>
<s> are they positioned such that u ll press these buttons by ur thumb without inteding to </s>
<s> that happens on hp mice </s>
<s> it is the nortek office 200wd had a power rating of 5volts 100milliamps </s>
<s> it is quite power hungry and sometimes not a lot but sometimes doesn t get enough power from the usb ports and either cuts out for a second or slows down </s>
<s> but this is very rare </s>
<s> so i would advise you to look for this in mice too and make sure you have enough power in your usb ports </s>
<s> as for its thumb buttons it has the two for back and forward browser and great for games too and i never catch them by accident </s>
<s> both buttons are on the same side where you d put your thumb </s>
<s> unfortunately not very good for left handed people though </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> when i click it clicks when i don t it doesn t </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for ur replies just one more question is mx610 good enough for gaming </s>
<s> i m not a hardcore gamer i just play games once in a while </s>
<s> so i want a mouse to work normally as well as good enough in games </s>
