<s> issue samsung ide hdd 250gb is spinning but the needle keeps going to the middle and back over and over again i took it apart to see what could be wrong but it s not mounting on any pc </s>
<s> i used a double usb gt micro usb cable </s>
<s> so it does have sufficient power </s>
<s> the hdd is normally in a casing which dropped yesterday and is probably causing the issue does anyone have ay idea if i can make it work again and what is causing the issue if anyone is interested i can upload a movie of the spinning hdd tonight so people can see what i mean </s>
<s> ty in advance </s>
<s> too many and none of them apply to home repair </s>
<s> this is one you send to this is not to sound cruel but the issue is well known you could research it but if you ask that means you can t recover this hard drive </s>
<s> sorry i can t blunt this any further </s>
<s> if you had the tools and skills you wouldn t be asking </s>

<s> after investigating the hdd i took apart it seems the hdd reading pins or whatever they are called are slightly bent </s>
<s> i m going to try and get myself a old similar hdd and put the hard disk in that one to see if it can still read my data </s>
<s> and you re right if i had the tools and the skills got skills but not much on hardware i wouldn t be asking </s>
<s> but that s what forums are for right </s>
<s> be sure you pay little or nothing as that no longer works in modern drives </s>
<s> the reasons are out there on the net </s>
<s> forums are for asking such questions </s>
<s> if someone asks one that shows they are not ready or didn t do the research then you might get a reply like mine </s>
<s> i try to blunt the force or impact but sometimes i fail </s>
<s> if you want your data back i strongly suggest you let drivesavers com do the work </s>
