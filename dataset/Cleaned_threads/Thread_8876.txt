<s> i want to revive an old pc based on an asus a7v266 e motherboard </s>
<s> the only part missing is a video card i have a pci card but i would rather use an agp one </s>
<s> my motherboard accepts up to 4x agp video cards </s>
<s> although i found many of them they are generally more expensive than 8x cards and also have less video memory </s>
<s> i also found that some 8x cards are backward compatible with 4x slots some are even compatible with 2x slots </s>
<s> i would like to know if all 8x agp video cards are backwards compatible with 4x </s>
<s> i really would appreciate any input and or suggestions </s>
<s> dimitri </s>
<s> i have yet to fit an 8x only card </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> just make sure the agp card you choose install is based on 1 5v </s>
<s> older agp cards were 3 0v </s>
