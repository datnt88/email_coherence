<s> for all my attempts i haven t been able to create a 3 monitor setup </s>
<s> i m running windows xp pro </s>
<s> and i ve got two graphic cards installed in my tower ati radeon hd 3650 agp and ati radeon 9250 pci </s>
<s> both of the ati variety </s>
<s> my assessment of the issue from what i ve seen is that for some reason the drivers for both of my graphics cards can t be installed at the same time </s>
<s> some sort of conflict </s>
<s> i can get each card s drivers installed and working great so i know both cards do work </s>
<s> however soon as i install the drivers for the second card i get a blue screen and have to roll back to a system restore point </s>
<s> i m sure i have the correct drivers for each card </s>
<s> i ve even tried manually installing drivers </s>
<s> i ve used driver sweeper after each failed attempt to wipe the slate clean and try again </s>
<s> but no go </s>
<s> one of the things i run into is when i have the pci s drivers installed and restart and proceed to install the agp s i get asked if i want to replace system32 s quot ati2evxx exe quot and quot ati2evxx dll quot files with the two new ones from the source install </s>
<s> it would also say that they are different versions of english i e </s>
<s> one on my computer already is quot english candida quot while the other is quot english american quot don t know if this is the root of the conflict between the drivers </s>
<s> does anyone have any pointers that will get all these monitors jiving </s>
<s> i know believe i m almost there </s>
<s> i m assuming that if i can get over this hurdle of non coexisting drivers i d be on my way to three monitor heaven </s>
<s> thanks spari </s>
<s> if anyone has any ideas i would really appreciate the help </s>
<s> i wrestled with similar cards a few years ago </s>
<s> i finally changed the cards out to the other camp and it worked </s>
<s> i am not going to tell you these setups always work but the lesson i learned is if it s for the office i mandate we get the quad output card </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it probably would be a problem solved if i changed my graphics cards to two more modern ones that were somewhat guaranteed to work together to create a three monitor setup </s>
<s> i wish i could </s>
<s> i m positive that there is a specific answer to the specific problem i m facing with these ati cards </s>
<s> that said i appreciate your input </s>
<s> it s the suspect in my book </s>
<s> i know that you wish that someone would tell you to run driver version 10 2 but no one seems to know that </s>
<s> i d change that older card for anything else </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i d hate to spend money on this idea </s>
<s> it isn t as cool a thing when you can just throw money at a problem </s>
<s> sometimes it sucks all the creativity out of finding a solution </s>
<s> that said i ve been thinking that it may be a good idea to pick up a late model dual video pci card and add that to my system along side the dual dvi agp card </s>
<s> if that doesn t work i ll return the new pci card to the store and forget i ever hatched this tri monitor egg </s>
