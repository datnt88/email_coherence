<s> let me start by saying i am very much a novice pc user and i would to thank you for your help in advance </s>
<s> that being said i have two computers a and b with a being wired to my router and b being wireless </s>
<s> a is running xp pro and b is running xp media center </s>
<s> i am also running a program called network magic that helps in sharing folders and such </s>
<s> computer a has a folder containing all of my mp3 files that i would like to put on computer b and i set it up to be shared using network magic </s>
<s> when i open up the program i can open the folder but i can not play any of the files contained in the folder and i can not drag them to a folder on computer b nor can i copy and paste them to the folder on computer b when i attempt to i get an error saying quot cannot copy lt filename gt access is denied </s>
<s> make sure the disk is not full or write protected and that the file is not currently in use quot does anyone have any suggestions on what to do on how to get these files from computer a to computer b sorry for the lengthy description and again thank you for your time </s>
<s> 1 let s say your account on computer a is called quot johnny quot </s>
<s> do you have an account called quot johnny quot on computer b and did you set the permissions on the files to allow johnny to read them </s>
<s> that s 2 things you need to accomplish </s>
<s> 2 another downright nutty thing that kills some is that after they get the accounts correct it still doesn t work </s>
<s> what i found is windows doesn t retroactively give johnny access to the share </s>
<s> i have to remove the share recreate it after i created johnny s account </s>
<s> after this johnny can read </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> again sorry for my lack of knowledge but how would i go about doing that </s>
<s> i apologize but i really need you to hold my hand through this process </s>
<s> with all the fine books and web pages about the sharing properties in windows i must decline giving any step by step </s>
<s> my goal was to share why this happens most of the time </s>
<s> creating accounts should be easy </s>
