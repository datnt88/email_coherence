<s> i have a hard drive out of a dell inspiron mini1012 that has the original o s win7 and all factory info on it replaced it with a ssd and did a fresh install of win7 </s>
<s> is it possible to put this drive in a dell dimension that i have upgraded with a decent graphics card sound card 3gb ram new 3 06gb northwoodht processor and am running windows 8 consumer preview on </s>
<s> i have the original dell install discs and all </s>
<s> i also have acronis true image that i can back up with </s>
<s> i see that i don t have anything to lose to try but would like to have some input on proper procedure technique if possible </s>
<s> i can always put the old drive back in if it doesn t work </s>
<s> also i have a ide to sata conversion board so hopefully the new drive will be recognized </s>
<s> i should also mention that i no longer have the inspiron mini which may be an issue if info from it is needed </s>
<s> there is not all the details here but many machines had a sata port so i d look for that use it and skip the adapter </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> would the port be located on the motherboard </s>
<s> it is a 2y832 </s>
<s> i ve had this thing apart several times and don t recall seeing a sata cable but if i could plug in to the motherboard i ll do that and save the converter for something else </s>
<s> also can i use the cable from the old cd player </s>
<s> i believe it is sata and does nt work anyway </s>
<s> in doing this how would i change setup </s>
<s> you re asking some pretty basic questions and you should be careful in at least the application of your new found knowledge </s>
<s> let s be clear if the hd you plan to install uses the same type of connection from old to new pc then you simply connect properly </s>
<s> if not and you need some converter then attach and connect again properly instruction provided </s>
<s> etc next if you plan to use the hd quot as is quot with the current os present from old pc to new that s not going to work under typical os restrictions and it was intended that way </s>
<s> you can possibility reload the os and have a go at it and see where that gets you </s>
<s> if your version of the os is non oem and some retail upgrade version it should work but full details on that side aren t provided </s>
<s> on top of this i see win8 in the mix are you planning to install that on your mix of parts </s>
<s> overall it seems you got the items needed to proceed so as you say quot i don t have anything to lose to try quot and as long proper connections etc </s>
<s> are done you try it all </s>
<s> alas if there is call for os key located on sticker then you need that as well have access to that </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i went to google and put in dimension 4600 the first hit was the documentation </s>
<s> i clicked on that and saw i o ports then clicked on that to land at hmm right there it tells you quot serial ata two 7 pin connectors quot sorry if this upsets you in any way but you have the connections for new and old drives </s>
<s> there is no issue there </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i was actually going to research this myself when i get off work </s>
