<s> i m getting a new computer and use it mostly for music recording acid or the like and video editing short teaching vids with sony vegas as well as general internet use downloading </s>
<s> no gaming </s>
<s> will this setup be ok </s>
<s> i m a massive user of computers but for some reason know nothing about what s inside one </s>
<s> here s what i have written up by the dude who s building it cpu intel q8300 2 5 ram samsung 2g 6200 2 of these motherboard asus p5q se2 vga ati hd 4670 hdd samsung 1tb odd lg h22ns 30 case able a201 power supply aone 500w monitor esys ex2201w some of this stuff i m not even sure about what it is but i do know that it s got a ton of space on the hard drive and it seems pretty fast </s>
<s> so far the bill s 975 won </s>
<s> does that seem about right </s>
<s> i ll also be getting a nice soundcard for recording though i m not sure what kind just yet any recommendations </s>
<s> by the way i m in seoul korea so that s why i m using asian products </s>
<s> i trust samsung not sure about the other brands </s>
<s> cpu architecture and name have nothing in common </s>
<s> amd64 is the same x86_64 no matter who makes it </s>
<s> ram this depends on the board manufacturer and bios </s>
<s> again name doesn t matter </s>
<s> graphics card support is also dependent upon the library being used </s>
<s> i am a user of computers and of multiple operating systems </s>
<s> glorified specs and the hype behind them are useless to me </s>
<s> really you should learn about computers </s>
<s> it would be very easy for someone to screw you in a way you won t enjoy </s>
<s> fast </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> you need experience with other operating systems and variating configurations for each before you make this statement </s>
<s> buying asian parts is practically a mute point as most computer parts are from the pacific rim area </s>
<s> just buy what you feel comfortable with and best warranty if any </s>
<s> your system looks very capable i see nothing that stands out as an issue from the h w </s>
<s> don t count on speed as a system measure its more of the guts that can crunch all this in a reasonable time </s>
<s> however you need to consider the os you didn t mention thus a 64 bit one is better for you as you re using video or audio editing etc into the mix </s>
<s> xp or vista 64 bit is probably a good choice and you can add more ram should the need arise </s>
<s> i don t like to give advice on specs of an system has usually that s a done deal </s>
<s> i part is suggesting quot cheap is cheap quot so don t buy on cost alone you ll be happier in the long run </s>
<s> adios willy </s>
<s> first thing i see power supply would jack it up a little 500w is less than i would go 600w or better </s>
<s> probably you may want to keep a look out for a good sound card for audio and a dedicated card will take the processing load off the main procesor but if for basic audio asus in built is just fine </s>
<s> with regards to samsung they are one of the small number of memory chip manufacturer for most other brands besides hynix for crucial kingston and patriot thus that s not an issue </s>
