<s> so i am on a somewhat tight budget and am looking for a projector costing around 500 it will be mostly used for movie watching and occasional gaming </s>
<s> i would of course like it to be hd at least 720p but i understand it may be a stretch for the price </s>
<s> perhaps you know of some sort of sale or clearance with the whole black friday or cybermonday ordeal any help is appreciated thanks </s>
<s> hard to find for that price look at optima or epson they both make decent reasonably priced units </s>
<s> 1 portability 2 big projection otherwise i preferred a regular tv </s>
<s> the bad part about projectors are the good one are very expensive also the great screens are also very expensive and i don t think 500 budget will do </s>
<s> of course a white wall would do but crappie </s>
<s> personally i probably look for a 32 quot 40 quot tv instead </s>
<s> what your reason s for the projector </s>
<s> portability is the main reason why i would prefer a projector over a large tv i just thought that since its the thanksgiving weekend and cybermonday is coming up there might be some sales that would bring a decent projector down to my price line </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
