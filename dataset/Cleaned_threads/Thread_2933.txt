<s> suddenly my bios stopped working </s>
<s> it will let me into the boot menu but not the bios </s>
<s> has anyone experienced this problem </s>
<s> how can i fix it </s>
<s> to help much check the info you should give when posting for help </s>
<s> i think i have an energy star bios because whenever the information screen pops up you can see the logo but it stays there for less then a second so i can t read the rest of it </s>
<s> the problem is i can t get into the bios </s>
<s> it says press lt f1 gt for setup and it won t let me in </s>
<s> i have tried other common buttons delete esc and they don t work </s>
<s> i am reall concerned that somthing may be wrong and if that s the case i m kind of screwed </s>
<s> energy star is not a bios just that it is compliant with the rules </s>
<s> if lt lt f1 gt gt doesn t allow you in try swapping keyboards i think that if the sibnals are bad it won t get them to the computer </s>
