<s> can any one guide me to see what software conflicts can occure and is there any way to solve the problem wihout reinstalling the os </s>
<s> any help will be welcom assaf </s>
<s> in a notebook it matters that the os is known you didn t tell and who installed the os unknown </s>
<s> i ll share one possible fix and not dive into driver discussions until you tell more </s>
<s> gt look up winsockxpfix on google com to repair the usual spyware induced damaged networking that causes a lot of posts like yours </s>
<s> cheers bob </s>
<s> thank you bob the os win xp pro service pack2 with all the updates installed </s>
<s> i am sure this is a software problem </s>
<s> but i verified with spybot microsoft anti spyware and some other anti spy ware as well </s>
<s> i am currently testing winsock xp fix </s>
<s> could a device can be unrecognize due to this kind of a bug </s>
<s> i will post again if that won t solve the problem </s>
<s> thank you assaf os windows xp service pack 2 </s>
<s> it s rare to see this installed by the owner proper </s>
<s> they expected that xp would find all the drivers </s>
<s> sadly we have to check with the laptop maker for bios udpates motherboard drivers and maybe patches </s>
<s> windows update and the mysterious driver update button will not do this for us </s>
<s> my bet is the os install is incomplete </s>
<s> as to winsockxpfix yes the spyware malware is causing such damage </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this may not apply to your problem but this solved my similar problem </s>
<s> thank you i will try it later today currently i wiped all old information and nothing helped should i run the win xp repair problem </s>
<s> i tried it didn t helped it </s>
<s> i am confuse i wipe any info related from the registry and still it is not recognise </s>
<s> 10x assaf </s>
<s> this is exactly how i fixed my problem uninstall the driver for wpc54g from the device manager </s>
<s> download the latest driver from linksys com it will be in a quot zipped quot compressed folder </s>
<s> after extracting the uncompressed folder just run the quot setup exe quot file </s>
<s> if you have other versions of the linksys wireless utility software it will instruct you to remove that program first </s>
<s> if this does not fix your problem then you can try windows repair problem </s>
<s> the problem with windows is that it sometimes installs a bad driver if you allow it </s>
