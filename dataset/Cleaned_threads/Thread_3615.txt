<s> does it matter how much unused space there is on the recovery partition </s>
<s> i don t see where it would matter but would like a second opinion </s>
<s> i made the recovery partition on the new hdd about 600mb smaller of unused space then the orginal </s>
<s> so now it has 517mb of unused space vs about 1 2gb </s>
<s> the whole idea of a recovery partition is to hold the required info needed upon the dreaded later date </s>
<s> if you re using recovery cds and or os from the oem vendor it should automatically make it back to the day it was made at least big name vendors </s>
<s> just follow the prompts or guide for a true mirror image of what was on that 1st day </s>
<s> also i m sure there s a finite space required so reducing it too small isn t going to help maybe hinder the process </s>
<s> if this all to just gain more space is the 600mb worth that much trouble maybe better to get a larger hd if possible </s>
<s> enjoy willy </s>
<s> i worded that poorly </s>
<s> i replaced the hdd in an hp pavilion 304w and created a system and recovery partition on the new hdd </s>
<s> i then cloned the old partitions from the old hdd to the new </s>
<s> there was about 1 2gb of unused space left on the recovery partition of the old hdd </s>
<s> so i couldn t understand why the company left such a large amount of unused wasted space </s>
<s> on the new hdd i left only 512mb of unused space on the recovery partition after cloning of the recovery system </s>
<s> as far as i know the recovery partition isn t wrote to during the recovery process </s>
<s> it only copies the recovery back to the system partition </s>
<s> so i wasn t completely sure that the recovery partition isn t written back to during the recovery process </s>
<s> if it is then maybe i need to make that unused space a little bigger </s>
