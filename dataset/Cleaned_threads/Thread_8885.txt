<s> i m working on my sisters gateway machine that has one of those dual card modems 6001856 </s>
<s> the computer recognizes it and aol does too but when i try to connect online it comes back with a timeout and says no dial tone </s>
<s> i know the line has a dial tone it s the same one i use to dial out on with mine not at the same time either </s>
<s> the computer had a lot of spyware and adware on it among other things which i removed </s>
<s> i also even reinstalled windows without reformatting the hdd </s>
<s> i can t figure this one out </s>
<s> any ideas out there </s>
<s> i had a similar problem to a modem that would not dial sometime found the tone sometimes did a half dial </s>
<s> try reinstalling all the software and hardware if it can be removed </s>
<s> if this doesnt work </s>
<s> the card may be dead </s>
<s> it could be a part that device manager might not reveal that the actual card is bad </s>
<s> modems are cheap so it shouldnt be too bad if this is the case </s>
<s> tyler </s>
<s> i ve actually updated modem driver and placed the card in a different pci slot </s>
<s> still the same situation i m also leaning towards a bad card now </s>
<s> gateway combo card windows me just don t understand why the computer is showing it good </s>
<s> modem initializes and dials but that s it until it times out in 60 seconds </s>
<s> sounds like a bad modem </s>
<s> if i were you i would just buy a new one and save the hassel </s>
<s> here are some good one toward the end of the page that are good </s>
<s> less than 12 tyler </s>
<s> nice to see that you network when you need somwthing </s>
