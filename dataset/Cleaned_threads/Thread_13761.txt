<s> i own a dell xps 600 desktop running a pentium d 3 2ghz processor with 2gb ram and i am looking for ways to improve the performance of my machine if any </s>
<s> i purchased it for the purpose of using very demanding 3d graphics and modeling programs such as 3dstudiomax maya rhinoceros and have come to be a little disappointed in it s ability to run these programs both from a speed side and visual performance side </s>
<s> is it possible to add ram to this machine change processors or otherwise increase the performance via operating system settings </s>
<s> what video card do you have in that system </s>
<s> that may be where you could improve things possibly </s>
