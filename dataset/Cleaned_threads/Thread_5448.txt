<s> most newer and definelty cheaper end model don t have lpt ports just usb </s>
<s> you really need to check the specs on anything that interests you </s>
<s> however if you find no such creature try adding a usb pci card that will allow use of newer printers </s>
<s> just be sure to request one that supports usb2 0 vs 1 but it should anyways for most newer usb cards just ask </s>
<s> to check specs on ainkjet model visit the makers support website for info details that refelect your model </s>
<s> it seems only laserjets come with any ports to attach as it were </s>
<s> enjoy willy </s>
