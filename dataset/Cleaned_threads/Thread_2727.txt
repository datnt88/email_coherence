<s> hi there my router seems to be frozen with all lights on </s>
<s> with power cord in i tried resetting per the dlink website but after several seconds of holding the reset button in it stays frozen </s>
<s> i also tried something called a quot recovery reset quot and that didn t work either </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> try a newer router </s>
<s> i was afraid that it would be too old </s>
<s> i think that i bought it about 2 years ago </s>
<s> i wasn t sure if that was too long </s>
<s> i didn t know what the expiration date for it would be </s>
<s> just hoping for an alternative solution </s>
<s> thanks for your advice </s>
