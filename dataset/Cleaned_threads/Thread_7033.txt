<s> i have recently replaced my old wi fi routers </s>
<s> one was actually running as a router the other as an access point in another part of the house with a cat 5 connection between the two </s>
<s> i couldn t decide what to buy so i ended up getting a belkin wireless n and a d link dir 655 </s>
<s> both have had some good reviews </s>
<s> the d link is functioning as a wireless router the belkin is configured to be a wireless access point </s>
<s> they are on non overlapping channels d link is on channel 11 primary paired with channel 6 secondary and belkin is on channel 1 </s>
<s> my wife complains that her laptop vista home premium 802 11 b or g capable feels sluggish since the change </s>
<s> the other pcs either wired or wireless have not felt different to me and i don t use her laptop enough to have an opinion </s>
<s> most of the time she is logged on to the belkin access point and is the only device attached to it </s>
<s> my laptop win 7 802 11 b g or n capable connects to the d link </s>
<s> it is possible that she is encountering interference from a neighbor or it is possible that one of the wireless devices is functioning below specs or other problems may be coming up </s>
<s> unfortunately i no longer have the old wifi access device she used up until recently because i gave it to my father in law so i can t do direct measured comparisons of speed and i cannot easily check which channel the old one operated on </s>
<s> this raises several questions is there any good way to determine whether the apparent sluggishness comes from things outside our house the access point the router her computer or a source between keyboard and chair </s>
<s> is it possible to determine which wireless protocol she is actually using as opposed to which protocols are available </s>
<s> is there any easy way to figure out what channel the neighbor s wifi is using to see if interference seems likely </s>
<s> from other readings in these forums it does seem that mixing wireless quot g quot with quot n quot and expecting smooth fallback isn t realistic </s>
<s> you might try to temporarily lock your wireless on quot g quot to see if the complaints stop </s>
<s> i believe you can use windows quot tracert quot to determine the connection path of your wife s pc just to make sure she s connecting through the desired device </s>
<s> as for network finders sniffers etc i believe such as quot netstumbler quot might assist in determining who else is broadcasting locally at what signal strength and what channels are in use </s>
<s> there are only 2 802 11n devices in the house and they usually use the same router </s>
<s> the other laptop doesn t have the n protocol and it uses the other router </s>
<s> the problem did improve some when i reconfigured the router my wife is using </s>
<s> it turns out that the belkin unit i bought prefers to have the connection to the network on the wan port when it is set up as a wireless access point </s>
<s> that is different from any other router i ve set up that way </s>
