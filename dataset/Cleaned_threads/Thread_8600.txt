<s> few days ago i let my computer to download a movie </s>
<s> it took few hours </s>
<s> when i came back and wanted to open the movie i found my computer in hang state </s>
<s> then i pressed power button shut it down and started again </s>
<s> it again became hang </s>
<s> i thought its because of virus problem and tried to format </s>
<s> even after multiple tries i couldnot format it </s>
<s> finally i made only one partition of my hard disk and tried to format again </s>
<s> and it worked </s>
<s> this way i did the complete format of my hard disk </s>
<s> however my laptop did not worked out the way i wanted </s>
<s> it is too slow </s>
<s> and if i open up heavy programs having more disk space i e </s>
<s> photoshop dreamweaver etc it becomes hang </s>
<s> i took my laptop to the service center and they said that its the problem of hard disk and i should change my hard disk </s>
<s> but i dont think that my hard disk is totally corrupted and if it is not why should i change my hard disk </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> nowadays i open it in safe mode although it generates a bit more heat than usual it works well </s>
<s> can you please tell me what exactly is the problem </s>
<s> and how can i solve it </s>
<s> if what you call complete format is a system recovery back to factory conditions not really clear your laptop should be as fast as it was when it was new </s>
<s> but i assume you did a lot more than just that such as installing photoshop dreamweaver etc </s>
<s> did they tell you why they think it s the hard disk </s>
<s> it doesn t seem very likely </s>
<s> if it works in safe mode and not in normal mode it could be a problem caused by programs services malware </s>
<s> a new system recovery back to factory conditions is the solution then </s>
<s> but it could also be an issue of your graphic card in safe mode runs in a very basic way in normal mode all of it is used </s>
<s> any other hardware issue motherboard or ram can lead to hangs also </s>
<s> the only way the hard disk could be the problem is that for some reason it doesn t run in dma mode any more but in pio mode </s>
<s> that s easy to check </s>
<s> then a new disk might be the solution </s>
<s> the only way to find the cause is by elimination and even that doesn t always work </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> my friend normally pc hanged because of many things perhaps it is your processor ram or mother board s issue most likely i think it is your ram or processor not the hard disk </s>
<s> the answer above by ralphmark might well be correct </s>
<s> in a recent thread it seems the random freeze was caused by a bad stick of ram </s>
<s> so that s a good starting point for your investigations </s>
<s> you can download a free diagnostic burn to cd yourself from kees </s>
