<s> i am wondering if that card is compatible because the hd 4870 is made by a different company </s>
<s> this is why pci pcie and such slots were invented </s>
<s> so we could install cards compatible with the card slot </s>
<s> does your machine have that needed card slot </s>
<s> yes my machine has one occupied pci e slot from which i will remove my old card </s>
<s> the hd 4870 stats say that it is pci e 2 0 is that something new </s>
<s> if you look into it there is no issue here except the usuals </s>
<s> such as does your machine have the proper sized power supply does the card fit mechanically etc </s>
<s> i am purchasing a new power supply 600w which uses the proper connections for the card </s>
<s> i am not sure about the mechanical fit </s>
