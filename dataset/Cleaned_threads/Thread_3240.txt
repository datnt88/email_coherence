<s> i am running windows xp professional on an asus p4t motherboard with 2gb rdram and 1 8 mhz pentium 4 processor </s>
<s> my sound card is a creative audigy live </s>
<s> my graphics card is an ati all in wonder 7500 i have downloaded all the latest drivers and updates for all my hardware and the operating system here is my problem and it is driving me crazy </s>
<s> when i play the tv on the computer the video and sound are out of sink the sound and video play at different times like a poorly dubbed karate movie </s>
<s> the graphics card uses the sound cards input to play sound through a cable connecting both cards </s>
<s> another weird thing is that my system keeps muting the input volume by itself as though resetting itself </s>
<s> i hope it is just a configuration issue but i am clueless </s>
<s> i m assuming this is recorded tv </s>
<s> if so the mpeg recording could be overtaxing your cpu </s>
<s> unfortunately the all in wonder series is discontinued </s>
<s> if you re using it for tv tuning recording you should dial back it recording quality </s>
<s> if you have a seperate tv tuner a new video card with hardware assisted mpeg playback could help </s>
<s> look for a radeon x1000 or geforce 7000 8000 series video card </s>
<s> actually it is live tv that does this weird huh </s>
<s> i got rid of xp and went back to 2000 and everything works fine now so i guess i am just stuck with an older operating system </s>
