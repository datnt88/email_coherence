<s> i have a doubt regarding raid5 reorganization </s>
<s> suppose we have a raid5 group consisting of 6 disks in a storage system </s>
<s> suppose one disk call it d1 is unreachable i e the disk component does not fail but some component for example some network cable to reach that disk has failed </s>
<s> although the data in d1 is valid the data in d1 is inaccessible </s>
<s> in this scenario will the reorganization will start or some field repairperson will try to repair replace that component </s>
<s> replacing a component seems to take less time than reorganization because reorganization is very costly with respect to time </s>
<s> also data in d1 is valid so just repairing that component will make everything fine </s>
<s> adaptec did this for years </s>
<s> the better systems send you an alert and then you hot swap in the new drive and it s very automatic </s>
<s> however you see folk today try to do this with software and it s not that good </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you mean quot reorganization quot </s>
<s> but replacing the failed component by a new one seems to be more easy when the disk component i e data is valid </s>
<s> because raid5 reorganization may take long time and there is chance of experiencing latent sector error during reorganization </s>
<s> all this occurs on the fly and with no loss of access </s>
<s> i can only guess you are using some pc software raid </s>
