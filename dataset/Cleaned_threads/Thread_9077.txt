<s> i installed my new graphic card and it worked great </s>
<s> i installed drivers rebooted and it was working great </s>
<s> after some time i rebooted the computer again and my monitor won t receive a signal </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> it sounds like you upgraded the video card </s>
<s> did you upgrade the power supply so it wouldn t fail later </s>
<s> i didn t are there any chances that my new graphic card isn t working </s>
<s> if the power supply was barely up to the job then as time passes it ages and then can t do the job </s>
<s> this is the most common thing i encounter and it may be something else but i can only use the clues provided so that s my best guess </s>
<s> if you want more ideas why not supply make model of the parts under discussion </s>
