<s> greetings from scandinavia </s>
<s> i just bought an i7 950 with the extreme6 mb i choose to pick my tri channel ram blocks among the few ddr3 on the market operating at 1 5volts </s>
<s> read that the memory controller in the i7 chip can get damaged by higher voltages </s>
<s> ram specs kingston valueram 3 x 2 gb product code kvr1066d3n7k3 6g 1066 mhz pc3 8500 7 7 7 20 on die termination odt intel extreme memory profiles xmp as rock s mb support page does not have these modules on the compatibility list </s>
<s> now im afraid these kingston ram will cause a problem this is my first rig build </s>
<s> help me figure out whether i should send the ram back </s>
<s> have you tried the ram </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> no i havent tried it yet it has put my building on hold </s>
<s> if so read i see the bios goes to well over 2 0 volts so where did you read that 1 5v would be damaging to the system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i read it in some articles here are the ones i have the adress on the source to my consearns is actually from the supportpage on the x58 extreme6 the modules arent in the supported list </s>
<s> how important is it to follow these guidances </s>
<s> i have wrote to asrock and am in the process of contacting kingston </s>
<s> just thought maybe someone knew how hard one should follow that ddr compatibility list </s>
<s> thanks for answering guys dc </s>
<s> the articles said something about that core i7 s integrated memory controller could get damaged beyond repair by memory modules operating above 1 5v </s>
<s> almost all of the ddr3 triple channel operate at 1 65v but then i found these </s>
<s> havent had the time to try to figure out whether there is a problem or whether those sites articles are just amd freaks bashing superior enemy architecture </s>
<s> just re read those articles and it seems i got it wrong its apparently only a problem when going beyond 1 5 1 65v so im going to return those kingston cause they are too slow </s>
<s> but does anyone know how much one should follow that ddr3 compatibility list for supported modules </s>
<s> the chipset voltage and the memory voltage are on different supplies </s>
<s> i supplied the link to the tom s hardware so you could see that in the screen shot </s>
<s> i don t see the problem </s>
<s> but that doesn t mean people won t fret over this </s>
<s> bob </s>
