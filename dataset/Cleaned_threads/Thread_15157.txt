<s> i am about to upgrade everything in my pc so i need this question answered </s>
<s> what is the difference between intel s 865pe chipset and the 85p chipset </s>
<s> which is the newer or more advanced one </s>
<s> please reply </s>
<s> why intel </s>
<s> why not go for an athlon 64 instead </s>
<s> imo it doesn t make sense to buy a 32 bit processor now unless it is very low priced </s>
<s> 865 and 875 intel series </s>
<s> i recall something about the 875 including what is called pat technology which is supposed to provide a small performance gain </s>
<s> some mb manufacturers such as asus are said to have unlocked it in some of their 865s </s>
<s> i believe intel calls the 875 their quot canterwood quot and the 865 the quot springdale quot </s>
<s> i ve read there is little performance difference however </s>
<s> some say the 865s are a better value </s>
<s> most will now support the intel prescott cpus </s>
