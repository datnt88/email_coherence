<s> i have tried to get into my computer however when i switch it on the microsoft windows xp professional comes up and i press enter but an error screen flashes on and then it goes back to the microsoft windows xp professional menu again </s>
<s> so i created another partition on my computer with the basics and it works fine </s>
<s> trying to access my disk drive and it comes up quot access is denied quot tried to restoring but that failed </s>
<s> any suggestions thanks </s>
<s> xp take ownership </s>
<s> thanks but that doesn t work either </s>
<s> when i try to go in safe mode it kicks me back to the os menu again </s>
<s> safe mode boot failures are now a solid sign of malware damage </s>
<s> over in the storage forum at the top post are ways to get your files out </s>
<s> and a last chance </s>
<s> do not plug in any usb or other thing </s>
<s> try safe mode again </s>
<s> and i know what your question </s>
<s> can you fix safe mode boot failures </s>
<s> i can but on pre installed windows i can t since they remove all the tools to fix it </s>
<s> we get the files out safe then reinstall the os </s>
<s> bob </s>
