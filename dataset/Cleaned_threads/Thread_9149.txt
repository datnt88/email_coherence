<s> doesn t the head set come with an adapter if it does then it will work if it doesn t then look in the manual see if they recommend any bluetooth adapters then buy the recommended adapter if they don t say anything about an adapter to connect to your pc like no recommendations at all then just choose another headset try downloading the manual off the headset s website </s>
