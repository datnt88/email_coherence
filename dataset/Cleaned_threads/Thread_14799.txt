<s> i m considering buying an hp a350n </s>
<s> at 999 minus a 50 rebate it seems like a lot for the money </s>
<s> any opinion </s>
<s> also will a dvd rw disc play on the typical dvd player </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i just paid 119 for some 8x dvd plus and minus rw recorder </s>
<s> that drive is going to annoy you since you can t create a dvd r disc </s>
<s> tell them that you want an all format dvd recorder </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> beware of this product </s>
<s> see my review on cnet </s>
<s> i got two that were defective right out of the box </s>
<s> i gave up on h p after wasting many hours of my time including several hours on the phone with h p s technical support </s>
<s> a dvd rw disk will not play in the typical dvd player </s>
<s> i have tried it on several myself </s>
<s> nard </s>
<s> hmm i am planning to get the new model pavillion a4 custom assembled at hp </s>
<s> i wonder if that new product line would be better than the a3 line </s>
<s> hp has a bad habit of sticking with a quot standard quot in their company even if the customers are screaming </s>
<s> in this case its dvd plus r w drives </s>
<s> you will not be happy with just a plus drive and you will be told by hp or any sales droid that plus will be all you need </s>
<s> given that i can buy an all format 8x dvd recorder for under 149 bucks this is a piece of the machine that is definitely out of tune with today </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i note that even the dell 4600 dvd burner is a plus only drive </s>
<s> what computer manufacturers offer dvd drives </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i m not sure what manufacturues will offer a multi format but if you can get them to leave out the dvd rw and thus leaving an empty drive bay you can just have one added in by a store like circuit city or compusa or you can install one yourself if you know how </s>
