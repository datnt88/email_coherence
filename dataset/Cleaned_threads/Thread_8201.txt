<s> okay so i was in bios and decided to do a really stupid thing </s>
<s> i saw this place that said cpu speed </s>
<s> it stated 133mhz </s>
<s> i hit enter </s>
<s> it said to put in a value bewteen 133 and 200 so i put 200 and then i saved and exited </s>
<s> anyway it went to restart and i have no response from my monitor </s>
<s> i use another video card so i don t use my onboard one </s>
<s> i tried plugging the monitor back into my old onboard video with no success </s>
<s> at startup the hard drive dosen t do its usual beep </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> do i need to reset bios </s>
<s> if so how would i go about doing that without actually going in to the bios </s>
<s> i dont think my mobo is shot because i recieve the annoying long beep if i take my ram out </s>
<s> the only other thing i can think of is that the processor is shot </s>
<s> i put my ear close to it and can hear noise but i m not sure if thats how it usually sounds because i dont ever listen to my processor up close </s>
<s> in case its important im using win xp </s>
<s> 2 4ghz processor 512 ram </s>
<s> i dont really care if i lose whats on my hd so much most of it is backed up and the other stuff is on my ipod </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> ps i posted this in the computer help forum as well </s>
<s> im not sure which is appropriate </s>
<s> find the jumper on your motherboard that says reset cmos </s>
<s> move the jumper as indicated in the motherboard manual restart computer will go t default settings </s>
<s> try 134 next time </s>
<s> okay will do </s>
<s> dont have a mobo manual but i will get it off net </s>
<s> what s 134 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> that your attempt to use 200 mhz was an poor attempt at overclocking </s>
<s> one overclocks the memory bus in 1 mhz steps </s>
<s> thus if you were trying to overclock starting from 133 mhz he says try 134 mhz as the next step </s>
<s> if you want to overclock please do a lot of research to understand the techniques that are used for various types of systems </s>
<s> as ray said baby steps to oc you can also remove the cmos battery to reset the bios </s>
