<s> hi i have 2 toshiba laptops both operating on xp and have wireless network setup </s>
<s> i am able to get on the internet with both but i can only check email on one of them </s>
<s> i am using hotmail as email account and when i log in and wait for it to open my mailbox i get a page cannot be displayed error </s>
<s> anyone have any trouble shooting ideas </s>
<s> i have tried my gmail account also to no avail on the one machine so i don t think it is the email provider something with my settings on the one laptop </s>
<s> any ideas greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks doug </s>
<s> is it up to date </s>
<s> hi i am using a linksys router that i just bought last week at best buy so i would assume everything would be up to date </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> can t assume that </s>
<s> latest version 4 20 7 release date 8 25 2005 the mfg </s>
<s> could have boxed your router months ago </s>
<s> if it is the router s software why would hotmail and other email work on my other computer </s>
<s> wouldn t it be all or nothing </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> some webpages including free webmail sites have objects in them javascript activex etc </s>
<s> that have the potential to install behave like malware </s>
<s> there are software routines in your computer that can be blocking these antispyware firewalls etc </s>
<s> routers often contain firewalls and filters too </s>
<s> r proffit was wise in recommending a firmware upgrade </s>
<s> at least you can eliminate the router s firmware in your troubleshooting </s>
<s> in internet options what happens when you clear all cookies and delete files offline files too </s>
<s> that new meant you didn t have to check the firmware </s>
<s> in short since i ve already noted the firmware must be checked here s why </s>
<s> the mtu may be too high and email retrieval will fail for some </s>
<s> to fix this issue the newer firmware addresses this so you don t have to </s>
<s> let s remove the firmware from the probable list of causes </s>
