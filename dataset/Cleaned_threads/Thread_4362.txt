<s> i know similar questions have been posted buy my situation is a little different so i will explain it here </s>
<s> a couple of days ago i had a new wireless home security system installed </s>
<s> with it they provided a new router d link dir 601 replacing an existing linksys e 3000 that i owned </s>
<s> this didn t hurt my feelings because i was having major issues with the e 3000 and was going to replace it anyway </s>
<s> as a part of the security system set up they had to assign a new ip address to the router 192 168 36 1 so all of the home security components can access it </s>
<s> as i said i planned on replacing the linksys and in fact had ordered a new asus rt n56u dual band the day before </s>
<s> i like the dual band capabilities because of all of the streaming devices that are used in my house x box tv s netflix etc </s>
<s> well it arrived today and i want to install it </s>
<s> my question is how do i make the asus my primary router for all of my computers and multimedia components but still use the d link with it s ip address for my home security network </s>
<s> we are totally wireless no hardwired connections with only 1 dsl line </s>
<s> any help is greatly appreciated </s>

<s> this is discussed in the forum sticky but </s>
<s> the lazy way to do this is to use your new router as a switch ap </s>
<s> hook a cable between lan ports on both your new and old router </s>
<s> all your devices will use 192 168 36 0 you should still be able to use all the wireless capability just none of the router functions </s>
<s> mostly it would be firewall and content filter type stuff </s>
<s> the other way is to run the dual nat configuration </s>
<s> you would put your new router on the dsl and then plug the wan interface of the security router to a lan port of the new router </s>
<s> the main disadvantage to doing this is if you need to map ports from the internet to a device in your security area you have to map the ip though both routers </s>
<s> it is also much more troublesome to make machines talk between the 2 networks than if they were on the same subnet </s>
<s> my only concern with the quot lazy quot way is won t i lose the benefit of the 801 11n transfer rates because it will bottle neck at the d link router </s>
<s> because of that i m thinking that setting it up with the dual nat config would be the better of the two options </s>
<s> don t think i would need to map anything to the security system but won t know until i set it up i guess </s>
<s> you should get no bottlenecks directly as a result of dlink </s>
<s> in theory the only traffic that should ever pass from the linksys to the dlink would be going to the internet </s>
<s> any traffic between devices on the linksys would talk directly since they are on the same subnet and have no need to pass the traffic though the default gateway </s>
<s> i guess you could swap the routers and hook the internet to your linksys and have it be the dhcp server for 192 168 36 0 just to avoid changing all your end devices and then use the dlink as a switch ie hooks its lan port to the linksys </s>
