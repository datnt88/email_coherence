<s> i have a second pc that i rarely use anymore </s>
<s> but recently while running it really loud noises started in the tower and then the screen froze up </s>
<s> i ended up shutting it down by pulling the plug was the only way </s>
<s> when i plugged it back up i got a message saying no c drive detected and the noise came back ok my question is what happened and should i try to fix it </s>
<s> if so what could it be </s>
<s> and or should i just throw it out </s>
<s> the best part of noise you follow your ear and find what s making the noise </s>
<s> thus you take it from there </s>
<s> if you haven t open your case this is a good time to do so </s>
<s> repeated power ups may seal the fate of whatever is making the noise or the whole system </s>
<s> come back with what you ve found </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the cover is off and right now it is running normal so im waiting on the noise again stand by </s>
<s> i was running it scanning for disk errors and it made the noise but only a brief moment then stopped also after that there was ticking like a clock then a thud now it is just locked up and will not do anything </s>
<s> you should definitely check to see that any existing fans are running okay but it sounds to me at first glance you have a demo ed hard drive </s>
<s> ticking like a clock and then a thud is a pretty good indication the read arm is defective and most likely broken all together </s>
<s> if it s still accessing c drive it may not be too late to get your stuff off of there </s>
<s> this doesn t mean the rest of the unit is garbage just the hard drive needs replacing </s>
<s> if it s particularly old it may not be worth it to you to replace the hard drive if in fact that s the problem </s>
<s> there s a remote possibility it s a fan and an overheat is wht s causing the lock up but i really doubt it </s>
