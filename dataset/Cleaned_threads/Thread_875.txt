<s> hia all iv got a pc and bought a new drive wich also needed a small wire to conect the power suply to the hdd molex to sata converter wich i borowed from a friend of mine so then i formated and installed wind xp and it worked fine after a few days i dicided to by one ov thos wires molex to sata of my own so i inserted it and gave the other wire back to my friend but the pc wont recognise the hdd so what can i do </s>
<s> logic says there is something wrong with that adapter </s>
<s> try your friends again just to confirm </s>
<s> if that adapter works and yours still does not perhaps you can exchange it for another one </s>
<s> here s where a dvm would come in real handy though </s>
<s> isnt that an adapter for the power </s>
<s> so its obviously not getting power </s>
<s> make sure the 4 pin molex is plugged all the way and that the wholes are lined up </s>
<s> and that the sata end is plugged in all the way too </s>
<s> or just try another adapter </s>
