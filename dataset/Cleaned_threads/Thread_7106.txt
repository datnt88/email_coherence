<s> i m considering purchasing a dell 960 printer </s>
<s> i believe that the printer is manufactured by lexmark </s>
<s> one thing that concerns me is that dell says you must purchase the ink cartridges from dell and the lexmark cartridges will not work with this printer </s>
<s> does anyone know if that is true </s>
<s> i sure would like the option to purchase my ink cartridges locally </s>
<s> it s a pure marketing play </s>
<s> yes i see the printers and they look smell like lexmarks </s>
<s> but why go there </s>
<s> very nice printers are under 99bucks locally without this issue to solve </s>
<s> in fact tell them to keep the printer if this is the issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i hope you didn t buy the poc you re stuck buying dell branded lexmark ink all the reliability studies by the major magazines put the lexmark products at the bottom of the list </s>
<s> you get what you pay for take a look at the value you might get from another manufacturer it truly depends what you d like to print and how much </s>
<s> lexmark does make the dell model </s>
<s> the whole difference is the mounting tab in effect slightly different in order to interfere with using non dell labeled carts </s>
<s> this isn t an uncommon practice but why deal with it just get the same looking lexmark ptr </s>
<s> model </s>
<s> btw lexmark tend to have more costly ink carts compared to other brands </s>
<s> believe me shop around and get a different non dell ptr </s>
<s> all those other ptrs </s>
<s> will work by heck its your choice </s>
<s> willy </s>
<s> i got the same answer from dell about the a960 printer only dell cartridges fit </s>
<s> i did a search on dell printer cartridges and found a web site quot http that identified that the printers are made by lexmark but they keyed the print cartridges differently for dell </s>
<s> therefore only dell cartridges will fit or the 4inkjet com claims to make a refill kit for that printer </s>
<s> i plan to check compusa bestbuy and staples local stores </s>
<s> i complained to the salesperson who could care less about my complaint </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i have refilled these cartridges without a problem with a kit i got from printpal com or 77colors com sorry i can t remember which </s>
<s> but it is the only affordable way to deal with this printer </s>
<s> the dell printer have a little tab that prevent the ink holder from locking with a lexmark cartridge </s>
<s> i cut off the tab and i am running with a lexmark cartridge just fine </s>
<s> its stupid cos the cartridges are all the same price 40 dollars cdn what a rip off i am going to refill it </s>
<s> they give you a good price on the printer but buy a couple of cartridges and you might as well have gone with something better </s>
<s> my real problem is the a960 i cant use as a standalone fax some faxes just are completely received by the other side although the machine tells me its okay dell sux lexmark sux all a money grab no quality </s>
