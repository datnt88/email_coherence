<s> i have my neighbors computer that is failing to boot past the initial american megatrends screen </s>
<s> she said that she was having trouble with her dialup and somehow got into the bios </s>
<s> she changed two values from quot yes quot to quot no quot and now it won t get past the quot american megatrends tvx0619b quot screen </s>
<s> it s a biostar mb 8500tvx a mother board </s>
<s> i have tried clearing the cmos by strapping jp4 and also removed the clock chip that also has the battery in it for 10 minutes or so </s>
<s> nothing seems to help </s>
<s> holding keys down on the keyboard won t force a keyboard error either </s>
<s> is there any way to force it into setup this early on in the boot process or is it toast </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>

<s> have you tried going back into bios and changing the settings to optimized or fail safe </s>
