<s> well after 7 years my dell dimension 4300 hd finally up and died on me </s>
<s> even though this computer was old and slow it was perfect for some functions i needed to conduct </s>
<s> i have several laptops for serious processing power </s>
<s> i want to resurrect this box and i was wondering what i could buy to replace the dead hd </s>
<s> it was a 40g ide drive </s>
<s> any suggestions are appreciated </s>
<s> while i could safely write any 120gb drive of the old ide interface will do small details such as the version of the bios the exact version of your xp cd </s>
<s> will be needed if you want to go past 120gb </s>
<s> but don t know for how much longer </s>
<s> i wouldn t try to go larger though </s>
<s> seagate and wd s should be fine and run under 40 bucks web priced </s>
<s> for what i use this computer for increasing hd to 80g is fine it doubles the size of the original hd </s>
<s> i figure i will spend some to attempt to get some of the data transferred </s>
<s> do you have a recommendation on manufacturer model etc </s>
<s> here in the us i paid 60 bucks for a refurb 750gb sata hard disk </s>
<s> surely you can find an 80 for not much more at newegg com or geeks com as to paying for transfer of the data why would i do that when i have a cable like and free cloning software like g4u </s>
<s> sorry but this is an area i feel you diy or pay up </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am located in the us as well so finding a drive i think is a rather easy feat </s>
<s> the question had more to do with i did not know what i could replace the drive with and was looking for recommendations size type manufacturer etc </s>
<s> can i replace an ide drive with a sata </s>
<s> as for transferring the data if the original drive worked then i would have no problem in transferring data myself </s>
<s> so i figure if the data is recoverable then i will happily pay to have the data recovered and transferred </s>
<s> thank you to everyone who has replied thus far </s>
<s> it has been very helpful </s>
<s> find a drive that fits your need or case etc </s>
<s> look at the user feedback </s>
<s> for the most part the ones that write quot i couldn t make it work quot are the ones to avoid </s>
<s> gt in closing currently the hard disk makers are just like getting gas from texaco bp or hess </s>
<s> maybe there is someone that can write a convincing treatise on why one is preferred over the other </s>
