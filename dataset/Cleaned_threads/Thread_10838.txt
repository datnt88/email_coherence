<s> i reside in a university residence and i own both a laptop and a desktop </s>
<s> there is a single network point in my room </s>
<s> i keep my desktop connected to this as this is where i get internet access </s>
<s> i want to sync both my laptop and desktop and this usually involves me unplugging the lan cable and plugging it into my laptop </s>
<s> i m looking for an easier solution </s>
<s> can i buy a usb wifi stick for my desktop and connect simultaneously to my laptop wirelessly and the university network via cable </s>
<s> note both pcs have windows 7 x64 </s>
<s> plug it into the college connection </s>
<s> for some reason the it department doesn t like it when guys attach routers to their ports </s>
<s> i don t need the notebook to access the net </s>
<s> i just want to sync it with files on my desktop </s>
<s> thanks though </s>
<s> if so i d think you could add another ethernet card to the desktop and use a crossover cable for data transfer </s>
<s> you d have to use static ip addressing for the laptop nic and the new nic for the desktop </s>
