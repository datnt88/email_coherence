<s> i was going to post this in the norton forum but they wont let you post anything unless it relates to having a problem with their products so i ll give this to any software developer over the past 20 years ive been able to recover fried hdd s simply by powering it on and off multiple times sometimes 20 or 30 times </s>
<s> it would be nice if a developer would automate this process perhaps as part of their existing hdd diagnostic software </s>
<s> the software would have to power on the drive wait to verify access or no bad error messages and if fails power off for 30 seconds </s>
<s> its a simple program but but it needs to be put in place </s>
<s> im still waiting for them to develop a device that will gently slam a hdd on a countertop repeatedly because that sometimes works </s>
<s> heh heh </s>
<s> what exactly does that mean </s>
<s> i have an external hard drive that has a broken motor i m pretty sure </s>
<s> i ve tried everything </s>
<s> do you think repeatedly connecting to power wouold do any good at all </s>
<s> i am seriously considering slamming it on something </s>
<s> does that include connecting it to an internal port in the pc </s>
<s> i d think a broken motor would cause a distinctive sound or lack of one </s>
<s> there is the old freezer method which i ve never tried and skeptical of anyway but i ve heard others swear it works </s>
<s> and i also tried the freezer method which also didn t work </s>
<s> it does make a distinctive noise an intermittent beeping which is supposedly the sign of a damaged motor for maxtor drives </s>
<s> so i guess i am out of luck </s>
<s> i d really like to get the data back but not enough to want to pay a retrieval service big bucks </s>
<s> maybe i will try slamming it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i have personally experienced that this method sometimes works and sometimes doesnt </s>
<s> but its always worth a few tries </s>
<s> its always best to submit such drives to data recovery experts </s>
<s> absent that you can always buy a working used replica of your drive and very carefully swap out the data disks </s>
