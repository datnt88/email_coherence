<s> i d been wondering if cables marked usb 2 were really faster than usb 1 and worth the extra money </s>
<s> so i decided to test the speed </s>
<s> not scientifically by any fashion but the results were interesting </s>
<s> i just used the sweep second hand on my wrist watch </s>
<s> my machine specs home built with shuttle main board with 6 usb 2 ports amd 2400 xp processor 512 meg ram </s>
<s> optical drive sony 52 32 52 cd burner </s>
<s> drive case bytecc usb 2 </s>
<s> procedure copy a large file from the usb drive to a folder on my hd </s>
<s> i used the supplied usb 2 cable that came with the case and a several year old usb 1 cable from an older usb zip 100 drive </s>
<s> file copied ie6 full 48 meg in size from a cd rw disk that i had burned a while back </s>
<s> results usb 1 cable took 25 seconds </s>
<s> usb 2 cable took 19 seconds </s>
<s> so there you are folks </s>
<s> i suspect some cables may be more equal than others some of the earlier or real cheap usb1 cables might not do quiet as well but your overall results are quite interesting </s>
<s> usb1 and usb2 cables are wired exactly the same </s>
<s> the usb2 cables are shielded better and thus can be spec ed for higher signal speed than the older usb1 cables </s>
<s> however depending upon the environment how quot rf noisy quot and cable length a very short run of usb1 cable should be able to handle the higher speed of usb2 </s>
<s> usb1 actually usb1 1 or otherwise called quot usb full speed quot interface is supposed to go 12 mbps mega bits per second and usb2 or otherwise called quot usb hi speed quot is supposed to go 480 mbps </s>
<s> 12 mbps is approximately 1 5 mbps mega bytes per second and 480 mbps is approximately 60 mbps </s>
<s> but that does not provide for any protocol overhead and other loss </s>
<s> so far neither interface is yet living up to the hype </s>
<s> i think on a good day usb1 interface is typically getting about half of its promise around 0 8 mbps and usb2 is typically getting much less than a third of its promise at about 8 to 20 mbps </s>
