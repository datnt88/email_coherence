<s> some of them like lenovo or gateway only allow for 2gigs of ram </s>
<s> looking into the future 2 gigs doesn t seem as if it s going to have a lot of staying power </s>
<s> i need opinions as to whether or not a 2 gig maximum is going to be sufficient say 9 mo </s>
<s> to a year from now </s>
<s> i d like a computer that will not become obsolete all to quickly </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> very few home machines get such upgrades and vista that came with that box is all of 32 bit so that means crazy things like ram may only register 3 to 3 5 gb even with 4gb installed </s>
<s> sorry it s not a big deal for how long such a machine lasts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if you have vista and put a higher end video card in your system 3gb of ram may be useful </s>
<s> vista handles ram differently </s>
<s> for example you upgrade to a 256mb dedicated ram video card </s>
<s> vista will use up to 1023mb of total system ram for graphics including the card s 256mb </s>
<s> so the rest of your system will have up to 768mb less ram for other things excluding graphics </s>
<s> with ddr2 prices dropping why not </s>
<s> i put in an extra gb for like 50 00 </s>
<s> now put your 50 bucks into your video card </s>
