<s> i d like to upgrade my sony pcv rx650 which currently has the original 80gb ata 100 hd and 512mb ram though i m upgrading memory as well </s>
<s> i d like to add a second internal hard drive of 200 250 gb capacity if possible </s>
<s> what if any issues might i have </s>
<s> from what i understand ata 100 or ata 133 doesn t really matter </s>
<s> i see some of the drives maxtor ultra 7200 series require and additional pci card slot </s>
<s> what are the benefits negatives versus a drive that doesn t require an additional card slot </s>
<s> all slots are currently occupied unless i remove the fax telephony card which isn t used anyway </s>
<s> any suggestions on drives brands </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> what operating system and service pack number are you using </s>
<s> if you are using windows xp you need to at least have service pack 1 sp1 installed to use hard drives over 137gb </s>
<s> i have not experienced any major differences between ata 100 and ata 133 </s>
<s> your motherboard is ata 100 however you still can install an ata 133 drive </s>
<s> it will be compatible </s>
<s> you have two ata slots on the motherboard each capable of handling two drives making four total </s>
<s> maxtor wants you to spend money on an ata hard drive controller card that supports ata 133 if your integrated ata hard drive controller is only ata 100 </s>
<s> it is not required necessary </s>
<s> another issue i see is finding space to insert the drive inside that case </s>
<s> try not stack one hard drive directly on top of another with say only a cm between them </s>
<s> heat is the enemy of computer components including hard drives </s>
<s> if you have a free 5 25 drive bay you could put the drive there as an option </s>
<s> if you ever have to install a pci card for any reason you can use combination cards to fit all of your functionality </s>
<s> for example you can have usb firewire and a 10 100 network port all on one pci card </s>
<s> windows xp home sp2 </s>
<s> there is a second 3 5 hard drive bay but it does place it very close to the other hard drive </s>
<s> no free 5 25 bays </s>
<s> thanks </s>
