<s> to all who can help plz do </s>
<s> a couple days ago my pc got fried </s>
<s> i smelled smoke from the back and my pc died </s>
<s> i replaced the power supply but still won t boot up </s>
<s> pull the battery out and the plug and replaced them </s>
<s> the power supply fan spins as well as the fan for processor but no video and no beep just a low tone </s>
<s> i removed the video card and plugged directly to motherboard still no video </s>
<s> is there anything i can try b4 i end up just replacing motherboard and if needed the processor </s>
<s> when this happens the power supply can wipe out all connected devices </s>
<s> but try it with just a few parts such as psu motherboard cpu and heatsink </s>
<s> no cards or ram is required because we just want beeps </s>
<s> and in closing some forget the atx12v connection but this pc is not well described so that s a guess </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have tried as described </s>
<s> this is no beeps </s>
<s> everything remove except cpu psu motherboard with 4 pin atx connected </s>
<s> again i m missing make model and such but read the manual on how to clear the cmos and try again </s>
<s> be sure to measure the cmos battery because if it s too low some motherboards don t boot </s>
