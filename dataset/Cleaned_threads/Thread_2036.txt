<s> hi all i haven t been here for a very long time since my last pc build just a little under 2 years ago so i am really out of the loop with hardware and stuff so once more i have returned to ask for the help and support of those more technology knowledgeable than i basically i start university on the 16th of september and will be moving away from home for the first time </s>
<s> after much consideration and due to my limited budget i have decided to try and build a new desktop pc rather than buying a cheap laptop </s>
<s> my budget is around 65443 500 for the system and monitor and due to limited desk space i will definitely need an lcd screen 19 quot maybe </s>
<s> primary uses listening to music i am planning to purchase a set of 2 1 speakers and to use my pc as my main audio device instead of taking a hifi system down to university </s>
<s> the usual sort of office stuff word excel running together with irc msn maybe and also the music playing together with any other background things makes me wonder if i need a dual core </s>
<s> secondary uses i will likely watch movies regularly in order to make use of the unlimited download bandwidth in campus in the first year </s>
<s> i will probably play on a few games but i m not a big gamer and if i do play games they tend to be strategy games and the like rather than first person shooters and stuff so frame rate isn t a huge problem for me but a nice looking screen would be good </s>
<s> as i will go very soon this leaves me just a few days to decide upon what parts i want for my pc so that i can order them and get the system put together before i head off to university </s>
<s> therefore i would really really appreciate any support and advice any of you can offer on this subject as to be honest i just don t know what combination within my price range will give me the best performance for the above stuff </s>
<s> thanks in advance to anybody who is willing to give me a helping hand </s>
<s> kindest regards john </s>

<s> what s your budget </s>
<s> i can give you advice and give a rough list of parts but i have no idea what uk prices are like as i live in the us </s>
<s> that budget is 500 </s>
<s> the pound symbol didn t translate in your post </s>
<s> i ve been working at a major computer retailer here in the states for the past two years and it made me realize for that price range it can be really hard to beat a compaq emachine etc </s>
<s> i am talking regular no rebate full retail prices </s>
<s> so my advice is just make sure you price match some pre built systems against what you are going to build you may be suprised </s>
<s> yeah it is 500 uk pounds </s>
<s> as for retail machines i check with dell and it seems they cut corners in areas which i could cover in i choose carefully </s>
<s> what website are you buying from </s>
<s> can you post a link </s>
<s> if you post a link i ll make a list of parts that fits your budget </s>
<s> thanks nathan </s>
<s> unless you re a serious gamer something like an acer aspire 1642zwlm for 425 pounds inc vat w centrino 1 7ghz 512mb 60gb dvd burner 15 quot widescreen is hard to beat </s>
<s> you can probably shop around and get this one for less or a better one still under your budget </s>
<s> you can tote a laptop to class library and bring it home on holidays </s>
<s> in the us laptops are required at a number of universities as you must bring them to certain classes </s>
