<s> i cannot believe i am having this much trouble finding a laser printer that prints on 80 lbs 216 gsm coverstock that is 3 1 2 quot x 4 7 8 quot typical 4bar or a1 flat card size </s>
<s> why is this not something that laser printers can do </s>
<s> again i want to be able to print on an a1 flat card size piece of coverstock 80 lbs or 216 gsm </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> for example finds prior discussions </s>
<s> you can hit hp com and it s chat button among other makers to ask directly </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that s why i am asking here </s>
<s> the key to this question is the size of the paper a1 4bar 3 1 2 quot x4 7 8 quot and the thickness of 80 or 216gsm </s>
<s> i have been on the phone online chat with hp xerox and dell and seems most of the people answering the phones cannot understand what 3 5 quot wide means let alone 4 7 8 quot in height </s>
<s> does anyone know of a laser printer that can print on an a1 flat card 3 1 2 quot x 4 7 8 quot size piece of coverstock 80 lbs or 216 gsm </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i read and see this </s>
<s> quot postcard 3 x 5 in 4 x 6 in quot so while it hit your weight of the paper it missed the 5 inch side by 1 8 inch </s>
<s> it appears nothing does this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this appears to be something your print shops produce </s>
<s> i think they would consider a printer like this one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> now you see the reason for the post bob </s>
<s> actually most smaller print shops buy the 8 5 quot x 11 quot cardstock 80 paper print and then have it cut to size </s>
<s> all printers i have seen say they can handle custom sizes from width of 3 quot to 8 5 quot and height of 5 quot to 14 quot which means they are all short by 1 8th inch in height </s>
<s> why the hell a manufacturer wouldn t make a printer that accepts a1 flat card size is beyond me </s>
<s> since it is a standard and not much of a difference </s>
<s> geez </s>
<s> thanks for the info on the fladbed printers but i am not paying 10k for a printer </s>
<s> so the question is still there does anyone know of a laser printer that can print on an a1 flat card 3 1 2 quot x 4 7 8 quot size piece of coverstock 80 lbs or 216 gsm </s>
<s> and let s be honest </s>
<s> we have for years exceeded the specs on paper weight on many printers </s>
<s> sure the warranty is not going to be honored but you smile as you put your 120lb stock through the straight path and it works </s>
<s> it s possible that that printer will work with the 1 8 inch shy stock but are you running into folk that demand it be in the specs and not go with what may work </s>
<s> and yes this is why we had a sheer in the print shop </s>
<s> print it on a stock size then cut to size </s>
<s> it s been an amazing journey as i see folk that wonder how we got edge to edge printing on such stock </s>
<s> we never did </s>
<s> we printed then put it in the sheer cutter </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you need to visit the vendor websites and check the specs </s>
<s> i suspect you went to the common ones but overall if you want cheap or basic home office once you get out of the norm they won t carry it </s>
<s> this is where i suggest you find commercial application laser that will be more expensive but they do the job </s>
<s> i don t know the final costs but going to local staples or best buy etc aren t always helpful for specifics at times </s>
<s> you can check with a local business and see what they offer like business copy and printer sellers </s>
<s> at least they have catalogs or sales people that could help </s>
<s> konica canon ricoh and sharp are big suppliers for business so don t be surprised no hp or dell or common brands </s>
<s> you can check out quot refurbed units quot to help reduce costs or commercial trade papers or online sources </s>
<s> also i m sure what you want should be in quot flat stock quot path printing too heavy media doesn t bend well plus is a demanding media to print on </s>
<s> any cheap laser may print ok but movement of media maybe a problem over time </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
