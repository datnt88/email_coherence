<s> my hard drive recently stopped working after my laptop took a fall </s>
<s> i replaced the hd with a new one and re installed the os win7 so my laptop is up and running again </s>
<s> here s the hard part i used a usb to sata converter for my old hard drive to pull the data off i ve recovered a good portion of the files now how do i put them to use on my laptop with the new hd </s>
<s> i ve copied the files from the old hd and saved them in a folder already </s>
<s> it s mostly pics music and documents </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> you have a 2 5 quot from the old laptop that allowed you to extract some data </s>
<s> i d think you could buy a usb enclosure and put the drive in that and just reconnect it to the laptop </s>
<s> but what you didn t tell is what you ve already put the old data on </s>
<s> you might offer that information </s>
<s> i put the old data in a folder on my laptop </s>
<s> i tried to transfer the old files to the new hard drive by copy paste but i ran into issues because i received an error message that i didn t have quot permissions quot to make any changes </s>
<s> so i created a folder called toshiba hd and dropped the old files in there </s>
<s> i don t think i can use the old hard drive as back up storage or at least i can t afford for a professional to attempt to fix it for me or i d just buy another hd caddy and make it a salve to the other because there is a second bay to install another hd on my laptop </s>
<s> i m basically just trying to get my old documents settings pics and music back on my laptop </s>
<s> shame on me for not back it up it ll never happen again </s>
<s> on the same hard drive </s>
<s> then you should be able to put the old drive into a usb enclosure and copy out the data from there as long as the drive is still accessible </s>
<s> the other method would have been to use a usb flash drive </s>
<s> maybe i m not seeing the issue properly but it seems to me that copying the data to other media would have been and still might be the way to go </s>
<s> right i was able to copy the data and create a new folder in my library on the new hard drive </s>
<s> the old drive was moderately functional </s>
<s> i just don t know what to do with the files to get my settings documents and pics and music back to where it was </s>
<s> the files i copied don t say my documents or my music when i open them it s like reading a foreign language that s the reason i was trying to paste them to my new drive c but it wouldn t allow me to do that because i didn t have permission to do so still not understanding that one </s>
<s> and i do appreciate your input in case i hadn t mentioned that before </s>
<s> your quot my documents quot folders and sub folder but just random files from the hard drive did you </s>
<s> all you really needed was what you created or saved in the way of personal data and not files from programs </s>
<s> sorry but i can t picture at all what you did now or what the files were </s>
<s> you said the old drive was quot moderately functional quot </s>
<s> is it possible that it still may be in that condition </s>
<s> if so a usb enclosure might allow you access to your quot my documents quot folder to just extract what you have deliberately saved </s>
<s> there may also be stuff in the downloads folder if you used the default windows structure </s>
<s> i m going to head over to microcenter and purchase a usb enclosure i have the hd in the freezer still so maybe i can fire it up again </s>
<s> i would like to try and take the info from there and put it back on my hard drive </s>
<s> i m not too concerned with the drivers and what not i replaced most of them using the back up cd but my documents pics and music are important </s>
<s> when i was copying the data from the old hd i couldn t find any specific folders that had quot my documents quot or quot my music etc </s>
<s> and i had my win7 library set up with about 20 different subfolders as well but i guess i can kiss that all goodbye since i reinstalled the os after i replaced the hard drive </s>
<s> thank you for all of your help steven it is greatly appreciated </s>
