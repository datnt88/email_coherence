<s> i own a dell dimension 8300 it had 512mb ram until i formatted the c drive and now its saying it only has 256mb ram </s>
<s> i use a studio max and need all the memory i can get </s>
<s> can anyone help me </s>
<s> o ya i have an 875p motherboard if thats of any use </s>
<s> finally as im new to this forum i was wondering can you get direct replies to you email address </s>
<s> a bios display </s>
<s> or windows </s>
<s> in windows there s a box that you can limit the reported memory but you need to tell more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> did you try unplugging and reseating the memory </s>
<s> yes when i started the computer some writing came up on the screen is this a bios display saying the memory had changed </s>
<s> a friend called up to me yesterday he worked in dell before so i suppose he knows the inside of a computer better than me and just did the old fashioned thing </s>
<s> he took out the memory stick and put it back in and its working fine now </s>
<s> one problem i have now though is when i open ms word it takes longer than it should like 10 15 seconds and sometimes when i right click on a file it takes a while for the options to appear </s>
<s> i have all my antivirus software up to date and did a full system scan which didnt detect anything </s>
<s> could the slowdown be due to spyware perhaps or cookies </s>
<s> yes a friend did it for me yesterday and it worked </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> only problem now is sometimes when i have applications like cad or word open and when i click on file it takes about ten seconds for the menu to appear </s>
<s> this has never happened before </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> spyware maybe </s>
<s> i m unsure about your question </s>
<s> are you asking if you should use the tools like spybot adaware cwshredder and housecall to be sure your machine is pest free </s>
<s> why be uncertain </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> besides the programs robert mentioned you may want to consider what is going on when you do this </s>
<s> if your system has been idle for a while the hard drive may spin down and have to spin up to speed </s>
<s> if you click on file once and it is slow what happens the next time is it still slow if not that may be the reason </s>
<s> you have more than one system and have mapped a networked drive from another and that system is not turned on the file view window can be very slow coming up </s>
<s> if you are using norton anti virus 2002 this is a common problem </s>
<s> fixed in 2003 </s>
<s> i would wonder what happened prior to your quot lost quot memory </s>
<s> perhaps a more comprehensive cleaning is in order </s>
<s> dirty contacts or perhaps what may have caused the memory to lose contact is at issue </s>
<s> you could also have heat issues or even power supply issues </s>
<s> that does not exclude application or system software or spyware as being a new and different problem </s>
<s> i don t think reseating the memory fixes or relates to those problems </s>
<s> bob i am interested in your reply post to another with missing ram </s>
<s> you said there is a box in windows that can limit ram </s>
<s> i need more info on this </s>
<s> i put in 2 ea 1 gb sticks of ram on my dell 4600 2 8mhz single core windows xp home system </s>
<s> when my system slowed down all of a sudden i found it was registering only 1 gb of ram </s>
<s> i reseated then swapped ram sticks with each other with no improvement </s>
<s> so i either have a configuration problem or my second ram slot on the mb is bad </s>
<s> hopefully you can provide the needed info on the configs </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> dave h </s>
