<s> i have this router and it shows on the internet setup page that it can be configured as an ethernet bridge but how </s>
<s> nothing in the manual on or dynex s support site that i can find </s>
<s> i want to use it as a remote wifi adaptor </s>
<s> my situation is this i live in an rv fulltime the skin of the rv is metal thus signal strength is cut way back when inside on laptop </s>
<s> i want to place in a weatherproof box this router about thirty feet above my rv on an antenna mast run cat 5 cable to my laptop inside </s>
<s> i have an ethernet bridge that is plug and play but is a very expensive model and i do not wish to risk losing it to vandels thieves or high winds </s>
<s> i wanted to use this dynex router as a bridge since they are only 29 on sale </s>
<s> i have tried setting it via the web setup as a bridge matched the channel and ssid to the broadcasting access point there is no security it s an open network it still shows up as being an access point in netstumbler and does not make a connection as a bridge </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> i need detailed simple information as i am not to swift with this networking stuff </s>
<s> in the router s web interface </s>
<s> as well i m fairly certain you d at least need the mac address of the ap as well as some other cooperation from it through it s owner </s>
<s> is this a public site for users in an rv park </s>
<s> personally however i d be a bit leery of putting up a 30 foot lightning rod that connects to my laptop </s>
<s> you might have other options such as a repeater that could pick up the signal near a window </s>
<s> i have the mac address and all that info just need to know how to configure the router to perform as a bridge </s>
<s> the bridge tab in setup does not have many options to choose from and no directions </s>
<s> as far as lightning goes this is not a permanent installation and lightning is infrequent in the winter months </s>
<s> if you do not have first hand knowledge of how to set it up why respond </s>
<s> because i know you cannot accomplish this with just your router settings </s>
<s> a bridge is an association between two components </s>
<s> that s why i said you need cooperation from the ap </s>
<s> the ap will connect multiple users to a wireless network but not bridge networks which is essentially what you re wanting to do </s>
<s> you re right </s>
<s> i don t know how to set up your router as a bridge </s>
<s> what i m saying is that it s not going to help do what you are trying to do </s>
<s> if the ap has a bridge mode and you can change it as well you ve got a chance </s>
<s> the little bit of wireless bridging i ve done fixes the devices on their mac hardware addresses and uses authentication codes for security </s>
<s> here s a link that might help </s>
<s> sorry if i can t </s>
