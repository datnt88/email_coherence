<s> i installed a wireless printserver with my epson printer which connects through my wireless router </s>
<s> the print server has to be connected via the wireless router and the 10 100 connection </s>
<s> the pc wireless router and printer are all located upstairs in my office </s>
<s> this works fine </s>
<s> i can print from my wireless laptop downstairs to my printer upstairs </s>
<s> my question is can i connect another stand alone wireless printserver to my printer downstairs without connecting via the 10 100 which is upstairs to access a wireless printer downstairs </s>
<s> another words a stand alone printer server 802 11g that will work with the downstairs printer </s>
<s> mike </s>
<s> that i completely understand your situation so please confirm the following summary upstairs wireless router wired print server printer1 you want to connect the downstairs printer to wireless router wireless router wireless g print server printer2 key wired wireless answer you can connect multiple print servers wired and or wireless to a typical wireless router </s>
<s> you just need to ensure that the wireless print server is compatible with your printer compatible with your wireless router and is in range of the wireless router </s>
<s> you got the situation correct </s>
<s> i am currently using a linksys wireless routher a linksys wireless printer server with the upstairs printer and a epson printer </s>
<s> the system works great </s>
<s> i just want to expand my capabilitie to the downstars printer </s>
<s> i have a epson r300 down </s>
<s> how would i hook this up </s>
<s> would i use another linksys print server hooked to the epson r300 as a stand alone print server </s>
<s> mike thanks </s>
<s> yes you have the situation correct </s>
<s> so if i buy another wireless print server linksys wireless print server like the one i already have 802 11g and connect to a compatable printer epson r300 or hp 5440 i can print wireless downstairs from my wireless network upstairs as a stand alone </s>
<s> thanks for the advise </s>
<s> mike </s>
<s> when you connect a printer to a network the printer becomes a network resource available for use by the computers on the network </s>
<s> it doesn t matter whether you connect the printer via wired or wireless print server </s>
<s> thanks i am going to buy another print server and see if i can connect my epson downstairs wireless as a stand alone </s>
<s> i m not sure how to do this </s>
<s> i suppose i can call linksys for tech support </s>
<s> take a deep breath and smile </s>
<s> one thing you can do is download and read the quick install instructions for the particular wireless print server you are considering </s>
<s> i m not necessarily recommending this brand or particular model but you might benefit from taking a look at its quick install manual to give you an idea about the level of difficulty involved </s>
<s> a linksys wireless g print server there are also less expensive models from other companies that may work with your equipment </s>
<s> thanks i am already running a linksys printserver with my system upstair </s>
<s> i print to the upstairs printer from my laptop downstarirs </s>
<s> i guess where i am still confused is if i hook another linksys ps to my downstairs printer it will be a total stand alone </s>
<s> can i then print through my wireless links router from the up stairs setup with my wireless laptop </s>
<s> i don t think linksys make that very clear in the install instructions </s>
<s> that is the general idea with any print server </s>
<s> if you can connect a print server to a router then any printer you connect to the print server will be available for any computer that is also connected to the router </s>
<s> the router doesn t care how you connect a print server to it you can use a network cable or a wireless signal </s>
<s> the wireless signal performs the same function as a network cable </s>
<s> wired print server wireless router print server printer wireless print server wireless router wireless print server printer key network cable wireless signal there are two ways to use a wireless print server </s>
<s> infrastructure mode connects the wireless print server to the wireless router via wireless signal </s>
<s> ad hoc mode connects the wireless print server directly to the wireless network adapter of a computer also via wireless signal </s>
<s> you can set it up either way </s>
<s> infrastructure mode is represented in the above diagrams </s>
<s> if you want more information on that linksys wireless print server just click on user guide in the link i provided earlier </s>
<s> the cable between the print servers and the printers is a usb or parallel cable and not a network cable as indicated in the key </s>
