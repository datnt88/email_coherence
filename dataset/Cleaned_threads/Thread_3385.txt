<s> they are in so many feet of your router </s>
<s> try this </s>
<s> enable mac filtering change the wep key and disable management over the wifi link </s>
<s> also turn off the wifi or router when you don t need it </s>
<s> that alone will send them away since they won t know if they can get on or when </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have tried them all not practically effective </s>
<s> i know that when a person access my net he is transmitting </s>
<s> i am thinking of some equipment which can indicate the direction and the distance the transmission is coming from </s>
<s> this would help to narrow down the possible culprits </s>
<s> what would be the cheapest equipment which can do this </s>
<s> wl </s>
<s> why isn t turning off the wifi effective </s>
<s> more important than tracking the intruder is to stop the intruder from continuing to access your network </s>
<s> the first thing you need to do is dump wep </s>
<s> wep is hiddeously insecure and can be and as you found out frequently is trivially hacked </s>
<s> in fact the fbi did it in 3 minutes using kismet airodump airplay and aircrack </s>
<s> the proccess is not very complicated and the above listed tools are readily available </s>
<s> you really need to move to wpa2 if your equiptment will support it or at least wpa with a randomly generated sufficient complex passphrase </s>
<s> now the bad news wpa wpa2 has a vulnerability as well </s>
<s> you do not want to use a short passphrase consisting of a word found in the dictionary </s>
<s> this will leave you vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack a type of brute force attack where words found in the dictionary are thrown against a passprase to recover the passphrase by someone using kismac or cowpatty </s>
<s> two popular wireless hacking tools that are also freely available you will want to use a randomly generated complex passphrase consisting of at least 34 characters </s>
<s> most publications say 20 characters but you get about 2 5n bits of security per character 12 bits 2 5n 12 total in a passphrase </s>
<s> so this would only give you 62 bits of equivelent security </s>
<s> bare minimum you want want 96 bits of security so 34 characters will give you a total 97 bits </s>
<s> ideally you will want to use a 64 digit hexadecimal </s>
<s> this will give you a full 256 bits of security plus using a 64 digit hex avoids the hashing process used to create the 256 bit pairwise master key because the hex is used directly as the key </s>
<s> it is this hashing process specifically the mic hash value that leaves wpa wpa2 vulnerable to a dictionary attack when short dictionary words are used as the passphrase </s>
<s> now the good news </s>
<s> the brute force dictionary attack is the only known effective attack against wpa wpa2 </s>
<s> if you use a 64 digit hex you will make your network reasonably secure against any sort of brute force attack in that each of the 2 256 possibilities must be tried since your passphrase can not be found in a dictionary </s>
<s> this is a huge number 1 1579208923731619542357098500 869x10 77 or in decimal format 1 157 920 892 373 161 954 235 709 850 086 900 000 000 00 0 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 now the really good news </s>
<s> to check each of the 2 256 possibilities you would have to have a device that could crack a billion billion keys per second and it would still take you 3 671x10 51 years to check every possibility </s>
<s> 3 671 743 063 080 802 746 815 416 825 491 118 336 290 905 145 409 708 years as you can plainly see this is significantly longer than the 3 minutes it took the fbi to hack wep </s>
<s> now the best news of all </s>
<s> the des cracker deep crack something your local wardriver is not likely to have could only do 90 billion keys a second and would take 4 0769221021355023274397357709461x10 58 years to exhaust all the possibilities </s>
<s> newer devices can do 256 billion keys a second these computing goliaths something your local wardriver is even less likely to have would still take 1 4332929265320125369905321069732x10 58 years to exhaust the possibilities </s>
<s> the two most popular tools kismac and cowpatty something your local wardriver is likely to have can do 100 and 60 keys per second respectively </s>
<s> now this can actually be subtantially increased to around 76 000 keys a second using precomputed hashes and very large dictionary files again readily available </s>
<s> but 76 000 still falls way short of even the des cracker and precomputed hashes in a dictionary attack are of no use if your ssid hash is not in the hash file and your password is not in the dictionary file </s>
<s> but for the sake of argument it would still take 4 8279340683183580193365292024362x10 64 years to run through all the possibilities </s>
<s> in reality at 100 possibilities per second it would take 3 6692298919219520946957621938515x10 67 years to exhaust the possibilities </s>
<s> so as you can see if you use a sufficiently complex and random passphrase you can have a fairly secure network </s>
<s> if you use something like toast thats exactly what you will be and it will take anywere from 0 2 seconds to around 5 minutes to hack your network </s>
<s> however if you use something like de9350eb9f96d947a962e5c9d71a6f5fc3de5d006bf1340400050d30354af49f a 64 digit hex your would be hacker is going to be busy for quite some time trying to hack your network </s>
<s> if you don t have the means to generate these sort of passowrds you can go to you ll want to get this on a computer that is wired to your network </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> if your equiptment does not support using a 64 digit hex you can still use 63 character randomly generated passphrase like gt 66x gt xc kidz 7 u v c x hl </s>
<s> o gt kc6w6 gt gognb wo quot quot 0adq x yug or 1zuyaqp3yaqsoyjgbru0xwidktm2nwzj6izvlcarl0c4zekgyneec7zqmkrsyz6 but be aware that this will only provide 169 5 bits of equivelent security </s>
<s> so this leaves only 1 0582402237152498756263674716231x10 51 possibilities to check </s>
<s> at a billion billion keys per second it will take your hacker only 33 533 609 137 426 479 695 108 863 5 3 35336091374264796951088635x10 24 years to crack your passphrase by brute force </s>
<s> by the way the age of the universe is believed to be 15 billion years 1 5x10 10 </s>
<s> so as you can see it is possible to keep intruders at bay with a reasonable amount of effort </s>
<s> there is no such thing as bullet proof </s>
<s> remeber it used to be computationally infeasable to brute force des and now it can be done in hours </s>
<s> what is impossible today may be child s play tomorrow </s>
<s> but for now use randomly generated complex passphrase 64 bit hex or 63 character ascii with wpa wpa2 and your would be hacker is probably only going to waste only so much time on your network and go in search of a softer mark </s>
<s> thks for all the info </s>
<s> i agree with your suggestion </s>
<s> will go for a new card which can support wpa wpa2 </s>
