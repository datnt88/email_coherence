<s> pentium 4 2 4 ghz os windows xp video card 7600 gs each time i m going in intervideo home theater the recording software with the installation cd or virtual dub to try recording my computer freezes </s>
<s> i have remove sp2 you need sp2 to install everything and reinstall it and it s still not working </s>
<s> the light on the gamebridge is green it means it is ready to record </s>
<s> i have the gamebridge tv avc 1410 from adaptec </s>
<s> here s what i would install </s>
<s> the motherboard chipset drivers </s>
<s> i was hoping for a make and model on the machine or motherboard so i could provide a direct link </s>
<s> but since there is none this is all i can offer </s>

<s> cpu type intel pentium 4 2400 mhz 18 x 133 motherboard name viarama u8668 pro motherboard chipset via vt8751 apollo p4m266 video card nvidia geforce 7600 gs 256 mb audio via ac 97 enhanced audio controller </s>
<s> is that what you used </s>
<s> it s for via chipset so i thik it s going to work even if it is written via hyperion pro drivers are suitable for any via chipset but they are particularly recommended for kt4 series p4x4 series and newer </s>
<s> do i install them all </s>
<s> via chipset inf update utility v3 00a via agp driver 4 60a via pata ide driver package v1 80 a </s>
<s> i ve installed them all and guess what it s still not working </s>
<s> now that we have the motherboard chipset drivers out of the way sorry it took so long we now have to turn our attention to what else could be causing the lockup </s>
<s> it could be the use of a front port </s>
<s> i read your post again but can t find the gritty details </s>
<s> try the rear motherboard usb connection </s>
<s> sorry if such details are needed but as you suspect when i work with the machine in the flesh i don t have to ask </s>
<s> next we look in the event viewer and research drivers for the video and audio </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ve tried other usb ports already and the samething happen </s>
<s> i m in the event viewer now there is aplication security system </s>
<s> while it does answer a question about ports you didn t share much else </s>
<s> i have to decline teaching how to use event viewer </s>
<s> you can catch up on that with google com bob </s>
<s> what do you need me to write show you </s>
<s> because it s always saying use auxsource </s>
<s> this is not like tech support </s>
<s> you must dig in create posts that detail your issue and post quot information quot this is all volunteer so i won t work hard on fixing your issue </s>
