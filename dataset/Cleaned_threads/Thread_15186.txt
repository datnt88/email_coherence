<s> i don t have any kind of technical background with computers so your help is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i am getting into video editing and just got powerdirector 9 our current laptops could run it but i would rather use a beefier machine that can handle it with ease </s>
<s> in addition to that the computer would mostly be used for simple internet browsing and microsoft office 2010 beyond </s>
<s> we would like to store all of our photos on there as well </s>
<s> without any true computing knowledge i do not know how much computer i really need </s>
<s> i would like to keep the total package under 1 000 </s>
<s> any guidance assistance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i can post additional information if it is needed </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> for video editing you will need a computer with a lot of memory at least 500gb i would recommend a 1tb terrabyte hard drive </s>
<s> a fast processor a 2ghz at the minimum graphics card optical drive with write capability and some expansion slots for future upgrades </s>
<s> you can get one for under 1 000 but you will find that quality desktops capable of editing large movies will run over your budget </s>
<s> you don t have much computing expierience are you comfortable attempting digital editing </s>
<s> as for the digital editing the program i got is called power director 9 it had very good reviews and the demo was easy to use </s>
<s> i am pretty good with user friendly software just not tech specs </s>
<s> to be honest most of this editing will just be photos and not actual video i would be creating dvd slideshows set to music with some graphical overlays and or transitions but i don t plan on much beyond that </s>
<s> what kind of processor does that put me in </s>
<s> 2ghz makes sense but what i struggle with is intel vs athlon vs </s>
<s> i just don t know </s>
<s> i was thinking probably 1tb of memory so that sounds good </s>
<s> other specs though </s>
<s> are there any particular brands i should or shouldn t check out </s>
<s> i know this is subjective but i have no frame of reference and need input </s>
<s> thanks so much for the response </s>
<s> hi ray well i must be honest i am not too familiar with editing software so i am going to give you some general advice that should help you </s>
<s> since you are creating dvd slide shows you will need an optical drive with writable capability </s>
<s> if you can afford it you should get one that will write to both standard dvd s and blu ray </s>
<s> this will allow you to produce dvd s for a wider variety of players important if your selling these </s>
<s> also look for a term called lightscribe </s>
<s> lightscribe is a method of burning data into dvds </s>
<s> it also allows you to quot print quot artwork directly onto a dvd vs having to print out a label and sticking it onto the dvd later </s>
<s> this is what the pros use and it will give your dvd s a more professional quality </s>
<s> it doesn t add much more to the cost anyway </s>
<s> processors are a different matter </s>
<s> you want the best processor you can afford </s>
<s> both intel and atheon make good processors </s>
<s> i would recommend no less than an intel i5 core processor as your minimum or the atheon equivelant </s>
<s> the processor is like your computers brain and the faster the processor the faster your computer </s>
<s> also make sure that your computer has the appropriate connections for whatever your using to record your pics movies </s>
<s> i would recommend no fewer that 4 usb ports </s>
<s> be nice if it came with an esata port but i don t think that is essential esata ports are going to be the usb replacements and are much faster that the current usb ports </s>
<s> if you will be using a camcorder take a look at the cables that came with it and make sure the computer can accomadate them </s>
<s> if the computer comes with a graphics card it should be able to </s>
<s> make sure you have a graphics card </s>
<s> i will be honest you will have to trust the salesman on this as i don t know too much about graphics cards </s>
<s> again you will need to get the best you can afford as that will make your editing easier </s>
<s> as far as computer brands go almost all of the major brands are good </s>
<s> i don t know too much about the systemax brand other than they sell for cheap </s>
<s> i would stay away from them </s>
<s> dell lenovo ibm apple hp etc </s>
<s> are all good </s>
<s> i will say that everyone i know that works in video photography has strongly recommended apple and they use apple computers for their editing </s>
<s> might look into those but they will be expensive </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> thank you again for your response </s>
<s> that gives me a good place to start </s>
<s> i don t plan on selling an dvd s though that could be a good business opportunity </s>
<s> it is more for family friend purposes </s>
<s> i will be making the slideshow for my upcoming wedding with the software and may do the same for other friends getting married soon </s>
<s> i m at the age where our families start to grow too so i m sure i can use the software to chronicle those memories as well </s>
<s> if a business springs out of it great </s>
<s> i did consider apple but i really want to stick with a pc </s>
<s> i can t stand using microsoft office on a mac and i will be using that fairly frequently as well </s>
<s> i think the software i have will be more than adequate for my purposes and should be fine on the pc </s>
<s> thanks for that suggestion though </s>
<s> again thank you for the input and i will get to looking around </s>
<s> much appreciated </s>
