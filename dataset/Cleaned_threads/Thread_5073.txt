<s> please help </s>
<s> my pc keeps re booting and i couldn t resolve this </s>
<s> i just got my pc motherboad upgraded with the following abit nf7 s nforce2 agp8x ddr400 sata raid 1394 lan amd mb and athlon xp3000 512mb ddr400 and it s using an old video card and ide 40gb hard disk innovision inno3d tornado geforce2 mx400 64mb the system is running on win xp pro </s>
<s> sometimes it will re boot after loading the personal settings </s>
<s> and sometimes it reboot before seeing the window setup page </s>
<s> what could be the possible problem </s>
<s> anyone can help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if it keeps rebooting go to my computer and do a right click then properties then advanced then setting under startup and recover then under system failure unclick automatically restart </s>
<s> normally its a driver problem so now you might get a blue screen and it should tell you what problem you have hope it helps germansal </s>
<s> can you get to your desktop at all </s>
<s> does your system sometimes freeze up </s>
<s> what were you doing when the problem first started or was it this way as soon as the upgrade </s>
<s> if there are not any freeze ups i don t believe its a driver problem </s>
<s> i think it could be a memory problem or cpu problem </s>
<s> go into your bios and find your memory readings </s>
<s> make sure they read right </s>
<s> look at your clock speed and see if it is right and also check the tempature of your cpu </s>
<s> it could be running too hot </s>
<s> it may also be not seated right </s>
<s> the heatsink and fan may not be seated right </s>
<s> did you reload xp after the upgrade </s>
<s> did you download sp2 </s>
<s> give more details </s>
<s> it could be a lot of things </s>
<s> maybe even a virus </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> hi skip thanks for responding </s>
<s> sometimes it keeps re booting so many times that i didn t even get to see the desktop at all </s>
<s> the system freeze up at detecting the ide hard disk when before this there is a series of re boots </s>
<s> it will also re boot itself when i am on the desktop </s>
<s> when this happens i will be prompt to start up at safe mode </s>
<s> and it re boot itself even when i try starting it up at safe mode </s>
<s> after the upgrade i formatted my old 3 yr old 40gb ide hard disk which is running on win98 </s>
<s> and install xp with sp1 </s>
<s> i have not downloaded sp2 </s>
<s> i had installed a 15 day trial norton antivirus 2005 to temporarily prevent any virus infection </s>
<s> when you say the heatsink and fan may not be seated right do you mean that it is not installed properly on the motherboard </s>
<s> would it be any case of irq conflict </s>
<s> i notice that 2 or 3 drivers are sharing 1 irq or memory address </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> hi germansal thanks for responding </s>
<s> yes i tried what you had recommended and the following message is prompted </s>
<s> quot a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer </s>
<s> if this is the first time you ve seen this stop error screen restart your computer </s>
<s> if this screen appears again follow these steps check to be sure you have adequate disk space </s>
<s> if a driver is identified in the stop message disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates </s>
<s> try changing video adapters </s>
<s> check with your hardware vendor for any bios updates </s>
<s> disable bios memory options such as caching or shadowing </s>
<s> if you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components restart your computer press f8 to select advanced startup options and then select safe mode </s>
<s> technical information stop 0x0000008e 0xc0000005 0x8053dd91 0xf897cf74 0x00000000 beginning dump of physical memory physical memory dump complete </s>
<s> contact your system administrator or technical support group for further assistance </s>
<s> quot i don t quite understand what is to be done from the above message </s>
<s> could you advice </s>
<s> thanks a million </s>
<s> gl </s>
<s> try going to the bios and hit default setting and see if that works </s>
<s> to get into the bios hit the f1 or the del button after you turn the computer on </s>
<s> but be carefully the bios is nothing to play around with if you don t know what you are doing good luck </s>
<s> i think were both on the right track </s>
<s> has this been a problem ever since your upgrade </s>
<s> if so i still believe it is heat related </s>
<s> it will also give you a blue screen to protect your computer </s>
<s> try what gl said and see if it works but in addition to delete or f1 to get in your bios i have seen some computers use f2 and all the way up to f8 </s>
<s> you can also try to clear your bios memory by manually changing your jumper on the motherboard </s>
<s> refer to this in your motherboard manual </s>
<s> we ll get to the bottom of this </s>
<s> mean while i will try to look up your error number on the net </s>
<s> talk to you soon </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> your fix may be in sp2 </s>
<s> from what i have read </s>
<s> you can try it and if it doesn t work you can uninstall it </s>
<s> if your system will let you get that far without rebooting </s>
<s> try to reset bios first then try removing memory modules if you have more than one </s>
<s> if you have 2 or 3 take them all out and try putting one in at a time in the first slot and try booting with one </s>
<s> do this with each one </s>
<s> if thats not the problem try to uninstall your video driver and reinstall it or look for an upgrade at the manufacturer </s>
<s> if that doesn t work try to get service pack 2 if that doesn t work open a side panel and try blowing a fan inside while booting </s>
<s> if that doesn t work i would wipe the drive clean and reinstall xp </s>
<s> sometimes an install doesn t always setup properly </s>
<s> let me know what you have tried </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> hi skip as i am not familiar with the resetting of bios i have not done the bios reset </s>
<s> however i had attempted to remove the memory modules and replacing it back 1 at a time </s>
<s> it continues to give the same problem </s>
<s> next i uninstall the video driver and reinstall an upgraded one </s>
<s> this time the problem seems to have gone off for a while </s>
<s> i can use it for 2 days </s>
<s> this problem seems to resurface under a particular user account </s>
<s> note i had created a 3 user accounts the other 2 seems to work fine </s>
<s> i had disable the automatic re boot and a blue screen is presented with the problem messages </s>
<s> one of the recommendation is to get the windows update </s>
<s> and i am doing it now </s>
<s> i will continue to monitor if the problem still persists </s>
<s> afterwhich i will perhaps install xp sp2 </s>
<s> and hopefully it could solve the problem </s>
<s> i will keep you posted of the development </s>
<s> by the way i had another piece of the 40gb hard disk and i had tried to reinstall xp </s>
<s> and it just hang and give me a blue screen with similar error messages </s>
<s> hence i don t think reinstalling would help </s>
<s> and thank you for taking the trouble to give me all the advice </s>
<s> gl </s>
<s> if you tried to install windows xp on another partition and it wouldn t load then either your bios needs to be reset or more likely i think the problem is where i started in the beginning </s>
<s> the processor or heatsink fan is not seated right or you are over heating </s>
<s> there is a cmos jumper on your mainboard </s>
<s> your motherboard i mean </s>
<s> it will be shown in the book that came with the board </s>
<s> there are 3 pins with a plastic cap over 2 of the pins </s>
<s> the cap is the jumper </s>
<s> it is small </s>
<s> refer to your book to see where exactly it is on the board </s>
<s> all you need to do is move the cap to pins 1 and 2 for a few seconds and then put the cap back on pins 2 and 3 turn off your power to your computer but don t unplug from the back </s>
<s> the 3 pronged plug is a ground </s>
<s> also hold on to the metal frame with one hand to stay grounded </s>
<s> this prevents static which can harm your computer </s>
<s> after you try sp2 try to reset cmos which is part of your bios </s>
<s> i want you to do this to reset the configurations mostly for your memory </s>
<s> reseting the cmos setting by the jumper will clear the bios memory and set it to default </s>
<s> hope you can understand this </s>
<s> if not let me know and we will take it one step at a time </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> hi skip i tried updating win sp2 but it could not be updated </s>
<s> not sure what is the problem preventing it </s>
<s> next i proceed to resetting the cmos following the instruction stated on the mainboard s installation guidebook </s>
<s> after this the problem still persists </s>
<s> do you have any idea what these 2 messages mean </s>
<s> 1 page_fault_in_nonpaged_area 2 irql_not_less_or_equal these appear on the blue screen how do i check if the processor is overheating </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> gl </s>
<s> what is the power supply </s>
<s> ok this takes us back to probably a driver error or possibly a program you have that is not compatible with xp </s>
<s> what is the exact error code </s>
<s> is it the same error code as before </s>
<s> stop 0x0000008e 0xc0000005 0x8053dd91 0xf897cf74 0x00000000 </s>
<s> if so when you updated your video driver did you uninstall the driver first </s>
<s> the power supply is 400w </s>
<s> i got it upgraded together with the motherboard cpu and ram </s>
<s> hi there buddy appears that u r struggling with this problem for quite some time i have an exactly similar problem on a compaq presario 700 laptop here s what i did a format the drive b install winxp pro c after the install maintain only one account d do not install any drivers at this stage let the system run only on the native windows drivers </s>

<s> however on the positive side i have noticed this problem on quite a few amd machines but hardly never on an intel machine there might be a problem of overheating of the cpu also </s>
<s> i have an older emachine with xp home that is continuously rebooting </s>
<s> it has the config below </s>
<s> i searched for pcdsm30 sys on the net but didn t find any references </s>
