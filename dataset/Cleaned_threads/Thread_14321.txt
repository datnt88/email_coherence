<s> i have an wacom intuos graphics tablet with a serial port connecting cable but i have not serial port on my computer </s>
<s> what kind of serial port to usb adapter can i use to connect the tablet to my computer </s>
<s> the operation system is word 7 </s>
<s> but let me share i ve used hundreds of this model gt the standard unit </s>
<s> it s quite odd to find wacom selling serial port devices in fact i didn t see that on their site </s>
<s> too bad the story and model number is missing but i can write the standard model i noted is great for serial port work </s>
<s> you can find that adapter at newegg and amazon as well </s>
