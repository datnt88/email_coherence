<s> i recently decided to go and purchase an imac because my 3 year old compaq desktop is truely outdated </s>
<s> but now i discovered that mac os x 10 6 snow leopard is on the way </s>
<s> do you think that a new imac or macbook will debue with os x 10 6 when it is released next year </s>
<s> should i buy my imac now or wait </s>
<s> thank you for your advice </s>
<s> rsn real soon now is a devilish issue </s>
<s> i m going to tell you to wait until you can t wait no more </s>
<s> i saved my neighbor s laptop about 5 times and during that time we saw the passing of those horrid pentium 4 laptops and the arrival of the centrino and more mhz to the ghz </s>
<s> by hanging in one more year they not only extended their old laptop by that long but added 2 years to their next laptop s life by skipping what was then being offered </s>
<s> when you can t wait anymore then pull the trigger </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you can count on there being new models whenever a new os ships </s>
<s> if the compaq is annoying it d be fine to replace with imac now </s>
<s> they ve recently been renewed in the sense of getting bigger drives and faster cpus </s>
<s> also a lot of people who run leopard upgraded from earlier versions so i d be willing to wager an upgrade to 10 6 from 10 5 x will be available and pretty easy </s>
