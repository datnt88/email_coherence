<s> i m living temporarily in an apartment complex where one of my neighbors has thoughtfully installed an open wifi access point which i am happy to use </s>
<s> but it doesn t work all the time </s>
<s> sometimes it s fine and sometimes there s no signal at all </s>
<s> but even if i get no reception in my apartment i know the transmitter is on because if i take my laptop down the hall it picks up the neighbor s signal loud and clear </s>
<s> is there a stronger receiving antenna that i can install in my apartment so i can always pick up the neighbor s signal </s>
<s> all the repeaters and extenders i see advertised seem to apply to the sender s location </s>
<s> what if anything can i do as the receiver </s>
<s> did you really think we d help you steal your neighbor s internet access </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> call them and ask them to reboot their access point or turn it back on </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> please research that option a bit more </s>
<s> also you can construct a parabolic reflector from kitchen materials i ve done this at a party and at first they thought i was nuts but afterwards they certified me as what i was never quite sure the dragonfly at is some trick </s>
<s> this is better gt bob </s>
<s> you posted your email address in the clear </s>
<s> spam is the result since these forums are read by robots trolling for just such an entry </s>
<s> do you want me to delete that message for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes please delete the message </s>
<s> i thought i was sending you a message directly and not posting to the site </s>
<s> best lee </s>
