<s> have a look here if your problem is copy protection </s>
<s> please be aware that copying is only legal for personal backup to preserve originals </s>
<s> i m just trying to make back up copies because the boys will mess the origionals up </s>
<s> i ll try the url you sent me </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> could be the downfall for copying dvd movies as well </s>
<s> newer dvd burners dvd players audio players and television sets are all being manufactured that will be able to detect burned illegal copies and won t play them </s>
<s> you either will get nada zip zero on screen or silence in an audio player or you will get a screen saying to put in a new disc because the disc can t be read </s>
<s> before you waste money and time burning dvd s try one and play it immediately to see what results you get on screen or in an audio player </s>
<s> you may be able to play them on your pc but nothing else </s>
<s> making copies of anything copyrighted is illegal in the usa even backup copies </s>
<s> the reason being is that if you can make one copy as a backup you can just as easily make many for pirating </s>
<s> when you consider that even hardware such as a video or sound card is copyrighted there is nothing to stop a hardware maker from charging for newer drivers rather than make them available for free as a download i think some of these copyright laws make no sense at all and they covered too large a canvas with that sweeping brush they used to paint the law in their haste to protect music and movies </s>

<s> glad to be of help </s>
