<s> i recently purchased a linksys e3000 with high anticipation of using the dual band due to my use type </s>
<s> we are avid online rpg gamers eq2 utilize netflix have all 3 major gaming systems etc </s>
<s> surely the dual band capability would benefit us </s>
<s> now the problem </s>
<s> we have 5 laptops a x box 360 a wii a ps3 several i pods smart phones tv tivo etc all of which are connected to the router </s>
<s> the problem is only 1 of the devices has recognized the 5 ghz band the xbox 360 </s>
<s> none of the other items recognize it </s>
<s> i have used the cisco website for troubleshooting and have had no luck </s>
<s> i have a different name for the 5ghz network so it s not a matter of confusion </s>
<s> i have reset the router and updated the drivers on all the computers </s>
<s> there are known issues between the atheros adapaters and e3000 3 of the 5 laptops have ahteros adapaters but i cannot find any issues with the realtek adapters the other 2 laptops and have no idea what type of adapter the other gaming systems and handheld devices are using </s>
<s> the os s on the laptops are xp vista and 7 any other ideas would be great </s>
<s> the linksys online chat support is worthless all they tell me is update my drivers </s>
<s> all your equipment must support 5g and this is uncommon </s>
<s> in addition all your equipment must support n since you can t run b or g over 5g only a your nic s will clearly say they are dual mode when they support 5g </s>
<s> they should have options in the drivers to select only the 5g band </s>
<s> i suspect the equipment that does not work does not support the band </s>
<s> this is the problem with replacing routers with newer ones expecting better performance </s>
<s> you in general must replace everything if you attempt to run a mix of b g and n devices they will get in each others way and you will get poor performance </s>
<s> yeah bill and it can get a little pricey too especially with 5 laptops and gaming devices such as the poster mentioned some and most are not likely compatible with n dual band set up </s>
<s> so it seems i wasted my money on the dual band capability although in all the reviews i read about this router none of them mentioned the compatibility of the network adapter </s>
<s> two of my laptops however are 802 11n and say quot dual band quot however i can t get either of them to recognize the 5 ghz range either </s>
<s> i have never used dual band nics installed inside the laptop only ones that are usb external </s>
<s> i would suspect they work similar </s>
<s> their are settings in the device config in the driver that lets you set all kinds of wireless settings </s>
<s> one option will select the band and it may default to 2 4 you may have to force it to use 5 some adapters have their own little app to set this stuff but i think if you are using windows you must set these from the device manager </s>
<s> kinda depends one of my adapters will scan both 2 4 and 5 and when you select the device to connect to it set all this stuff </s>
<s> the other you have to scan each separately </s>
<s> never tried set them using just the windows network stuff though </s>
<s> i would recommend you run everything that can run on 5g and force the 2 4 to run g only or b only if you have stuff that does not do g even b is more than fast enough for internet surfing </s>
<s> basically as an example if you have a l t with a g antenna and you use an n adapter it will default to g so here we go again with compatibility issues </s>
<s> for gaming a hardwire hook up works generally better than a wifi hook up but there can be issues doing that as well cables hook ups etc </s>
<s> it can get tricky to be sure </s>
