<s> i would like to have my desktop pc interact with my netbook </s>
<s> they are both connected wired to a linksys 2 4 router </s>
<s> what and how is the best way to connect them </s>
<s> when i go to establish a home network it asks if i want to share the printer and folders </s>
<s> i want to share folders but only from one computer to the other not to the internet </s>
<s> i just want two computer to talk to each other </s>
<s> from each machine you control the level of access </s>
<s> since only you know the operating system of each machine you ll have to dig a little </s>
<s> thank you for your response </s>
<s> i tried to set up both computers but nothing happened </s>
<s> i do not have much patience when it is something that does not matter one way or the other so i gave up </s>
<s> just have too much time on my hands </s>
<s> if you don t have the patience why not have this done for you </s>
<s> call up some local talent and tell them what you want done </s>
<s> then have them tell you when it s working so you don t have to wait or invest personal time in the effort </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for your suggestion </s>
<s> i continued to play around with this set up and discovered that on the desktop i can access the netbook by accessing the quot workgroup quot </s>
<s> on the netbook i can access the desktop with quot network places quot </s>
<s> i do not know if that is the best or correct way but i have been able to transfer data and that is what i wanted to do </s>
<s> when i delete a folder in the quot share document quot folder it does not delete the original does it </s>
<s> make a backup copy to another folder and then delete one </s>
<s> the shared document when deleted does delete the original here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for the suggestions </s>
<s> i found out the hard way about deleting but was able to recover it </s>
<s> i think i am getting the hang of this </s>
