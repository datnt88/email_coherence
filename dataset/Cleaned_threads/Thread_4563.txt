<s> i am having a problem with this burner </s>
<s> i m using dvdfab 6 to burn movies the drive reads the movie just fine but when it gets to the stage of burning the temp file the drive won t recognize the blank media </s>
<s> it s a dual layer and i ve tried ridata and maxell discs but still no recognition </s>
<s> can anyone shed some light on this </s>
<s> i m using amd athlon 3000 2 1 ghz windows xp </s>
<s> you tried other new drives </s>
<s> i think it s the dvdfab6 problem </s>
<s> go download imgburn here on cnet and give it a try </s>
<s> i see there are discussions about this if i use google </s>
<s> notes an easy thing to try and a fine example of how folk want easy friendly answers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s not the dvdfab software </s>
<s> i have a laptop with an external drive that does just great with dvdfab </s>
<s> there s some other reason the nec drive isn t reading the discs </s>
<s> i went to the nec website to check for compatibility and they gave two other brands fuji and phillips </s>
<s> i guess i ll try those and if they don t work either i ll need more feedback on this issue </s>
<s> it a one way of trouble shooting the problem </s>
<s> if you don t think it s the software then it must be the hardware and burner are not that expensive </s>
<s> good luck </s>
