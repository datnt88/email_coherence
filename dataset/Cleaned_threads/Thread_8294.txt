<s> robert explained what needs to be done </s>
<s> i just like to offer you must be 100 sure what you have </s>
<s> if you have a true mobile or laptop only cpu setup it just can t be swapped in most cases </s>
<s> also you may have a supported cpu but your quot setup quot is mounted on some laptop pcb or such that the cpu is soldered to and not socketed </s>
<s> until you can see and hold in your hand the cpu itself and look at it s quot stock number quot after cleaning the cpu package will it all make sense </s>
