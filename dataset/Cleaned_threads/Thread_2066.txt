<s> i recently bought an external hd with both firewire and usb 2 0 interfaces </s>
<s> i asked my dealer which was faster since the actual spec seemed to indicate that the usb was faster </s>
<s> he said fw was faster since it did not use as much cpu horsepower </s>
<s> well i got it home and did a basic bench test nothing fancy just reading data from the hard disk and timing it </s>
<s> i took 2 minutes 50 seconds to read about 2 5 gb of data from the disk using the usb interface and about 10 seconds less using the fw interface to read the same data </s>
<s> i was reading from the new external drive and writing to my internal hd </s>
<s> so what is the deal </s>
<s> they both appear similar </s>
<s> it is maybe that the fw is better when the cpu is busy multi tasking with other jobs </s>
<s> my test was run with nothing else running on the system </s>
<s> otherwise i don t really see that much difference in throughput </s>
<s> pc </s>
<s> use usb 2 0 apple </s>
<s> use firewire </s>
<s> i can t explain why one is stable on one platform and not the other but to avoid extension tests for possible data loss this is how i hook such up </s>
<s> your choice of course </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am using a toshiba m30 notebook </s>
<s> i meant quot extensive tests quot i see no reason to find out if firewire is stable today for hard disk use on a pc </s>
<s> you are more than welcome to perform tests </s>
