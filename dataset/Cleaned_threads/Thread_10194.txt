<s> the question is pretty self explanatory </s>
<s> i d like to know if there is a difference between what is considered quot shared memory quot and what is considered quot shared video memory quot </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> depends on the what you mean with shared memory </s>
<s> shared between what </s>
<s> can you provide a link where it s used in the sense you mean </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> if you don t have actual quot dedicated memory quot on some device then whatever device usually video is using system memory for it needs </s>
<s> it will use what it needs or expands on what it already has </s>
<s> no matter any quot shared quot memory from actual system memory installed gets used </s>
<s> if you increase system memory do so it usually does better qand if shared presents a larger memory resource </s>
<s> don t confuse the term quot memory quot for a stored media device which in turn gets used as memory as well </s>
<s> this is generally speaking some type of quot virtual memory quot on a temporary basis </s>
<s> however as already asked of you in what way has the terms shared and shared video come to light </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> response was asked at vapcmd </s>
