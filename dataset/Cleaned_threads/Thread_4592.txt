<s> i am looking for a new pc </s>
<s> i have been researching and found that several people are having problems with live tv freezing or locking up their system </s>
<s> no one seems to know what the root cause is </s>
<s> some theories are the duel core processor the tuner and an amd processor </s>
<s> the list goes on </s>
<s> are there new pc s that have a tv tuner that does not lock up </s>
<s> thank you for your help </s>
<s> a properly configured machine doing that </s>
<s> it s usually a pebkac error </s>
<s> users will try to do something they either shouldn t or can t or hose up their machines with a gazillion running programs in the background or they expect too much out of a pc that just barely meets requirements or are filled with adware spyware trojans etc </s>
<s> as i said a properly configured and clean machine will perform as advertised </s>
<s> pebkac problem exists between keyboard and chair </s>
<s> i agree with the pebkac theory with some </s>
<s> but some of these posts tell a different story </s>
<s> thanks for looking into this </s>
<s> but i think i d shy away from gateway </s>
<s> but part of the travails of pcs are driver issues and maybe a machine that has issues with heat or quot other quot </s>
<s> a proper machine will not lock up on use of a tv card </s>
<s> it seems that we are expected to fix issues with vendors that don t deliver the machine ready to use </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for the feedback </s>
<s> i am looking for a pc that i can edit homemade camcorder video and must have a reliable tv tuner </s>
<s> i thought gateway was good however i am open to suggestions </s>
<s> about an hp </s>
<s> the hp m7360n seems like a loaded pc </s>
<s> does hp have a good service record </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> but i am fairly adept at finding current drivers and avoiding heat or power issues </s>
<s> what i was alluding to was that today s vendors and more are leaving it to us to sort drivers and such out while that other maker seems to take a different approach </s>
<s> this may not be an option for those that must run windows </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hp compaq is pretty good i ve had several over the years and zero problems today i build my own </s>
<s> the latest article i read in pcworld magazine showed that ibm levono rated highest in customer satisfaction and reliability </s>
<s> which is why i own an ibm thinkpad </s>
<s> again </s>
<s> wayne there are 10 types of people who understand binary those that do and those that don t </s>
<s> click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about telephones internet connections spyware removal and download free software </s>
<s> i think i have settled into the hp7360n </s>
<s> it should handle my home movie editing and vhs transfers </s>
<s> with the few reviews posted on this site it seems that the tv tuner works well unlike the gateways </s>
<s> i bought a seperate monitor that has dvi capability </s>
<s> is it possible to upgrade the hp7360n to accept dvi </s>
<s> secondly would dvi make that much of a difference for watching vidos and tv </s>
<s> thanks for the link to your web site </s>
<s> some great downloads there </s>
<s> and some great reference for me seeing that i am incharge of the phone system at work </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
