<s> i recently acquired an old powerspec pc model 7670 that i want to use as a simple home file server </s>
<s> i want to stick a couple of 400 gb sata harddrives and a raid controller card in and i also think i ll need to upgrade the 150w power supply i ve removed the floppy extra cd rom drives </s>
<s> this is the one that s in the system now i m thinking i just need a 300 400w power supply plus either no fan or silent running fan but i m not quite sure what to look for </s>
<s> all products on newegg seem like the atx version might not be compatible with such an old system </s>
<s> based on some research i think i could get by with an atx 12v 1 x unit or perhaps older would work </s>
<s> i m just wondering what exactly i should look for if anyone had any suggestions and what sites would be good for looking up purchasing an older power supply </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i see what looks like a bog standard atx supply </s>
<s> today s newer atx 12v units even with the newer 24 pin atx connection let me slip off the 4 pins and it s back to 20 pin atx </s>
<s> all that you need to do is check the mechanical or quot does it fit quot bob </s>
<s> 24 pin connector that separates into a 20 4 should work </s>
<s> if used for a server running 24 7 365 pay attention to efficiency as cheap psus are not usually efficient power wise </s>
<s> getting a better quality high reliability high efficiency psu would be the way i d go </s>
<s> psus that meet the aforementioned criteria should be easy to find online or at your favorite local vendor </s>
