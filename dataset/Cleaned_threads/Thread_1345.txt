<s> hi everyone </s>
<s> i m planning to get a new gpu next week so i just wanted to take your advice on it </s>
<s> my system configuration is phenom iix4 945 3 0 ghz ga 880gm ud2h 4 gigs of ram gpu integrated hd4250 windows7 x32 since i live in india i have a budget in my currency that would be equal to around 250 300 </s>
<s> i ve been doing a lot of research and found that 6870 is a pretty good deal but then again the hunger of power never stops so i checked out 6950 and 6970 but they kind of cross my budget </s>
<s> i also check gtx560 ti and noticed that it is slightly better in performance than 6870 and perhaps on par with the 6950 and 560ti is cheaper than 6950 i m pretty confused and can t decide the best deal for myself so i seek advice </s>
<s> i use a monitor with a native resolution of 1600x900 and i d really like it if all the heavy games crysis just cause 2 run smoothly at least 40fps </s>
<s> please feel free to suggest anything you may like </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> what you could do is to head to tomshardware com find the cheapest card on your list and see the test results </s>
<s> you set a specification of 40 fps and the reviews often show that in games during the test </s>
<s> seems all you need to do is finish your research </s>
<s> and about power </s>
<s> be sure to see if any mention of the power requirement in watts or amperes is noted </s>
<s> a sad thing i encounter a lot is the new upgrader the person buys a card but the machine s power supply is too small </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have a cooler master 550gx smpu good enough i guess </s>
<s> sorry no one could know if that s good enough </s>
<s> for example someone could have a pc with 20 hard drives on it as well or what else </s>
<s> there are plenty of power supply discussions and estimators out there but i can t answer this question given such details so far </s>
<s> and even if i had all the parts in the system it still comes with a disclaimer about the health of the parts and the ambient temperature </s>
<s> i think you have some research to do </s>
