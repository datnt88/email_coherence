<s> i m a big tron nerd so was really looking at the tron keyboard by razer but it appears to be a terrible keyboard unless you only want to look at it </s>
<s> bummer </s>
<s> i got to thinking though i really do need a new keyboard </s>
<s> i m not an expert but i believe i need a mechanical keyboard </s>
<s> i see a lot of discussion about quot cherry quot and quot switches quot </s>
<s> i can type pretty fast and am beginning to see how inefficient my old microsoft keyboard is and how hard i have to press to type </s>
<s> i m looking for effortless and responsive typing </s>
<s> i do a ton of typing and want high end all around great typing </s>
<s> that being said i want it to look outstanding as well </s>
<s> cool lighting is much preferred </s>
<s> so far the only keyboard i have found online to be mechanical and have neat lighting is the black widow ultimate but again i am not an expert and can use any and all advice you all have on keyboards </s>
<s> please let me know what is out there that would be good for me </s>
<s> i appreciate the help </s>
<s> jwhyrock </s>
<s> has a few models </s>
<s> although they are really designed with gaming in mind i really like the logitech g series of keyboards </s>
<s> there is a g15 g11 and some new ones </s>
<s> i have the g11 </s>
<s> the keyboard has a nice feel to type on not clicky buttons but not soft and squidgey either </s>
<s> they allow you to turn off the lights have them dimmed or full brightness </s>
<s> one of the main reasons they are gaming keyboards is because they come with extra programmable shortcut buttons but i find these useful out of games </s>
<s> i write a lesson plan every week for school and it is in essentially the same style each time </s>
<s> so i simply have the shortcut buttons set up linked to macros </s>
<s> i have the first 6 buttons linked to sentences that i use often in the document </s>
<s> for example i use quot the children develop quot all the time so that is key g6 </s>
<s> i hit that in word it types it right out for me </s>
<s> i have 2 other buttons set up to auto format </s>
<s> so i highlight some text hit g10 and it formats the size font and bold settings to my standard </s>
<s> these button also have three memory settings so you could set up on group of shortcuts for word another for excel and a third for outlook or something and simply switch between them at the touch of a button </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
