<s> has your hard drive s failed on you before </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> how so and were you able to recover the data </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> lucky you </s>
<s> anything you want to share about your luck </s>
<s> not yet but i m starting to encounter some problems now </s>
<s> what problems and have you backed up your data </s>
<s> share your experience with us if your hard drive has failed on you before </s>
<s> let us know what the end results were was your data recoverable if yes how was it recovered or was it lost forever </s>
<s> on my web server </s>
<s> i back up my site regularly to dvd and external hd </s>
<s> and every month or so i clone the entire drive to another external drive </s>
<s> bummer that it failed but inserting the cloned drive put the system back on line in minutes and adding the backups was easy </s>
<s> i don t go for the backup software </s>
<s> i also clone my main pc drive to yet another external drive </s>
<s> recovery is ten times faster and simpler than restoring a backup </s>
<s> a friend who is a real techie put it in the freezer </s>
<s> then because he is very good and very fast he installed the frozen hard drive into his computer and recovered and saved the info to another hard drive </s>
<s> then he fixed it good enough to store info and things like game patches </s>
<s> i run ghost12 on my pc and acronis10 on my laptop both are image backup utilities so if either hard drive were to fail i could be up and running in 36 minutes </s>
<s> how do i know this </s>
<s> well i did a test run on the pc </s>
<s> i purchased a new hard drive took out the working one put in the new one and did the image transfer </s>
<s> i am still working from that image backup hd </s>
<s> the initial hd i re formatted and used it as my external backup hd for acronis on my laptop </s>
<s> i know both acronis and ghost cost money but for me a great investment and over time very reasonably priced i think </s>
<s> so i suggest you use image software then never worry about hard drive failure at all </s>
<s> fortunately i always keep disk image backups and store multiple copies of important data on separate machines external media and online </s>
<s> paragon drive backup express is free for personal use </s>
<s> get it here </s>
<s> the only time my hdd failed was on a then 12 year old toshiba sat pro 400 cdt </s>
<s> didn t bother fixing it since i didn t have any important data on it except for dark forces and doom </s>
<s> first i had the hard disk on my dell optiplex break no notice it just stopped working </s>
<s> the computer was just used for web browsing so no important files to loose </s>
<s> just last week my 3 month old external hard disk broke and the bad part is that it was the actual drive not the casing circuits </s>
<s> i had just reformatted my laptop and this was where all of my archived files were </s>
<s> i just hope hitachi will send me a replacement and i can find some software to recover the files </s>
<s> lost the hard drive in a not quite 3 yr old hp </s>
<s> luckily had the extended warranty with geek squad </s>
<s> they replaced the hard drive but due to gs first telling me it was a software problem i took the cpu to another company firedog </s>
<s> the 2nd company was able to recover my hard drive and then i took the cpu back to gs to have it replaced </s>
<s> then back to firedog to have them reinstall the information they burned to a cd </s>
<s> luckily i m not into downloading music or storing photos so much of my material was text </s>
<s> i made a mistake downloaded sp 2 for my pc running xt after i installed it however i started having stop errors as many as 10 times in one day </s>
<s> pointing at everything in the pc </s>
<s> dell eventually replaced the drive </s>
<s> i ordered sp2 on cd from microsoft but it took me several months to work up enough courage to try to install from the cd d 8144 id so finally never had another problem </s>
<s> rich </s>
<s> it was a new seagate barracuda 320gb 3mths old sata seemed to be a spate of these at one point which quickly tailed off it was a platter defect i believe after a normal shut down it lost the boot sector and mbr i was unable to restore either and had quite a bit of stuff i did not have duplicated on other drives in some form so after a spinrite session which found the data areas to be fine and no luck with free recovery applications i bought a copy of seagate s recovery software </s>
<s> found all my files and then some internet cache except for a few mp3s the data was intact </s>
<s> i then nuked the drive and tried a clean install on it it failed right after the 1st reboot so it got rma d </s>
<s> paid a lot of money for a raid 1 if your main drive goes bad slowly you will lose the mirror </s>
<s> it happened to me twice </s>
<s> viruses take both out also i know duh but the point is cannot use either to get the data off </s>
<s> i lost both to a power surge lightening strike while the machine was off </s>
<s> now i have an internal 3rd drive using norton and backing up the raid also two external drives which i alternate and backup the files </s>
<s> i used the refrigerator trick and it worked also sent one out for recovery and 500 later got most of the data back </s>
<s> the biggest pain reregistering software bought on line find the old emails contacting the companies </s>
<s> the very worst ptc engineering software it took me weeks to get it installed and reconnected back into the server </s>
<s> some software upgrades require the loading of previous versions mathcad and pinnacle have to go back 3 versions </s>
<s> as much as i hate it i buy the cd backups or you can spend weeks re downloading everything </s>
<s> sure getting the data back is important but having to reload everything to include all the updates is insane mirror is the way to go </s>
<s> if you are using raid 0 get ready the data is split between the drives so what you actually retrieve is a crap shoot unless you really pay attention so which drive goes out </s>
<s> you are about to enter the twilite zone </s>
<s> three times in the company i worked for </s>
<s> they were not happy when i insisted that they buy a new hard drive to replace the one s that failed but when i got back all the data on the drives they were thrilled </s>
<s> i used file scavenger </s>
<s> i took a computer with a quot blown quot drive home used a new hard drive in a hard case making it a second hard drive and ran it overnight </s>
<s> no one noticed any difference </s>
<s> and after i did a format several times on the quot blown quot drives they worked a charm so the purchase of the new drives was not so much the blow to the budget they thought </s>
<s> i used those drives to back up the idiots who lost the drives in the first place iic did not want me to back up anything but the server </s>
<s> now that i m gone i hear the entire server when belly up second time in two years and i am so glad i m not there anymore </s>
<s> i ve tried spin right on new boss computer but didn t work file scavenger did the work for me </s>
<s> new that boss has a quot blown quot drive and the people she s hired has said get a new computer </s>
<s> well she simply cannot afford that right now </s>
<s> i m telling her that i can try to get her drive back </s>
<s> plus she has two other computers just sitting there </s>
<s> the tech she hired told her they are quot too full quot to be rescued </s>
<s> baloney </s>
<s> get rid of all the stuff those folks downloaded music mostly and they will be just fine </s>
<s> they are in the business of selling computers and i cannot get her to understand that </s>
<s> she s been completely scared by her brother who worked there after i went on leave of absence and she s scared of me </s>
<s> sheesh </s>
<s> what good would it do for me to mess up computers that she s already been told are useless </s>
<s> i can t get that little bit through her head bless her heart </s>
<s> pretty much the best hd recovery system </s>
<s> yes started getting windows system warning messages my harddrive was failing and to backup critical files immediately or something to that effect i ignored it for about a week then started to worry i consulted my brother in law a retired hp guru well long short i followed the advise he d been giving me for years and installed a second harddrive in the pc created a ghost norton ghost 2003 image on the new harddrive and boot to that drive now scrapped the old drive </s>
<s> now doing ghost image back ups on all pc s in the house kids wife s no worries </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> mine was a result of my own carelessness </s>
<s> i did two quot updates quot for two differant programs windows xp and a spyware program </s>
<s> both required a reboot to finish installing the program </s>
<s> when i rebooted i got to the quot loading windows quot screen and never progressed past that </s>
<s> it would not boot in safe mode either </s>
<s> nothing i tried worked </s>
<s> i finally took it to my tech and he had to reinstall windows over the old one twice </s>
<s> most of my programs and data were unharmed however there were some programs i had to reinstall and there is at least one program which i used a lot which i can not access even after reinstalling it twice </s>
<s> the lesson learned update only one program at a time especially if there is a possibility of a reboot to complete the installation </s>
<s> i have been messing with pcs since the beginning think i still have a 10 mb drive around here somewhere and i have never </s>
<s> had a wd drive fail out of the 15 or so drives used </s>
<s> now that its been said watch disaster strike soon </s>
<s> i own 3 macs and a pc and in the last five years i ve had to replace 2 hard drives on my pc and one in one of my mac laptops </s>
<s> the first pc failure was out of the blue i booted up one morning and it just wouldn t recognize the hard drive </s>
<s> it was replaced under warranty and even though the techies swore that the drive was toasted i made sure to get the original drive back so i could crack it open and destroy the media inside no need to risk my personal data being taken off of it </s>
<s> on a lark i decided to purchase a hard drive enclosure and see if i could read the old drive good thing </s>
<s> i ve been using the original drive as a secondary hard drive for the last five years without trouble </s>
<s> i was even able to get all of my data off of it </s>
<s> so for the cost of a 20 enclosure i learned that techies don t know everything </s>
<s> the other times i was lucky enough to recognize the first signs of trouble and back up my hard drive in time to prevent the loss of any data </s>
<s> i now have two external hard drives both from the crash of my pc drives that techies swore were no good </s>
<s> when my mac drive crashed it made a really bad screeching noise so i m didn t bother trying to salvage that one </s>
<s> i have had two hdd failures </s>
<s> the first one manifested itself with some warnings flashed up on screen of read errors </s>
<s> i ignored the first warnings but soon had to take notice as the frequency increased </s>
<s> a friend suggested that i buy acronis true image software and back the drive up pronto </s>
<s> i did this and then made the new drive the master </s>
<s> i was able to patch up the read errors with various re loads of software and copies of missing data </s>
<s> this was a slow and tedious process </s>
<s> i then installed a slave hdd and aportioned the two drives primary for software and secondary for data </s>
<s> i also bought an external usb hdd </s>
<s> i now back up each internal drive to the other and both to the external drive </s>
<s> i do this about once per week </s>
<s> my second failure was more dramatic </s>
<s> the drive just stopped working </s>
<s> the only problem for me was the relatively minor cost of buying a replacement drive and installing it with the backed up data restored to it </s>
<s> getdataback gt excellent but have to pay seperate for fat32 and nstf </s>
<s> i had a hard drive failure on my 2 year old vaio desktop </s>
<s> i was very distraught as i was in the middle of an important photo archival procedure </s>
<s> i took it in to geek squad who told me none of my data could be recovered but i could pay up over a thousand dollars to send it off and try and get it recovered and there was no guarantee </s>
<s> i ended up looking in the phone book and found a local guy who went to geek squad picked up my hard drive recovered all my data replaced the hd and loaded up all my programs for less than 200 </s>
<s> i ve had five drive failures so far one being maxtor internal three la cie drives and one oem unknown manufacture internal </s>
<s> the la cie drives were fine after puting the internal ide drive into new enclosures avastor and throwing out the la cie enclosures never will buy that brand again the maxtor drive was ok after freezing it overnight letting it warm up slightly and then puting that into an enternal avastor enlosure </s>
<s> the unknown oem drive became food for worms </s>
<s> nothing i could do for it </s>
<s> luckily i always back up my entire internal on an external once a week </s>
<s> there are places that can gather data off of ruined drives even fire victims but it s extremely expensive </s>
<s> these drives of mine were all backed up </s>
<s> this is a lesson actually back it up just in case </s>
<s> almost everyone will eventually have a total or partial failure </s>
<s> the first time was a hardware malfunction </s>
<s> i noticed the drive making extra noises but was able to make a full backup of all my data which i was not doing regularly </s>
<s> whew </s>
<s> the second was when i got up from the dining room table caught my foot on my notebook s power cord and sent it crashing to the hardwood floor </s>
<s> the computer would not power up but upon replacing it and plugging in the damaged drive as an external one it turned out that only some sectors were bad and i was able to recover most of my data which again was not recently backed up </s>
<s> whew </s>
<s> now with external drives as cheap as they are and the cost of data recovery so high i have a couple of external backups and also archive everything that will no longer be modified such as original photos and ripped music i back up all my cds onto discs two copies in the case of photos </s>
<s> yes it has happened to me 6 months back </s>
<s> bought a recovery cd from spotmau </s>
<s> intially the downloaded version did not work for soe reason </s>
<s> i asked for money to be returned back and in the meantime recieved the original copy of the cd which i tried and to my surprise it worked </s>
<s> i mailed them back and told them that i would be keeping the cd </s>
<s> i am not sure how much it costs probably around 30 </s>
<s> i found myself staring at a black not blue screen that announced quot irreversible disk failure quot or words to that effect then the screen disappeared and i couldn t restart the computer </s>
<s> i have a dell computer with xp on disk c which was utterly entirely and completely gone with the wind </s>
<s> fortunately with some sort of prescience when i had the computer put together by dell i ordered two physical hard drives </s>
<s> thus all my data is on drive d so although dell had to replace one drive all my photos manuscripts i m a writer and other irreplaceable data were untouched </s>
<s> but now i don t trust any hard drive and have multiple backups an external hard drive and carbonite online </s>
<s> now whatever problems i have i will only have to contend with inconvenience not real loss </s>
<s> i strongly advise everyone to back up everything every time </s>
<s> mka </s>
<s> i ve been buying a new computer about every two years and so far have had only one major problem on a hp pavilion </s>
<s> however that was not a hard drive but a total motherboard failure </s>
<s> as it was still under original warranty it was fixed free of charge </s>
<s> about 15 years now with no hard drive problems </s>
<s> hope this doesn t jinx me </s>
<s> i have one box that is all scsi and has been bullet proof for almost seven years </s>
<s> it had all ibm drives because ibm was previously the only vendor offering a five year replacement warranty on their drives </s>
<s> i m a firm believer in quot you get what you pay for quot </s>
<s> four of the six 36gb drives died within 3 4 months but i can t really complain </s>
<s> 7 8 years of very hard usage and almost daily reboots with no errors </s>
<s> anyway they started taking random data errors and finally two of them refused to spin up so i ordered 5 oem fujitsu 36 gb drives and a wd raptor sata 2 0 36 gb for the primary boot drive </s>
<s> data recovery is trivial </s>
<s> i am a fanatic about taking backups at least once a week to one of the two drives which are dedicated backup devices </s>
<s> once a month i burn the entire c drive to dvd s and take that off site to the bank lock box </s>
<s> the house could burn down and at worst i would be out 30 days of work </s>
<s> i also take backups of the linux partitions when i am doing serious mucking with the os </s>
<s> one of the machines is a triple boot opensuse fedora and vista all 64 bit the other main box with the scsi drives is a dual boot opensuse and vista x86 </s>
<s> but i am going to nuke it with opensolaris x86 and use the entire box for a solaris machine rsn </s>
<s> i like toys </s>
<s> oh yeah i only use acronis products for backup recovery disk partitioning </s>
<s> the only problem i have had with their latest versions is the inability to handle the linux 2 6 kernel default inode size 256 vs 128 </s>
<s> they have sent me custom iso images for both disk director and true image echo but these still have the issue with the reformatted partitions </s>
<s> however if you preallocate the linux partitions with disk director 10 0 current ga and then do not reformat with the linux utilities during the install there is no problem taking the linux partition backups </s>
<s> i have an open ticket and i m their test guinea pig because i beat the h out their software </s>
<s> waiting for the dd 11 0 beta and the next tie beta or rc </s>
<s> tell them rex basham sent you with excellent reviews on all of their products </s>
<s> their tech support is fantastic typically one day or two turn around with a fix </s>
<s> the inode problem has them though it s been open at least two months </s>
<s> while using the laptop one day the whole system crashes that is it went hanging therfore it was forced to stop inorder to reset </s>
<s> but unfortunately the windows 2000 wouldn t boot up i e </s>
<s> wouldn t open up at all permanently </s>
<s> send to a repair shop and was told hard disk suffers mechanical failure sommething like the motor drive inside is sort of jammed and could no longer function </s>
<s> you can hear the mechanical quot clacking quot sound it produced </s>
<s> in the end replaced with a new drive to put back the laptop to operational service </s>
<s> the faufty drive was thus set aside considered unrepairable </s>
<s> all my datas inside are lost could not be recovered regards ray quah </s>
<s> in april 2007 i encountered a virus that managed to attach itself to the core programs that run windows xp </s>
<s> i was able to remove it but only through some dos commands as every time i booted up normally the virus started running </s>
<s> as a result i had to do a partial restoration </s>
<s> thankfully i had the appropriate cds for restoration purposes which came with my puter a dell </s>
<s> i was able to salvage most of the files on my hard drive but did lose some </s>
<s> the only problem the virus left is that i now have to activate my quick launch toolbar every time i boot up </s>
<s> it is annoying but at least it s better than having a virus </s>
<s> i should also mention that i did have virus software avg at the time i got the virus but it was one of those types that didn t have a fix available for it when it happened </s>
