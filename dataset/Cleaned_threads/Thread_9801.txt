<s> my work pc died quietly in the night </s>
<s> ps mobo cpu but the harddrive functions </s>
<s> i have reports on this drive that are due yesterday </s>
<s> since i m the it department i thought i would swap the drive into a working computer that i have at home </s>
<s> both computers are xp pro </s>
<s> the computer boots quot the windows did not start normally quot screen comes up and no matter what option i choose it freezes and will not boot into safe mode </s>
<s> i m thinking it s a driver issue due to the old computer being intel based and the new one is amd based </s>
<s> otherwise i m dead in the water until we replace my work computer </s>
<s> here s my question should i do a re install of windows xp </s>
<s> what is my danger of losing data </s>
<s> are there any better ideas than what i am doing </s>
<s> any input is appreciated </s>
<s> new machine is a soyo mobo with a 1 8ghz amd athalon </s>
<s> chip 680 mb ram </s>
<s> it worked fine with the previous harddrive a seagate 40gb </s>
<s> the new drive is a wd 80 gb already loaded with xp pro </s>
<s> to being put into a new diffetrent system </s>
<s> xp has stored data on all of the original and that was made the only acceptable to it when you activated it </s>
<s> if the switch were to be permanent ms might allow uopu to make the exchange and give you the info on how to re validate it in the new system </s>
<s> doubt if your reason will suffice </s>
<s> taking from a commercial company s computer to a home computer will go over like a lead baloon </s>
<s> i m just offering up one of my old computers as a loaner to shorten the time i m without a work pc </s>
<s> i work for a non profit and it could be over a month before i see parts to repair the old computer at work </s>
<s> we have several unused legal windows xp pro liscences microsoft is very generous to non profits </s>
<s> this is not the issue </s>
<s> although it is my understanding the xp pro is supposed to allow you to make 4 major hardware changes before it asks you to re activate </s>
<s> i ve done this before i m just concerned about data loss </s>
<s> i m starting to think it may be better to piggy back this drive on the drive that was orginally in the amd computer </s>
<s> which i really don t want to do and i agree taking a company harddrive for home use would go over like a lead ballon but that s not what i m doing here </s>
<s> thanks for the input </s>
<s> i ended up piggy baking the company drive onto one of my drives </s>
<s> not my first choice but data integrity was vital in this case </s>
<s> that company drive has been backed up to a fare thee well now </s>
<s> lol however if anyone else should have this problem you can reinstall xp as a repair install and it will update the proper drivers to the new pc the harddrive is in </s>
<s> you will need your cd key </s>
<s> activation is another story but microsoft is pretty decent about most diasters </s>
