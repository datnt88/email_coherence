<s> i want to look for usb port expansion cards </s>
<s> and the addition of usb 2 0 and a few extra firewire ports on the same card is always a good idea </s>

<s> bear in mind that this machine will not be able to run the latest version of os x and if it is running os x at all probably has 10 3 9 or 10 4 x on it </s>
<s> good luck p </s>
<s> it has 9 2 and i might upgrade to a more recent version someday or perhaps i will get an additional machine probably a notebook because too many desktops take up more space and install os x on something whenever needed because like i said i haven t used a mac for years and even on an older os i am still having lots of fun on it </s>
<s> just wondering how does the heatsink stay on anyways </s>
<s> is it electromagnetic </s>
<s> because if there is supposed to be that slimey cooling gel or whatever that stuff is between a processor and heatsink that stuff is not present </s>
<s> the heat sink is or is supposed to be attached to the processor with a clip </s>
<s> the clip is shaped so that it exerts downward pressure on the heatsink </s>
<s> it has a slot in both ends which attach to a plastic hook on the processor seat </s>
<s> this is the same as many pc heat sinks are attached </s>
<s> there should be some thermal paste between the heat sink and the processor </s>
<s> you should not operate your computer until the heat sink is correctly attached </s>
<s> you will fry the processor if the heat sink is not attached correctly </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> that i am not planning to use it immediately anyways since it only has ethernet connection on it and since i have more than one computer now i will just get high speed interent before i finish setting it up right now i am searching for websites for heatsink repair that has clips and thermal paste do you know of any to recommend </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> you already have the heat sink you just need the clip and some thermal paste </s>
<s> the paste you can get from radio shack and you may be able to get a clip from your local computer repair shop </s>
<s> they are pretty generic </s>
<s> after you get the high speed internet don t forget the router p </s>
