<s> i have a 64 bit 2800 processor with 768 of ram a geforce fx5700 le good hard drives and all that </s>
<s> im wondering why the heck when i play demos like far cry and the new medal of honor it runs so crappy </s>
<s> the new medal of honor demo i ran at 1024 by 768 and it was all sluggish </s>
<s> im wondering if i would need 1 gig of ram or maybe its my power supply which is only 350 watts </s>
<s> any help </s>
<s> do i just need to turn my settings down </s>
<s> the quot le quot seems to run slower than my fx5600 </s>
<s> that could be an issue </s>
<s> but i find most don t update motherboard and video drivers from the makers web sites </s>
<s> you didn t write how you deal with drivers </s>
<s> microsoft surely doesn t do this for us </s>
<s> best of luck and try keeping the pests out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> first update your driver files from the nvidia website </s>
<s> if the game still runs slow then i would recommend changing your settings not all just change the screen resolution to 800x600 </s>
<s> what a lot of people dont realise is these games are made for the next generation of video cards in other words they wont run as fast as there supposed to until the next gen video cards are out </s>
<s> basically its a sales pitch so that users go out and actually buy new video cards for there games </s>
<s> i hope you didnt just buy this gfx card as it runs slow </s>
<s> i suggest lowering your settings or saving up for a new gfx card good luck </s>
