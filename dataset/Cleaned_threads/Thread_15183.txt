<s> my hp psc 2410 is on it s last legs </s>
<s> it makes grinding noises at startup </s>
<s> i ve been to the hp website chatted with the tech on line and i refuse to send it in for servicing </s>
<s> not worth the money </s>
<s> the bottom line is i m looking for a reliable printer </s>
<s> i don t want an hp </s>
<s> i no longer need the scan or fax capability </s>
<s> color or just b w would be fine </s>
<s> suggestions welcomed </s>
<s> if you only need b w output then seriously consider a laser printer and yeah hp does good in this area </s>
<s> there are other makes out there and just about all basic laser printers do fine </s>
<s> if you still need color and an inkjet then look at canon models </s>
<s> i would not recommend epson or lexmark as they re expensive to operate and when an epson pukes it does so expensively </s>
<s> hp still makes a good printer look at other simpler models maybe one that accepts similar ink carts </s>
<s> as for a true reliable printer then also look into okidata more expensive but real workhorses </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> with printers often being cheaper than replacement ink cartridges it really makes you wonder ive used lexmark brother hp and canon </s>
<s> i think the canon is the most reliable </s>
