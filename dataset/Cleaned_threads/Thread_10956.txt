<s> how come i can t connect to my router automatically through vista home basic </s>
<s> i ve included the mac address into the router so by right everytime i turn on my laptop it should be able to connect to the router straight away right </s>
<s> i need to manually connect to the router by typing the ssid and the passphrase everytime i want to connect to the router can anybody help me with this </s>
<s> by the way i m using wpa psk security and my ssid is set to be hidden so that is why i have to include my mac address thanx </s>
<s> since there is no added security by doing that and it breaks some drivers why do that </s>
<s> here s the real deal podcast and they give the ssid a failing grade as a security measure </s>
<s> if you insist on that setting you ll have to contact the makers to see if they ll fix it so that works </s>
