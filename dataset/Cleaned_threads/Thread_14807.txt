<s> had my custom machine since summer 2003 i m thinking about keeping some parts while upgrading other core parts </s>
<s> here s a breakdown </s>
<s> keeping maxtor 120 gb hdd samsung 1 tb hdd wd 500 gb external hd 4x 512 mb ram sticks might upgrade to 4x 1 gb ram sticks nvidia 6800 gt 256 mb soundblaster audigy 2 gamer case its light aluminum with swinging side doors for easy access need new motherboard new processor thinking pentium quadcore gonna buy a blu ray drive and dvd rw drive i never attempted anything like this what are the potential problems i will run into </s>
<s> software installation etc </s>
<s> also i m not that familiar with mobos whats a good high end product </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> upgrade the power supply and count on the old os install to go down in flames </s>
<s> your disaster plan will come in handy </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if ddr ebay it </s>
<s> ditto with the 6800gt since a new 80 video card will be faster and you probably won t be able to play retail blu ray discs with the 6800 gt since it has no hd acceleration nor hdcp </s>
<s> if you have a retail version of xp you ll be able to re use it </s>
<s> otherwise bank on getting a new os vista </s>
<s> look into intel p45 based mobos </s>
<s> here s a bunch don t be fooled into thinking that higher cost higher performance </s>
<s> mobos using the same chipset all perform with 2 3 of each other </s>
<s> if you don t plan on overclocking just go by best price with the features you want </s>
<s> no need to pay extra for things you won t use like dual gigabit lan ports </s>
