<s> so it has finally come time to replace our 6 year old pc and after some looking i ve decided to get a custom pc </s>
<s> lacking the knowledge desire to build it myself i ve decided to use georgia computer workshop i am trying to keep the computer under 650 not including the monitor and i have a couple of questions first has anyone ever used or heard of georgia computer workshop </s>
<s> i can only find precious little information about it </s>
<s> what i have found has been good but lacking in quantity </s>
<s> second the computer itself </s>
<s> i am planning on using an athlon 64 x2 4200 processor 2 gigabytes of ram about 200 gigabytes of hard drive space and a geforce 7600gs </s>
<s> i am fairly stumped when it comes to the motherboard </s>
<s> what exactly would constitute as a good motherboard </s>
<s> most every other component i can research and understand what they are talking about but i am clueless when it comes to the main component of the computer </s>
<s> also what type of power supply would i need </s>
<s> the case i am using comes with a 450w power supply </s>
<s> i assume this would be fine but it is always nice to know </s>
<s> any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated thanks </s>
<s> antec nine hundred is a good choice for case </s>
<s> motherboards are becoming like hard drives </s>
<s> there s little difference in performance of the latest generation and almost all are good </s>
<s> for the amd platform there are two primary chipsets nvidia 500 series and amd s 580 690 since you didn t mention using dual graphics cards either chipset will be fine </s>
<s> then you just need to decide what features you want on the mobo </s>
<s> here are two good inexpensive mobos </s>
<s> biostar nforce 520 50 msi amd 690v 55 </s>
