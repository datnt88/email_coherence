<s> hi everyone i need help choosing an antenna im looking a directional antenna for a project </s>
<s> so far i found an antenna but im not sure about the quality of the antenna so im asking you guys </s>
<s> also i would like to know how much range i can look at with a 20dbm transmitter and a 36dbm 4w amplifier </s>
<s> transmitter gt amplifier gt antenna </s>
<s> also if someone knows a better alternative it would be great </s>
<s> thank you in advance </s>
<s> enkm </s>
<s> you can tell by the slick design that much of the effort went into the plastic artwork </s>
<s> great looking is your tipoff that they may have shortchanged the antenna work </s>
<s> this area is when ugly beats pretty every time </s>
<s> look up the cantenna as a fine example </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the cantenna is thick and big i need something thin that i can put on my project enclosure it has to be lighter than lets say 200 500 grams and as small as possible with at least 6 dbi </s>
<s> im pretty sure you are right and this antenna is cheap and a piece of garbage but i couldn t find a better alternative you might </s>
<s> thank you for your reply and i hope that someone will have a solution to my problem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> why not try it </s>
<s> well there is no problem with trying but im a paranoid type and i always have to have a plan b so if the antenna is not 10dbi or close i need to know that i have an alternative at any given situation </s>
<s> that antenna look like exactly something i need im also looking into the option of just modifying that antenna </s>
<s> also im wondering about the radiation pattern of that antenna since there are no actual radiation pattern image i am wondering if i can contact the manufacturer </s>
<s> yet i cant find that antenna at their website so im starting to wonder if it is actually their product </s>
<s> shady stuff </s>
<s> edit sorry there is a mixup of the websites </s>
<s> the product is there not much information is there anyway so we are waiting for someone who has that antenna to comment on its performance </s>
<s> why must it be exactly 9 or 10 db </s>
<s> something is not being told here </s>
<s> if that performance is that important wouldn t we get out our rf network analyzer see and test this setup </s>
<s> tipping my hand here </s>
<s> i wrote software for antenna testing years ago and used this and other gear to test these things </s>
<s> but at 10 bucks this is something you should just get and try </s>
<s> it s cheaper than time in the lab </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you sir are absolutely right thank you for your help amd have a great week </s>
<s> and for your question one db is not much but two three db is almost and twice as weak signal </s>
<s> im trying to establish a long range tunnel to connect to a device wireless which is why i need the best focusing antenna i can get my hands on one that is portable </s>
