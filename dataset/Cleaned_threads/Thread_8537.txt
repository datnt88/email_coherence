<s> ok guys um i have a hp pavilion 6645c series comp </s>
<s> its 5 years old now and i think my hd is failing now </s>
<s> my comp is now freezeing with regulatory time </s>
<s> problem is i have to buy windos xp if i buy a new hd </s>
<s> but what im wondering most about is what hd is perfect for this comp </s>
<s> if you know post it </s>
<s> the motherboard is a cognac don t ask me i can t find anything about this motherboard well from the company that made it </s>
<s> i have a intel celeron 566mhz processor 15gb hd with win98 </s>
<s> i have 384mb ram and a 64mb nvidia graphics card </s>
<s> are you getting error messages related to corrupt data or bad sectors </s>
<s> lots of things can cause freeze ups besides hd issues </s>
<s> and why must you get xp if you replace the drive </s>
<s> that system is a bit thin on hardware resoures to run xp well </s>
<s> you can still buy drives of 40 gigs readily and 20s are available </s>
<s> your pc at 5 years will probably handle a 40 gig drive but might not use the full burst speed of it </s>
<s> wd seagate maxtor and such are plentiful and any should work ok with your system </s>
<s> as for freezing it s fairly simple to do some basic cleaning and maintenance </s>
<s> get the dust out of the fans reseat boards and ram modules and do the usual disk maintenance and spyware removal </s>
<s> if that doesn t help your power supply might be getting weaker </s>
<s> make sure its fan and insides get a good blast of compressed air as well </s>
<s> also give the system a good scan for viruses and spyware </s>
<s> recover your windows 98 product key if you need it for a windows xp upgrade version </s>
<s> it is good to have the product key just in case </s>
