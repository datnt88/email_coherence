<s> hello i decided it would be a great idea to re install my win xp pro os because it seemed to be having too many problems </s>
<s> when i backed up the drivers i must have missed a very important one </s>
<s> now i ve searched the net for this but to no avail </s>
<s> i m running xp my dvd is a matshita sr 8176 cd dvd rom working fine until i did this my error keeps saying that cannot find ittimg3 dll i don t have the disk for my dvd rom please help </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> install an os can easily outstrip one s capabilities and too many will plunge into such and find themselves at a shop and out one hundred bucks that said and you ve already begun there is likely a typographic error in that dll name </s>
<s> either that or it s just a worm virus or other malware and you don t want it </s>
<s> as to the missing dvd rom this is not a matter of xp not supporting said device but more likely some other glitch like we read at in no uncertain words i would delete the noted registry keys and retest </s>
<s> in no uncertain words a new install of xp note no sp1 will likely find the user instantly having to deal with the ms blaster and sasser worms the moment they connect to the internet even if they installed their antivirus </s>
<s> this is why it s better to seek help on the issues rather than reinstall </s>

<s> thank you bob </s>
<s> are you saying i will need to buy a new cd dvd rom </s>
<s> set the bios to boot from the xp cd </s>
<s> if it boots they it s unlikely that it has a read issue </s>
