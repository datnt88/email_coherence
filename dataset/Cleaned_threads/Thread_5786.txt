<s> i have a windowsme pc that has a box in the middle of the screen that says quot video cable connected quot it appeared out of nowhere </s>
<s> the screen is black red with this box in the center </s>
<s> the screen looks like a tv when the cable goes out or no signal </s>
<s> you can hear the programs loading up ibut nothing appears </s>
<s> this was my pc and i gave it to my son </s>
<s> he has alot of programs morphous downloads music hotmail all that stuff </s>
<s> i did take the pc back to original state after i gave it to him but it still isn t working correctly </s>
<s> i don t know if this is fixable or should i just get another pc </s>
<s> all he wants is something to make cds and play games </s>
<s> any suggewstions would be appreciated </s>
<s> thank you for your time </s>
<s> and have a monitor with a miss worded message for not receiving a signal i had one that would say on signal should have been no lol </s>
<s> some of these messages are in pidgen english </s>
<s> the all he wants is quot something to play games quot is a little humorous because gaming demands the better range of computers not the castoffs </s>
<s> graphics also create high demands for a better computer </s>
<s> first try reseating the video card make sure all connections are good </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> the chernobyl virus actually was a fine example where the flash bios could be erased </s>
<s> this virus didn t survive long but did teach a lesson </s>
<s> the use of morpheous is a great way to learn the brutal lesson that such software is like crack cocaine for your pc </s>
<s> if you run such you may get burned </s>
<s> nuff written about that </s>
<s> your post is far too lightwieght </s>
<s> no mention if the unit powers ups and beeps </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the unit does power up and i can hear programs loading </s>
<s> it does make some noise wouldn t say it s a beep </s>
<s> i am not a computer whiz so unless the fix is rather easy not sure i can do it </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> the unit gets power and you think it s loading the os but the display never shows any bios or other indication other than the connect cable or similar </s>
<s> that means you test the display on another machine and another display on this machine </s>
<s> tell what happens </s>
