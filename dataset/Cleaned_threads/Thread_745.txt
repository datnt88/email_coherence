<s> i have always had cable with something like a linksys router with built in firewall </s>
<s> i just bought a verizon hotspot samsung sch lc11 to use at a house that i will retire to in the future because it has no cable </s>
<s> the hotspot has no firewall of course i have windows firewall on my computers </s>
<s> what i want to know is how good is this to have without a hardware firewall and is there something i should do </s>
<s> also i bought a wifiranger from 3gstore dot com to use with the hotspot so i can run ethernet cable to my computers </s>
<s> the wifiranger is a router but has no built in hardware firewall but does a router not help by the way it works to make like a firewall in a sense </s>
<s> looking for advice and just to learn more about the setup i will be using </s>
<s> thanks sly </s>
<s> in a home environment nat does almost as much to protect you as a firewall </s>
<s> the primary job of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized traffic from getting to your machine </s>
<s> when you have only a single real ip address the router has to be told where to send the traffic </s>
<s> it is smart enough that if you talk to a site on the internet it will allow the traffic to come back in </s>
<s> for traffic that comes in without you asking first the router is stupid and throws it away since it dose not know where to send it </s>
<s> not a lot different than if you put a rule in the firewall </s>
<s> if you run dmz type configuration that tells the router to send everything by default to a machine then you need a firewall more since unknown traffic will come into a machine </s>
<s> there are ways to place a hardware firewall in your setup but it gets messy since the wan link is wireless and you still want to use wireless on your lan </s>
<s> you could always buy one of the usb things for the verizon and buy a aftermarket router that has a firewall if you really wanted </s>
<s> i suspect you will be fine with just the pc firewall just do not setup the dmz or port forwarding unless you absolutely need it </s>
<s> make sure you test this before you commit to a 2 year contract </s>
<s> if you cannot get lte 4g coverage in the house it will be very slow compared to anything else you have used </s>
<s> 3g coverage is fine for phone surfing but is painful when used with a computer </s>
<s> ok let me see if i understand </s>
<s> you are saying that if i use the wifiranger since it is a router it will act as a firewall even though it does not have nat </s>
<s> if i am right nat is what is usually what a router has when they say it has a built in firewall i can not remember what it stands for but it seems i remember it checks incoming packets or something like that </s>
<s> so if i use the wifiranger i should not worry right </s>
<s> what about only using the hotspot are you saying it is also like a router and gives protection </s>
<s> sorry just learning about all this if it seems i am not picking this up quick </s>
<s> thanks for your reply sly </s>
<s> i googled nat and do not fully understand but can see your point </s>
<s> so how would i know if the wifiranger has nat if it does not say in its information or are you saying that all routers have nat </s>
<s> all routers pretty much have to run nat </s>
<s> you only have a single real ip address </s>
<s> you may or may not have multiple machines that need to share this address </s>
<s> nat is the method used to share the address between machines </s>
<s> this sharing is the key to why being stupid protects you much like a firewall </s>
<s> think of nat as what happens if you order something and ups ship it to a large company but don t put the name of the person </s>
<s> all the people share the same address </s>
<s> if the mailroom had a list of packages each person was expecting they could deliver it </s>
<s> if the package was not on the list they don t know who to deliver it to </s>
<s> so if some bad person sends you a ups package it gets stuck in the mail room </s>
<s> nat work like that it build a list dynamically of packets to accept </s>
<s> the devices that do not run nat are called bridges in most cases very technically even a router does not always nat but this happens in commercial setting where you have multiple ip assigned to you </s>
<s> thank you for the reply and taking time to explain </s>
<s> it makes since what you are saying that using the wifiranger router is all i need to do </s>
<s> what about when you are just using the hotspot and connect to your computer with wi fi does the hotspot also act as a router as you have explained and would have nat </s>
<s> even if you have only a single computer the hotspot assume you might have more so it will run nat </s>
<s> i think this device can only run as a router </s>
<s> really the only time you don t have nat involved is for people who plug directly into a cable or dsl modem </s>
<s> still lately even these devices tend to be routers running nat even if they are called modems </s>
<s> you have been great thanks for all the information </s>
<s> sly </s>
