<s> in other words </s>
<s> if my cable modem only has 50 mbps is that all i will get out of my wireless router even if the router has a higher mbps rating </s>
<s> so let s add one more thing </s>
<s> the speed from the web site or server to your router is set by the slowest link anywhere in between </s>
<s> it s not fun to read folk post about slow download speeds and they act surprised when this is brought up </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m not sure i understand your answer </s>
<s> i have a 50 mbps router and i want to upgrade it </s>
<s> my cable modem is only rated at 48 mbps down stream </s>
<s> if i bought a router with say 150 mbps would i see and benefits or would my modem limit any benefits because it s only rated at 48mbps </s>
<s> there s a server over somewhere and from there to your pc are a bunch of links </s>
<s> the possible speed from that server to your machine is going to be limited by the slowest segment or link </s>
<s> this is why most of the time increasing the cable modem or wifi router speeds rarely improves the speed from most servers on the internet </s>
<s> since your router is already faster than the cable modem the benefits are indeed muted to near zero </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> o k </s>
<s> i get that </s>
<s> so in your opinion would it be helpful to upgrade both the modem and router or is the server the weakest link </s>
<s> what i really want is more range from my router </s>
<s> range is limited by a few simple things that we can t see </s>
<s> the power of the router and the environment or walls and location of the router and buildings </s>
<s> sometimes it s interference from things like old cordless phones </s>
<s> no maker has a stronger router signal because all have a limit imposed by the fcc or your government </s>
<s> to improve range i move the wifi router to a better location </s>
<s> some folk ignore the basement warning and that s easy to fix the range by moving it out of the basement </s>
<s> i ve seen folk pay hundreds for such moves </s>
<s> here i continue to move mine for free </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> maybe a simpler example </s>
<s> you take your pc which has a gig interface and plug it directly into the cable modem and how fast would you expect it to run </s>
<s> the reason you would want a faster router is if you wanted to say stream video between devices inside your house </s>
<s> since this does not pass though the modem it could run at the speed the router allows </s>
<s> now bobs comments are the reason it all doesn t matter </s>
<s> lets say you wanted to copy file from your friends pc and he only has a dsl connection that can run 384k </s>
<s> no matter how fast your modem is you are restricted by his device </s>
<s> this is true for all types of connection you just can t find out how slow or fast they run </s>
<s> i might have noted a cheap free booster like the following </s>
<s> gt </s>
<s> your download speed is dictated by your isp and the bottlenecks that bob mentioned </s>
<s> period </s>
<s> my cisco cable modem is docsis 3 and is rated at gigabit output speed as is my d link router </s>
<s> my cable speed is 15 megabits second </s>
<s> what do you think my download speed is </s>
<s> my wireless n is rated at 54 mb s </s>
<s> what speed do you think i get </s>
<s> both questions i get 15 mb s on a good day usually slower because of those accursed bottlenecks </s>
<s> in other words you get what your isp provides </s>
<s> now on my home network between devices i get blistering speeds </s>
