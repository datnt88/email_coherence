<s> i have been trying to find the binary file for an old soyo bios 5eh 1bc1 bin no luck even from the obsolete section on the soyo website </s>
<s> my old pc is working fine but won t recognise hard drives over 40gb </s>
<s> so i ve a choice between using a smaller second user drive or buying a new motherboard </s>
<s> any other suggestions </s>
<s> hope the question s clear enough i m new round here cheers sj </s>
<s> you are in the timeframe that you shouldn t touch such a machine in case it just falls apart underneath you </s>
<s> my advice is to get the 40g and get by </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> are you saying it won t recongize a 40gb partition or a physical hd 40gb size </s>
<s> its important as then you could partition a large hd into smaller partitions under 40gb probably 32gb as the limit for each partition </s>
<s> did you visit the hd makers website for hd install s w to help install beyond whatever the bios limits are </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> if the bios only sees 40gb partitioning won t make any difference </s>
<s> most hds come with overlay software which would enable your system to see all the space </s>
<s> or you might try something like this </s>
