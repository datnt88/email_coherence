<s> hello i am going to give the configuration please give your opinions on it and how i can improve it </s>
<s> intel core2quad 2 4 processor 10200 dg33 fb motherboard 4850 2 2gb ram 3900 250 gb hard disk 2750 samsung syncmaster 732nw monitor 8400 logitech mouse and keyboard 725 sony dvd r w combo 1500 graphic card 8800gt 512 mb 11000 cabinet coolermaster 460 w smps 5000 do i need a 600w or is 460w coolermaster smps enough </s>
<s> which is better xfx or msi </s>
<s> as i am opting for 4 gb ram which operating system should i use </s>
<s> is dg33 fb good enough or do i need a abit ip 35 e </s>
<s> or should i take a biostar </s>
<s> should i take 8800gt or ati radeon 4850 </s>
<s> please help me on these queries and one more thing my config should not cross 50k </s>
<s> what changes should i make if at all my config crosses 50k </s>
<s> i will be very thankful if you answer my queries thanking you sagar note all the prices are in indian rupees </s>
<s> go with the abit p35 based mobo if you can afford it </s>
<s> it allows for overclocking and better memory optimization </s>
<s> hd 4850 is faster than 8800gt </s>
<s> the coolermaster 460w is a no frills basic power supply but is sufficient </s>
<s> xfx has a life time warrenty and great customer support so there are folks which would only use xfx why ati </s>
<s> if you are into mmorpgs many of them like the nvidia better </s>
<s> if into mmorpgs i had less issues with the 8600 512 then the better more expenxive cards i also suggest using a local shop that would post your cpu and mother board and power it up </s>
<s> that way you have back up if something goes bump post means they attach the cpu to mother board with fan and power it up </s>
<s> also include decent fans both side back and on top of cpu </s>
<s> if into specific games have you gone to their web site tech help sections to see what video cards are experaincing problems </s>
<s> what set ups seem to work best </s>
<s> best price isn t always safest way to go </s>
<s> sometimes having support after the sale is worth the extra then over the net purchase something to keep in mind </s>
<s> well just some ideas </s>
<s> food for thought </s>
<s> sli </s>
<s> you could double up graphic cards if you really want to push your max granting your mobo supports it </s>
<s> msi vs xfx </s>
<s> neither </s>
<s> i have read too many problems with both </s>
<s> i used to be a fan of bfg but i gave up on that too as they were a little overbloated in my opinion </s>
<s> i like evga </s>
<s> good csr support </s>
<s> lifetime warranties </s>
<s> additionally one of the few companies who offer tradeups </s>
<s> return an older graphic card mobo for the more recent component and they will give you credit towards the new one </s>
<s> not many companies offer such a perk </s>
<s> 8800 gt </s>
<s> good bang for buck </s>
<s> better card than the 9800 s actually </s>
<s> if you want more power 8800gtx </s>
<s> 8800gts s are mid range and would be pretty sufficient </s>
<s> 8800gt gts support 2 way sli </s>
<s> 8800gtx supports 3way sli </s>
<s> each card has a some different specs overclocking capabilities </s>
<s> i happen to like the 8800gts 512mb cards myself </s>
<s> they are a good cost performance ratio </s>
<s> they look wicked too </s>
<s> i don t care for biostar boards </s>
<s> again asus boards or evga would be my preferance </s>
<s> evga perhaps more for me as they lean to spec boards particularly for nvidia platform </s>
<s> i ve never steered away from nvidia even with ati having had some great cards </s>
<s> they re good for each other cause the competition drives the technology so i don t hate on either or </s>
<s> do your research it is a preference thing </s>
<s> my viewpoint has been amd processor ati card or intel processor nvidia card </s>
<s> doesn t have to be that way but i think they just pair better and that is purely a personal opinion </s>
<s> i think you are fine with processor choice </s>
<s> not worth paying much more right now </s>
<s> there will always be something bigger faster better and more expensive </s>
<s> vista will accept and register more ram for the system than xp </s>
<s> that does not mean it will lead to a performance boost </s>
<s> xp will read somewhere around 3 gig s of the ram </s>
<s> circumstances and tweaks bending to get more benefit from xp with ram beyond 2gigs </s>
<s> research </s>
<s> forget where vista taps out right now for ram but i think it is in the range of 6 8 gig area and that depends on the version </s>
<s> honest opinion vista is the red headed stepchild of xp which can never seem to walk straight </s>
<s> xp is a better os by far </s>
<s> more efficient </s>
<s> do 4 gigs ram on xp pro and even if it doesn t read all 4gigs the mobo will utilize pretty close to all of it </s>
<s> bios tweaks can assist as well </s>
<s> if you are a gamer and your graphic card is a huge necessity i would say you need to push past the 600watt psu area </s>
<s> 460 doesn t cut the mustard for most cards and you don t want to inefficiently power your pc </s>
<s> 600 800watt psu with good rating should be sufficient consider 700 800 if thinking of doing 2 gpu s in sli mode </s>
<s> hard drive </s>
<s> this often is argued </s>
<s> me i d shoot for sata 3gb s 7200rpm w 32mb cache </s>
<s> people will say you wont notice a difference true gamers pcfanatics will argue every ms counts when your clocking performance </s>
<s> i feel the newer 7200rpm s outperform the 10000rpm drives as long as they are sata 3gb s </s>
<s> research </s>
<s> case cd dvd drive etc etc </s>
<s> is nothing but preference </s>
<s> price under 1500 usd </s>
<s> do the conversion for rupees </s>
<s> my 2 cents </s>
