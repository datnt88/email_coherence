<s> i have read here that putting a non working hard drive in a freezer will make it work again </s>
<s> i am asking for the specifics on the max temperature the hard drive can sustain in a freezer and how to bag it properly </s>
<s> i have 2 failed hard drives a 250gb and a 10 gb so i am desperate to try a way to start these drives since a professinal data recovery and a new computer is out of the question due to the prices </s>
<s> dcomander1 </s>
<s> in something absorbent first then put it in a freezer bag and place in the freezer for 12 hours </s>
<s> if it spins up copy the files quickly before it fails </s>
<s> this doesn t make it work again </s>
<s> just might get it going long enough to copy the files out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the quot freezer cure quot is a carryover when hds were in the mb range </s>
<s> plus it may allow the electronics quot contract quot if an open or burnt component but this is only a temporary fix not a real fix </s>
<s> thus you need to get any data if that s the sole purpose and do it quickly </s>
<s> understand if it fails further it maybe corrupt the data even more so beware </s>
<s> even then it may not work at all just be sure to double wrap the hd in plastic and allow at least a few minutes before use to climatize and then power up </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> will the drive spin up and the read write heads track </s>
<s> as if i remember correctly the freezer trick was for bad sectors </s>
<s> on drives that do not spin up i use an external enclosure </s>
<s> this allows me hold the hdd in various position shocking the drive with the power switch </s>
<s> when and if the drive spins up i hold that position cross my fingers and start copying files </s>
<s> luck bill </s>
<s> i tried the freezer trick doesn t work i have tried it over and over again and it still doesn t work </s>
<s> i got a 10gb hard drive from ebay and it worked for a few minutes before it started clicking and it failed </s>
<s> i am mad that ebay would allow such people to rip you off of 10 dollars </s>
<s> hmph and i am buying yet another hard drive from ebay this time a 500gb for 11 dollars </s>
<s> i hope this drive is not a waste of money anyway what shall i do to get my moneys worth out of that 10gb hard drive </s>
<s> i would hate to see my money going to some one who rips people off regularlly of their hard earned cash </s>
<s> sorry to be the bearer of bad news </s>
<s> come on a 500gb hd for 10 </s>
<s> it reeks of a possible failure if only worth is 10 for parts </s>
<s> to believe it ll work for any length of time is less likely on its own </s>
<s> remember if it sounds to good to be true then its not </s>
<s> however you an play with parts all you want as you can be capable of some repairs provide you treat this as a learning experience </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> ive heard it all now freeze your hard drive to make it work </s>
<s> any proof this works or is this just more fairytales from the noob section </s>
<s> well after doing some research on the topic i did find out that it can work for short periods of time </s>
<s> as in a few min or an hour ect </s>
<s> wich can be long enough to get the files you need off the hard drive </s>
<s> but also begs the question why ask that question here </s>
<s> for me to find the info took all of 30seconds </s>
<s> click on new tab google type in freezing your hard drive and wala i found a million sites that have tons of info about that topic </s>
<s> a failing laptop drive </s>
<s> they thought that spinrite could bring it back but the drive wouldn t stay good long enough to try it </s>
<s> so the put the entire laptop in the garage that was just above freezing 40f or so </s>
<s> that did the trick </s>
<s> remember we are dealing with abnormal hardware with issues </s>
<s> all bets are off </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> its not a permenant fix </s>
<s> the files were saved and we got them onto a new hard disk </s>
<s> well unless you count that the new hard disk will fail in a few years </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> not sure why but occasionally it works </s>
<s> another trick that sometimes works for drives that don t quot spin up quot is the quot snap spin quot trick to start the platters turning </s>
<s> understand these are last resorts that usually don t work and that may damage the drive but which are being used in situations in which you are ready to trash the drive anyway </s>
<s> i wouldn t worry too much about wrapping the drive you are only going to put it into the freezer for 1 2 hours </s>
<s> good luck it sometimes does work but don t be surprised if it doesn t </s>
<s> if your hard drive has a physical error bearing that s bad rubber seal that s preventing it from spinning up etc it might work </s>
<s> in any case it won t hurt it as long as you make sure you do not get excessive condensation on the unit </s>
<s> in my case ibm travelstar 18 gb that failed a few years ago it did not work </s>
<s> but it did allow the drive to spin up which it did not do before freezing it </s>
<s> hard drive recovery is still pricey and any quot no destructive quot method that you can try at home really does not do any damage </s>
<s> it might start up the drive and as other already have posted be ready to copy the files </s>
<s> this is an article i have ad for a while on the subject 200 ways to revive a hard drive we based one of our most popular pop quiz challenges on a situation every tech support person has faced or will face at least once a failed hard drive </s>
<s> in that particular case a compaq prolinea 4 66 user was getting errors like quot disk 0 error quot and quot invalid drive specification quot here were the other facts in the case </s>
<s> i have successfully revived 5 hard drives using the following technique </s>
<s> i found that the problem was not the drive assembly but the controller board attached on the drive </s>
<s> my process 1 buy an identical hard drive </s>
<s> my experience tells me it must be exactly the same right down to the manufacturer part number size speed etc </s>
<s> 2 remove the controller board from the good drive and swap with the controller from the bad drive </s>
<s> the screw head type varies torx allen phillips etc </s>
<s> 3 install and boot or read from the old hard drive with the new controller on the drive installed </s>
<s> transfer the data to a known good drive </s>
<s> 4 you can continue to use the old drive with the new board or swap back and use the new drive with the new board </s>
<s> this beats the many dollars data recovery companies charge to recover data for the price of a new drive </s>
<s> hey if it doesn t work at least you have a new hard drive you can use </s>
<s> wrap well let it come up to temp and i still think your chances are about 10 </s>
<s> condensation will usually kill it and if you warm it up slowly itwill lock again but hey if you can t afford restoration you have nothing to lose </s>
<s> let us know what happened </s>
<s> place the failed drive in an usb external enclosure wrapped tightly in a ziploc bag or plastic wrap </s>
<s> then keep it in the freezer with the usb cable trailing out to the computer </s>
<s> computer too far away </s>
<s> place the frozen drive in a cooler with sealed gel ice packs </s>
<s> i have not tried this but it would keep the drive cold far longer and would minimize condensation issues </s>
<s> this is a last ditch effort to try to get the drive spinning to copy the data </s>
<s> the reason behind this is the principle of heat contracts and cold expands </s>
<s> if the mechanism inside the dirve is jammed this could unjam it </s>
<s> it won t work if you have a fry circuit or crash heads on the platter or the mechanism is to far gone for this to work </s>
<s> i read all the stuff before it and couldn t figure out how a hard drive can be kept cold enough during reinstallation to be worth the time in the freezer </s>
<s> i can just imagine some poor sod freezing it rushing to install it try it but it s warm and fails remove it freeze it forever </s>
<s> but somehow putting a drive anywhere moisture is bound to be while keeping it attached to an electrical source is bound to make you very very unhappy sooner or later </s>
<s> i had a gateway drive that was bad and failed in 2 months </s>
<s> it also made the click of death before it was removed </s>
<s> i would have tried the freezer trick with that 16 mb beauty but gateway replaced it with an upgrade a whopping 21mb </s>
<s> and would have voided that replacement if i d removed the drive myself </s>
<s> by the way that quot garbage quot gateway lasted 3 years after that and then only the sound card failed </s>
<s> go figure </s>
<s> regarding an ebay hard drive at any price tho remember that a hard drive is delicate and may have been working before the shipper dropped it post office punted it onto a convayer belt that dropped it and the mail carrier dropped it trying to put it in your mailbox before handing it to a neighbour who shook it out of curiousity to give you </s>
<s> but you re annoyed that you spend gasp </s>
<s> 10 </s>
<s> i suggest you skip the mail order altogether and go to a used computer parts store test the drive there and bring it home yourself </s>
<s> no space in the freezer needed d </s>
<s> i have tried this several times as a last resort </s>
<s> once it allowed me to read the drive long enough to retrieve data </s>
<s> another time the drive actually kept working reliably after the freezer treatment i have no idea why </s>
<s> most times it doesn t work at all </s>
<s> but if the next step is to toss the drive why not try it </s>
<s> take a look at this webpage </s>
<s> very interesting </s>
<s> ereal2000 i think you got it a bit backwards heat expands and cold contracts but you were on the right track </s>
<s> this idea sounds bizarre but desperate times call for desperate measures </s>
<s> next time i think we ll find a way to double maybe even triple ghost the files to keep a crisis from happening again </s>
