<s> i just bought a maxtor quot diamond max quot 200gb internal hard drive and became frustrated with the installation </s>
<s> the instructions state that you must create a bootable floppy disk with the ata drivers for windows xp </s>
<s> that would be fine except that my computer has no floppy drive </s>
<s> the directions suggest that you use a temporary plug in external floppy drive for this purpose great </s>
<s> i had to drive 20 miles to buy the drive now i have to go back and buy a floppy drive so that i can install it </s>
<s> my question is this </s>
<s> are all internal hard drives like that </s>
<s> do they all require a floppy disk boot </s>
<s> i d rather buy and install a different hard drive at this point </s>
<s> the thing is maxtor didn t include quot floppy drive quot in the specs listed on the box so i thought i d be fine </s>
<s> now i m scared to purchase any of them </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> the hard drive is what model number </s>
<s> what is the make and model of the computer </s>
<s> with a proper installation of windows xp there is no extra driver installation required </s>
<s> the exception is sometimes when you need to install a serial ata sata driver to use an sata hard drive but that driver would come from your pc or motherboard maker </s>
<s> there are some maxtor hard drive tools maxblast powermax et al </s>
<s> that may be helpful but they are not drivers and are not required </s>
<s> once the hard drive is installed you can partition and format it in disk management </s>
<s> also there are some maxtor hard drive models that require a firmware upgrade to work properly in some computers </s>
<s> it s simply an issue with microsoft s os that didn t include drivers and we are paying the price </s>
<s> for pata you didn t tell drives we don t have this issue since sata arrived after windows xp </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i installed a wd 10 000 rpm sata drive and i had to make a floppy boot drive with the sata drivers on it </s>
<s> that was installed on xp </s>
<s> the other three hard drives or maxtor ide 7200 rpm and they did not require boot up floppy to run them but i had to set up bios so i could run raid and sata </s>
<s> and i had to get the drivers from the mb disc that came with the mb raid drivers </s>
<s> the raid driver were installed when i got to my desktop </s>
<s> good luck wendell h </s>
