<s> i own a emachine w3107 amd sempron processor 3100 ie 7 windows xp 32b 1 80 ghz 1600 mhz 256 kb l2 cache 512 ddr sdram with a dsl modem i ve been looking at an add on dual core processor upgrade the cost is 75 00 are these add on processors good bad or otherwise </s>
<s> the machine i found does not support dual core cpus </s>
<s> you ll have to supply a link to the product for me to change my mind </s>
<s> support emachine link it doesn t show info on a dual core upgrade </s>
<s> follow the upgrade link and see if it does but i thought it </s>
<s> as an amd cpu and socket provided </s>
<s> good luck willy quot 0 </s>
<s> i found it the other day on amazon com the ad said turn your single core computer into a dual core computer handle twice the workload it s half the size of a normal processor </s>
<s> i can only assume you re talking about a quot overdrive kit quot type of thing </s>
<s> i don t recall such an item it s probably cheaper maybe to get a new mtrbd </s>
<s> that truly supports dual core cpu and go from there </s>
<s> that way you ll have a greater range of upgrades as its needed </s>
<s> if you can provide that amazon link review it again and match it against your current system specs </s>
<s> otherwise its a dead end for dual path only a single core will do </s>
<s> using the link i provided in the last find the upgrade link and post a question to emachine support and see what they may suggest </s>
<s> heck it doesn t hurt to ask </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> just go to amazon and write in processors they should come right up </s>
<s> you can t put in another processor and hope it will work </s>
<s> please be very specific as to what kit you are looking at </s>
<s> that is a link </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> send me an adress and i ll send you the paga </s>
