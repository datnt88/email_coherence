<s> i have a compaq pc 733 mhz p3 128mb ram currently running an nvidia tnt2 graphics card </s>
<s> i d like to upgrade the graphics now that there are plenty of used g force cards on the market </s>
<s> i play a lot of older games unreal tournament riven madden 2002 ghost recon but there are some newer games that i d like to get which require a better graphics card </s>
<s> is there a noticeable difference between a g force 2 and g force 4 card </s>
<s> any other suggestions </s>
<s> to be honest your gfx card upgrade wouldn t do an awful lot without the memory been upgrading too </s>
<s> i would check out the games you want to play and see what the system requirments are </s>
<s> the geforce 4 is quite a step up from the geforce 2 the tnt card were very good in their day like the gf2 mx 400 s </s>
<s> do as matt page suggest add at least another 128mb of ram before you do anything </s>
<s> it is not hard to do </s>
<s> check for what type you will need for your particular pc </s>
<s> here are some old test of video cards that show performance rating under different games </s>
<s> april 2002 december 2002 i would suggest the geforce 3 ti 500 or the geforce 4 ti 4200 </s>
<s> my nephew has a similar system </s>
<s> but it s a 1ghz and 256mb </s>
<s> i fitted a dvdrom drive so he has his own dvd player too </s>
<s> at 733mhz that s more than enough for dvd playback but 128mb will be far too tight </s>
<s> i d forget today s games on such a machine </s>
<s> but 512mb is not a bad idea </s>
<s> if you find a cheap </s>
<s> geforce 2gts or there abouts it will deliver about 2x or better the graphic speed but with that cpu and ram it will never be a gaming machine except for old titles try the year 2000 </s>

<s> a very good card </s>
<s> cheap </s>
<s> need an agp slot i m not sure if they come connectable to standard pci slots </s>
<s> geforce ti4200 with 64mb and after 2 years of heavy use it still competes with newer cards </s>
<s> i benchmarked 3dmarkse against a new ati 9600 256mb and beat it handily </s>
<s> furthermore this card can be overclocked however it can get unstable by doing so so i leave it at the default settings </s>
<s> just make sure you have the agp slot like the previous poster said </s>
<s> it has a fan so it will drain a bit more power than your old card i am guessing </s>
