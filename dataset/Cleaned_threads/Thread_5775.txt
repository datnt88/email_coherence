<s> i have just installed my first hard drive and the hardware installation was smooth </s>
<s> now i have a problem with the partition of the hard drive </s>
<s> i don t understand what it means to partition the hd and most importantly how much to partition it </s>
<s> i have a western digital 160gb eide </s>
<s> i understand that i won t get all that 160gb but i want to get the most out of it using ntfs because i read that it is more secure than fat </s>
<s> my computer specs are 900 mhz 512ram western digital 160gb eide please explain what partitioning the hard drive is in lamest terms and please explain how many sections should i partition it into as well as any recommendations </s>
<s> thank you so much </s>
<s> partitioning is simply carving out a space for data storage </s>
<s> you have to partition and then format a drive before you can use it </s>
<s> if you re installing a version of xp with service pack 2 you can create one partition for the entire drive </s>
<s> use the xp installation disc to do this and format with ntfs file system </s>
<s> yes i m installing xp with sp2 so i should just go ahead and create one partition for the hard drive and that s it huh </s>
<s> yes i will install windows xp with sp2 so all i need to do is partition the hard drive in one size and i won t run into any problems down the road in the future </s>
<s> be sure to backup any files you can t live without on a regular basis </s>
<s> for example if you have numerous pictures and music files you ll want to copy them to some kind of removable media such as cd r dvd r or thumb drive and store them in a safe place </s>
