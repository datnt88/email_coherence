<s> i have been working with layouts in word and doing some simple graphic design with ms publisher and adobe photoshop elements on a dell laptop </s>
<s> i now want to move on to adobe indesign cs and photoshop full version and plan to buy a desktop with 2 monitors </s>
<s> everything i read about graphic cards has to do with video that i have no interest in </s>
<s> can anyone recommend specs for a good graphic card ram size 1gb enough </s>
<s> and monitor size and specs for this type of application </s>
<s> money is no object but i don t want to do an overkill either as everything will inevitably be obsolete faster than i can amortize it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> monitor is also important i dont really know how to pick </s>
<s> i guess i m somewhat old school </s>
<s> i use and am very happy with a viewsonic graphic series g220fb </s>
<s> it s a flat screen crt </s>
<s> quite frankly i haven t seen a lcd that can match it </s>
<s> and it costs far less that a lcd the same size and resolution </s>
<s> ati and nvidia probably are the best out there </s>
<s> go for their high end cards </s>
<s> you didn t say what video cards your mobo supports </s>
<s> something with 256mb should work fine </s>
<s> i ve heard great things about the new pci express standard </s>
<s> i m a freelance photographer and i use the ati 800xpro and believe the pair make a good match </s>
<s> about the second monitor i just saw a reasonable 19 quot lcd for under 200 </s>
<s> go figure </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
<s> i don t know too much about what your software needs so i apologize if i m wrong </s>
<s> you re going to need 1 gb of memory 2gb would help </s>
<s> you probably could use a quadro ro firegl card with at least 128mb memory </s>
<s> however those cards are somewhat pricy so stick to what you can afford </s>
<s> i would also get a dual core cpu like the athlon 64 x2 </s>
<s> monitor size depends on what you view more is better so whatever you can get is good </s>
<s> unlike a computer system you can keep using a monitor for years so i d put more money into the monitor size at least 19 quot </s>
<s> good points </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i ll look these up </s>
<s> may i ask if anyone has specific recommendations about monitors in terms of color rendition and definition </s>
<s> i can walk into a store and visually compare say flat screen tvs of various technologies sizes and specs but i cannot do the same with monitors since most are sold only by mail order such as dell </s>
<s> that s why i am asking if anyone has experience based recommendations thanks </s>
<s> you may want to look at lcd monitors with 10 bit gamma instead of 8 bit </s>
<s> a company called lacie make both crt and lcd monitors for graphics use though they aren t promoting the crt any more </s>
<s> their 300 series lcd monitors are of the highest quality and have 10 bit gamma correction </s>
<s> i believe they are based on top quality nec units you can also get calibrators for their monitors </s>
<s> they are no longer promoting the crt monitors on their site but they may be still around </s>
<s> you should definitely get a monitor with a digital dvi input and a quality video card with dvi out </s>
<s> using a digital signal will produce the sharpest image on an lcd monitor </s>
<s> the best type of video card for graphics would be a high end graphics workstation card like one of the quadro 4 nvidia cards </s>
<s> they are not made for gaming but for accurate colour </s>
<s> hope i ve been of some help </s>
<s> larry </s>
