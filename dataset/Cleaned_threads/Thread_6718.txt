<s> greetings i am interested to build a home theater pc and would like to know if there is a graphic cards that fit the following requirement 1 pci e interface </s>
<s> 2 hdmi output port </s>
<s> 3 component video ycbcr output port </s>
<s> 4 can support both blu ray and hd dvd players </s>
<s> i did the research and narrow down to the visiontek x1650pro hdmi </s>
<s> however i do not know if card is reliable support of blu ray and hd dvd players </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> quot in order for a commercial blu ray disc to play you need to be able to decrypt the high bandwidth content protection hdcp copy protection it uses </s>
<s> this can only be done via a dvi or an hdmi connection to a graphics card that supports hdcp decryption </s>
<s> currently sony says there are no cards that support this quot later we finally started to see a few cards but you discover you can t use most displays since they must have hdcp as well </s>
<s> it s a minefield of issues so be sure you have return privileges if you find your selection doesn t work </s>
<s> covers this as well as tells more about the vista angle of copy protection </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> there will be no commercial content from the component video ycbcr output port at hd resolution since that connection is not encrypted </s>

<s> dear bob thank you for your answer the graphic card that i had mentioned the visiontek x1650pro hdmi has the following description in its spec quot 256mb ddr2 memory hdcp eprom onboard quot that is why i interested to do more study about this graphic card </s>
<s> however you had mentioned another ineresting point that i did not know before about hdcp on the monitor tv as well </s>
<s> did you mean that my widescreen 1080p lcd hdtv need to also support hdcp </s>
<s> again many thanks for your information </s>
<s> regards hiep nguyen </s>
<s> but many have tried this only to discover it doesn t always work </s>
<s> the industry is not making this quot easy quot bob </s>
