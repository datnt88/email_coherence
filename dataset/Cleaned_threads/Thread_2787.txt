<s> i have a dell e521 that runs vista </s>
<s> when i go to restart the computer the dell loading bar at startup crashes about half way up </s>
<s> why does this happen and what can i do to fix it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> be sure to ask dell com be ready to hear people ask for more clues such as what you installed from stock if a reload of the os fixes it the contents of the event viewer system restore effects etc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have had exactly the same problem since i acquired my e521 in february </s>
<s> dell even replaced the entire system but the same has happened </s>
<s> i m sure it s the combination of software that they bundled in with the pc but i don t yet know what i should be removing </s>
<s> my view however is that dell must surely be responsible for the s w they package with the pc </s>
<s> it hasn t worked since out of the box and it s extremely frustrating </s>
<s> with connected usb devices booting at start up </s>
<s> only have your mouse and keyboard connected in the back not the front or in the monitor </s>
<s> printer is ok i don t have it on unless i m using it anyway </s>
<s> i use a usb flash drive for readyboost but don t connect it until my system gets past the bios screen then is ok to put in </s>
<s> lastest bios update still causing problems and was pulled </s>
<s> here are some things you can try to find the root cause based on my past experience with dell pcs and what i see here in the forums 1 unplug or turn off all usb devices except the keyboard kb and mouse </s>
<s> restart and see if it happens again </s>
<s> if so continue on </s>
<s> 2 try swapping the usb ports the kb and mouse are plugged into </s>
<s> 3 did you or they install software you don t need </s>
<s> if so turn off the power turn it back on and try to remove software you don t use </s>
<s> 4 does the computer start feeling warm to the touch when you reboot it </s>
<s> if so there may be an issue with the cooling fans power supply processor or the bios </s>
<s> try flashing the bios and if that doesn t solve the problem contact dell to have the desktop looked at by a technician </s>
<s> also check the ventilation around the computer make sure it has a couple inches of quot breathing room quot so the desktop can be cooled properly and that the area has little or no dust </s>
<s> it seems there may be a glitch in the bios or that it s having a problem recognizing something you have plugged in </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> i have had the same problem w my e521 ever since i got it </s>
<s> however when i got mine i immediately did a clean install of xp pro sp2 </s>
<s> so it has none of dell s preinstalled software or vista </s>
<s> there is a link on dell s support site that makes reference to a bios issue w the e521 </s>
<s> that may be helpful </s>
<s> heres my experience with my dell dimension e521 </s>
<s> i bought it about a year and a half ago athlon 64 2 4ghz 3800 2gb ddr2 667 mhz ram windows vista home basic dvd rw cd rw drive 160gb sata hdd </s>
<s> the computer it was intended to replace was a compaq presario with an athlon 64 2 0ghz 2gb pc 3200 ddr1 400mhz ram win xppro </s>
<s> i replaced the motherboard on this beast twice before giving up all hope of repairing it </s>
<s> it had been configured with a wireless adapter netgear ma101 and using comcast high speed internet </s>
<s> i also use comcasts free download of mcafee security suite and webroot spy sweeper anti spyware </s>
<s> im also using a logitech wireless trackball and keyboard </s>
<s> when i first set it up i had never used vista before but im usually undaunted by new software </s>
<s> very soon i found out that vista didnt recognize the wireless adapter so i couldnt connect to the internet </s>
<s> strike one </s>
<s> since i couldnt connect i couldnt download mcafee </s>
<s> strike two </s>
<s> so i decided to load spy sweeper from a flash drive </s>
<s> the version i had wasnt vista compatible and i needed to download a new version </s>
<s> see strike two strike three </s>
<s> at this point i was so frustrated that i took out my license of win xppro and loaded that after formatting the hard drive </s>
<s> this made vista completely unable to be restored </s>
<s> that done i upgraded the ram to 4gb with two more 667mhz modules </s>
<s> everything went swimmingly until i started having to learn vista for work and decided to reinstall it at home once i got all the new drivers and a new wireless adapter netgear wg311t vista compatible </s>
<s> at first i realized i didnt have all the original distro disks for the dimension </s>
<s> i contacted dell and they agreed to send me a new set of four disks vista home basic this time with sp1 </s>
<s> the dell applications disk windvd and roxio creator 10 disks </s>
<s> points for dell customer support </s>
<s> upon trying to install vista from these new disks the installation kept freezing the system </s>
<s> the display would break up into little vertical bars about high by a few pixels wide in rainbow colors </s>
<s> the only way out was to hard reset by holding the power button in until it shut off </s>
<s> i spent a ton of hours trying to troubleshoot the software i was using to figure out what was interfering with the system and causing the system freeze with no luck </s>
<s> i first removed all non original hardware keyboard trackball previously added ram to bring it back to original hardware configuration as closely as i could all with no luck </s>
<s> it would still freeze at random intervals </s>
<s> if i booted it and just left it alone it would often run for hours </s>
<s> as soon as i started doing anything with it like web surfing or downloading software it would freeze </s>
<s> i tried removing spy sweeper and replacing it with adaware and used avg free for anti virus figuring they night have smaller signatures than the others </s>
<s> i couldnt even download mcafee without a freeze within the first few seconds of the download </s>
<s> i next accessed the dell website on a laptop and went through the troubleshooting tree performing every test and diagnostic they suggested and giving a reply at each test completion </s>
<s> all tests passed but the problem persisted </s>
<s> i googled for potential solutions but i saw that many others were having similar problems with the e521 and vista with no real solutions </s>
<s> sorry guys get linux </s>
<s> is not a solution </s>
<s> one poster did however mention memory timing as a possible solution </s>
<s> i looked into the bios setup but there was no provision for changing memory timing </s>
<s> this made sense to me though </s>
<s> when the system is idle there is no aggressive memory usage </s>
<s> web surfing or downloading is very memory intensive so i looked at the system specs and saw that the e521 motherboard accepts three memory types ddr2 at three speeds 533 667 and 800mhz </s>
<s> i tossed a coin and decided to try a slower memory module </s>
<s> i bought two 1gb sticks of 533mhz ddr2 at my favorite online surplus computer supplier and after wasting a full day with troubleshooting i replaced the 667 sticks with the 533 i restarted and have not seen the problem reoccur in about 48 hours of continuous operation </s>
<s> lt b gt lt i gt this was my experience and your mileage may vary lt b gt lt i gt but i would definitely suggest that you consider changing your memory timing either by a physical change as i did or if your system supports it to tweak the bios to effect the same change </s>
<s> needless to say i feel i have my computer back after a hugely frustrating time trying to debug software only to find out that it was a hardware incompatibility </s>
<s> i hope this helps anyone who may be experiencing the same or similar symptoms with their e521 with an athlon 64 2 4ghz </s>
<s> thanks m </s>
