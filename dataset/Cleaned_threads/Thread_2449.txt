<s> hi this started last night </s>
<s> i wanted to copy some files to a cd but the program told me i had none </s>
<s> after checking my computer i saw that my drive was not listed under quot my computer quot and it was not working </s>
<s> it is listed in the device manager with an exclamation beside it </s>
<s> in the properties for the drive it said the drivers were either missing or corrupt </s>
<s> i have tried installing them but it says the ones i have are the most recent </s>
<s> i tried uninstalling and reinstalling </s>
<s> no change </s>
<s> i checked my bios but saw nothing unusual there </s>
<s> the drive is listed </s>
<s> when i put a cd in the light starts flashing and it does sound like it is turning </s>
<s> but i cannot access anything on it </s>
<s> what could i try next </s>
<s> or is the drive damaged </s>
<s> take care </s>
