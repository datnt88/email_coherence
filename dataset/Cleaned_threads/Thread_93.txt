<s> i have comcast cable with a motorola surfboard modem model sb5120 installed 6 25 2005 so it s 5 years old now </s>
<s> it goes to an alphashield then to a neatgear wgt624v2 router </s>
<s> a couple times a day it will disconnect </s>
<s> the internet will slow down and then some of the lights will go out </s>
<s> only lasts a minute or two then it will be ok and the lights will be steady </s>
<s> does that sound like the modem going out or a comcast problem </s>
<s> is 5 years pretty old </s>
<s> or could it be my alphashield or router </s>
<s> maybe a little complain might help </s>
<s> if i were comcast i would definitely try to make you happy </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> doing this </s>
<s> the modem is 5 years old not the problem </s>
<s> i bought the modem so i m not renting it from comcast </s>
<s> so before i called comcast i wanted to ask if it could be the modem going out which i would have to replace myself </s>
<s> of course there s possibility that it could be bad </s>
<s> the nice thing about a router modem can be had for about 50 </s>
