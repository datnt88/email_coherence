<s> i recently put together a computer that has a blank harddrive </s>
<s> i bought windows xp bootable to use as an operating system </s>
<s> when i turn the pc on it says that there is no harddrive </s>
<s> when i put in my old 2gb harddrive it uses it right away but not the new harddrive </s>
<s> ive tried everything </s>
<s> it works i know that much </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> and it cannot detect the harddrive </s>
<s> is this a sata hdd </s>
<s> by chance </s>
<s> 1 bios not set to autodetect drives 2 sata drive on raid configured port move to another port 3 pata drive not jumpered correctly 4 defective drive or cable the first place to look is in the bios setup menu </s>
<s> boot there see what drives show up </s>
<s> it sounds as if the cd dvd rom is detected </s>
<s> the hd listing should be in that general area </s>
<s> as well make sure the hd spins up </s>
<s> you should be able to hear the motor start and the clicking from the heads initializing </s>
<s> in the xp installation where you must hit f6 </s>
<s> to load any special drivers for sata hard disk drives </s>
<s> did you try that </s>
<s> sometimes you have to create a floppy disk to load the driver </s>
<s> it would really help if you provided more detail about the hard drive </s>
<s> make model number type sata pata </s>
<s> and the motherboard mfg and model number </s>
<s> keep us posted </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> the harddrive is a quantum fireball pata part qml20000ld a it came in a gateway tower </s>
<s> it had windows 98 on it </s>
<s> the light for the hd comes on for a second but then shuts off </s>
<s> the hd spins for a moment and then quits </s>
<s> everything is hooked up right i took it apart and everything looks fine </s>
<s> i have a really old 2gb hd that i have rebuilt and it works just fine for being nearly 11 years old </s>
<s> i cant figure out the quantum </s>
<s> are you an archeologist </s>
<s> or tried it on another pc </s>
<s> sure the jumpering is ok </s>
<s> sure the cable is ok </s>
<s> if any question place the hdd on cable by itself </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> ok ok the parts are old but that half the fun getting them to work again </s>
<s> ive tried the hd on several pc s with the same result </s>
<s> i have tried 9 different cables the jumper is on the master setting and still no luck </s>
<s> i may end up buying a new hd i dont want to because this is just a little project i have to save an aunt from a windows 95 machine </s>
<s> that thing is old </s>
