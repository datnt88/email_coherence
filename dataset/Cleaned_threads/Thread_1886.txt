<s> replaced my mobo with the exact same one that was on my system intel desktop board d815epea2 </s>
<s> the only difference was the old mobo had onboard video and the new one needed an agp card </s>
<s> i installed a evga card e geforce mx4000 and added a trendnet wireless pci card </s>
<s> i left the hard drive with windows xp home that was being used on the old system and 2 cd drives </s>
<s> the problem is that when i turn on the system i get no video </s>
<s> nothing happens on the monitor </s>
<s> i looked at an old post in april where someone had the same problem but it was inconclusive </s>
<s> would appreciate some ideas as to why this is happening </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> when i have this type of problem with a clients pc the first thing i do is to remove all expansion cards except video from the motherboard </s>
<s> and then disconnect all drives from the motherboard so the only thing you have left is memory and video card </s>
<s> make sure the drive cables are disconnected from the motherboard not just the power cables </s>
<s> then try booting the system </s>
<s> if you get video then try reconnecting the drives and installing the expansion cards one at a time </s>
<s> if you don t get video then either the video card memory cpu or motherboard is bad </s>
<s> if you get down to the last four items remove the battery from the motherboard or reset the bios with the jumper and try again </s>
<s> try removing all the memory and see it you get a beep warning from the bios from the missing memory </s>
<s> if there is no beep without the memory then the motherboard is the problem if you do get the beep warning then it is probably a bad video card </s>
<s> you can also remove the cpu from the motherboard and power on the system for a few seconds to reset the motherboard sometimes the cpu and motherboard get out of synch and doing this resets them </s>
<s> hope this gives you some ideas about what to try </s>
<s> if you can t boot how did you install the video drivers for the card </s>
