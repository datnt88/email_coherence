<s> i ve got an lcd monitor that can take vga input </s>
<s> i would like to buy a cable so that i can use my wireless keyboard and mouse from my bed </s>
<s> the only thing is i am not sure which cable to get </s>
<s> i see that there are db15 and hd15 </s>
<s> what is the difference </s>
<s> there are limits to how long you can reliably get away with </s>
<s> pure guess would be that the hd is a better made and shielded cable to allow possibilities of running with a longer cable </s>
<s> price may show the difference </s>
<s> my card has a dvi connection so i would be getting a dvi to apg converter and then a 10 cable </s>
<s> so i should go with the hd15 </s>
<s> cable will probably work ok i assume that the adapter is simply the standard block about 2 inches long </s>
