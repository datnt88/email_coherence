<s> thats not a good sign </s>
<s> since you don t see the bios windows booting or even a beep not noted in your post the machine has likely failed </s>
<s> nothing in your post tells me that its not the machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what i don t understand is why the system works at the shop but not at home </s>
<s> i ve even tried plugging various parts of the system into the wall directly bypassing the surge protector to no avail </s>
<s> that s the rub </s>
<s> your ac cord could be bad the machine could be on its side at home upright at shop </s>
<s> etc </s>
