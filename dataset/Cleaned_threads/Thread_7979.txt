<s> i have a wireless b linksys router w two wireless cards </s>
<s> one on the notebbok and one on the 2nd desktop </s>
<s> i have a total of 3 computers </s>
<s> 2 of them are wireless </s>
<s> with the noteboock and the wireless desktop my connection is constan but will range speed </s>
<s> i can have both wireless computers sitting 6 feet from the router and will get real crappy speeds on the internet </s>
<s> is it possible that i have someone outside of my two computers accessing my wireless connection </s>
<s> and if so what can i do to identify and rectify the situation </s>
<s> thank you for any advice you can give on this topic </s>
<s> have you updated all firmware and drivers </s>
<s> remember that microsoft won t do this for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> use ie and go into the setup screen for your router </s>
<s> check the mac address for your cards in the mac setup screen </s>
<s> set the router so it will only allow these mac addresses to use the router </s>
<s> you can also set up a log file that will keep track of every use of the router and usually you can set it up so the log is e mailed to any address you want </s>
<s> it is easier to go in and look at the log rather than getting a bunch of e mails from the router </s>
