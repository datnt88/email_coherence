<s> so my printer just went out on me and i really became dependent on my all in one but if i m gonna put out the money on a new one i would love to get one that will print directly onto my cd s and dvd s </s>
<s> does anyone know of an all in one with disc printing </s>
<s> haven t seen one of those </s>
<s> printers print to paper </s>
<s> there are new burners that will print to the cd </s>
<s> epson has three models i know of ranging from 100 to about 400 the latter also being a quality photo printer but none of them are all in ones </s>
<s> i know of no other paper disk printers at this time </s>
<s> you must realize that these will not print to ordinary disks but only those with a special surface to receive and retain the ink </s>
<s> hope this helps frank </s>
