<s> i have a netgear wireless router model wgr614v4 </s>
<s> recently i signed up for sbc dsl service the modem that comes with the plan has 1 lan port quite ridiculous was my first thought </s>
<s> anyway i want to connect my wireless router which also has 4 lan ports to the dsl modem and make the wireless router a dhcp server as a desktop has to connect somewhere right </s>
<s> my current planned setup which has not worked is telephone cable from wall to dsl modem cat5 cable from dsl modem to netgear wan port cat5 cable from netgear port 4 main configuration port to desktop computer </s>
<s> any ideas on what settings i need to change would be much appreciated </s>

<s> and connection to fail this maybe your problem </s>
<s> netgear s bridge mode did not work for me </s>
<s> i tried all the fixes netgear posted and none of them work i sent the wgr614 back </s>
<s> i tried a different solution </s>
<s> first connected the computer directly to dsl modem i disabled the pppoe feature from the dsl modem enabled bridge mode </s>
<s> then i connected the dsl modem to negear router and from the router to the computer and enabled the pppoe sign in feature in the wgr614 into dsl </s>
<s> at the log in for pppoe in the wgr61 screen put in your sbc id and password sbc id is something like twocats sbcglobal net </s>
<s> the wgr614 was still set to be the dhcp server </s>
<s> i enabled the dhcp feature </s>
<s> keep in mind that after making each connection i waited for some time about 2 minutes </s>
<s> after restarting the pc it should take a few moments to start working </s>
<s> when you go to 192 168 0 1 address it should go directly to the netgear router s admin page if you need to make any changes </s>
<s> it worked for me </s>
<s> ljs </s>
<s> this kinda normal for sbc yahoo </s>
<s> you need to connect with a pc first to setup the account then logoff hookup the router and configure the router with your account info and then have the router logon to sbc </s>
<s> also about once every 3 months or so i can seem to get a conection </s>
<s> so i logon with a pc then logoff and hookup the router again and it s fine </s>
