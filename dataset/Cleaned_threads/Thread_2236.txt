<s> download this update and when watching tv it will no longer freeze and stutter </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i m looking for advice about this computer </s>
<s> i m looking for e new desktop for digital imaging </s>
<s> how has this machine preformed for everyone </s>
<s> the gateway gt5032 is a great computer for processor intensive operations if you aren t afraid to do a couple of upgrades </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> you need a real graphics card </s>
<s> the cpu ships with an onboard nvidia geforce 6100 video processor on the motherboard </s>
<s> good for everyday stuff but not so good for serious computing </s>
<s> i upgraded to a geforce 7800 gt oc pci express card </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> it ships with 1 gig of pc 3200 ddr memory do not believe the tech assistance info here </s>
<s> it falsely says the system uses pc 4200 ddr2 it does not </s>
<s> install at least one more gig there are 4 memory slots each supporting up to 1 gig of high quality ddr i used dual channel matched corsair memory </s>
<s> the unit ships with 1 gig cas 3 memory you can do much better </s>
<s> after these upgrades i can easily play 2 instances of dark age of camelot on the computer without missing a beat </s>
<s> photo editing is a breeze even if my antivirus is scanning in the background </s>
<s> one caveat here while the media center computer has 7 usb2 ports and 2 firewire ports it only has one pci express slot and 2 pci slots one of which is occupied with a useless 56k modem and the other with the tv tuner </s>
<s> consequently expandability is very limited </s>
<s> the gt5032 does not have a 3 5 quot floppy drive </s>
<s> on the plus side thanks to its btx motherboard layout this is one very quiet computer </s>
<s> it also has convenient memory card slots in the front </s>
<s> this is a good little computer that with some cash and a bit of tweaking can be a great one </s>
<s> bought this computer yesterday and tv locked up minutes after install saw lots of peoples reviews at retail stores after purchase who stated same problem </s>
<s> found it hard to believe the quot pros quot at consumer reports 1 retailer microcenter ks did not have a clue about this problem and recommended this as a great media center computer for tv use </s>
<s> went back to store next day and they offered to exchange hahaha </s>
<s> luckily searched google one last time for a solution tonight and here it is the update from microsoft provided by quot the wesker quot fixed the problem asap </s>
<s> have been running tv now for about 2 plus hours without skips stalls freezing etc </s>
<s> lpaultracy i noticed that the power supply on the gt5032 is only 300w max </s>
<s> the minimum for the geforce 7800 gt oc pci express card is 400w </s>
<s> did you also replace the power supply when you tweaked your gt5032 </s>
<s> i m getting very flaky results with the standard 300w power supply and the bfg help desk said that it was because of the lack of power </s>
<s> i would also like to know if he had to upgrade the power supply </s>
<s> i did end up upgrading my power supply </s>
<s> however i am still having problems running two monitors </s>
<s> if i leave the hardware acceleration at full then i get both monitors going black with the only recourse left is to reboot </s>
<s> i have monitored the video card and cpu temperature and they are all in the normal range </s>
<s> it varies from 15 minutes to several hours before it shuts off </s>
<s> i have hibernate and all power saving turned off </s>
<s> if i run just a single monitor it seems to stay up longer but even then i have had it lock up </s>
<s> i tried setting the hardware acceleration to none and it ran for over 24 hours with no problem </s>
<s> i m now notching it back up one tick at a time </s>
<s> i am now several hours into the second tick up from none </s>
<s> has anyone else had these kinds of problems </s>
<s> by the way i already replaced the bfg geforce 7800 gt oc card once </s>
<s> the second card exhibited the very same symptoms as the first </s>
<s> is this a problem with the gateway the video card or an incompatibility between the two </s>
<s> any ideas out there </s>
<s> system specs gateway gt5032 4gb corsair valueselect ram bfg geforce 7800 gt oc video card antec smartpower 2 0 500w power supply samsung syncmaster 914v gateway fpd2185w </s>
<s> i actually never replaced the original power supply in the gt5032 </s>
<s> have had no issues with it even under a load </s>
<s> i have had no problems at all with the bfg 7800 gt oc card out of the box </s>
<s> when i put in the card i didn t notice the manufacturer s requirements for a 400 watt power supply but have experienced no issues at all with the stock gateway 300w ps </s>
<s> i am using the integrated sound card and i do not use the tv tuner card at all </s>
<s> like i said i have had great luck with this system card set up </s>
<s> i have an outside the box question for you is it possible that one of your power dongles from the ps to your card are screwed up somehow </s>
<s> this could result in lower than expected current flow to your video card and all sorts of funky problems </s>
<s> i know the gateway didn t have sufficient power cables on the ps when i got mine so i had to pick up some splitters </s>
<s> it may be possible that one of yours has some hidden damage </s>
<s> if so this could be a three dollar fix </s>
<s> just a thought </s>
<s> paul </s>
<s> paul that is a good idea </s>
<s> although i have been having this problem even before i replaced the power supply </s>
<s> i have just now used a second pci e power cable that came with the antec power supply and plugged it into a different outlet on the power supply </s>
<s> another thing that i forgot to mention is that the hardware acceleration is set independantly for each monitor </s>
<s> the setting for the samsung has been set on full since the beginning </s>
<s> the setting for the gateway is the one that i have been varying </s>
<s> i found that either none or the very first notch seems to work at least up to 24 hours </s>
<s> when i tried the second notch yesterday it failed after several hours </s>
<s> today i have switched the power cables as described and set the hardware acceleration to full to see if it fails </s>
<s> thanks for your suggestion </s>
<s> i have a gt5032 i see you put a new video card in how do you install a new video card in it pci e i bought an ati x1600 pro card but am a little unsure about installing it do i disable anything first jumpers uninstall drivers can you tell me how to install the new video card into the gt5032 thanks </s>
<s> i ended up returning the my gateway and going for an hp </s>
<s> however in general you should follow the instructions that came with the video card </s>
<s> i believe they suggest that you install their drivers first then instal the card </s>
<s> the one thing you will have to do is upon startup go into the boot settings and change the video from the built in to pci e i don t remember the exact settings but you should be able to find it </s>
<s> hope this helped </s>
<s> i m going to try a 7600gt in the stock gt5032 </s>
<s> will let you guys know how it goes </s>
<s> im going to be buying one in the next few days i have a 400w psu now someone told me that they require 26 amps on the 12v rail know anything about that </s>
