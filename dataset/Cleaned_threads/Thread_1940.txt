<s> most reviews are for the older models so i thought i would get some feedback from actual owners of these machines </s>
<s> i went to bestbuy to see these machines side by side and the hp seemed to print a photo copy of a picture faster and of slightly better quality but the epson was low on magenta ink </s>
<s> the epson s photo was actually redder surprising since it was low on magenta </s>
<s> i wasn t able to test the regular black and white printing function or the scanning </s>
<s> two separate best buy reps said that the hp was overall the better machine and that the epson tends to waste a higher amount of ink when it comes to loading new ink cartridges </s>
<s> i had been concerned with some of the problems mentioned regarding the previous hp model and he assured me that hp worked out the kinks </s>
<s> i wanted to hear from actual users owners of these two machines to see if this was true </s>
<s> i am curious as to how the hp does in the scanning area and in long term use </s>
<s> neither of these machines is cheap so i don t want to be sorry </s>
<s> my last two printers lexmark were junk both fed paper crookedly and one eventually stopped working after 6 months of very little use </s>
<s> so i am definitely staying away from lexmark </s>
<s> my goal is to find a high quality multi purpose that will do the functions it offers well and will last a long time </s>
<s> and it has to operate on an mac os x software </s>
<s> i would love to hear your feedback </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i see a problem with many comparisons and that the color calibration is usually ignored </s>
<s> here s a device that really levels the playing field gt bob ps </s>
<s> i like both units so i don t see a clear winner </s>
<s> telamoon i would be really interested in any responses you have had from your question as i am currently weighing up these 2 printers as to which to buy </s>
<s> i also am looking at getting either the hp2610 or a canon mp73 </s>
<s> epson i will avoid due to the amount of ink it uses a close friend bought the epson and luckly it broke down after 2weeks and they could change it to the hp2410 </s>
<s> they had used over half the ink already in that short time just with normal printing at the cost of ink that is expensive </s>
<s> i have an rx600 which works great for me </s>
<s> i have not been disappointed with the ink life or cost </s>
<s> one thing i ve found with pictures is that kodak paper produces much much better images than the epson stuff that came with the printer </s>
<s> i am also looking at the rx630 model for asia </s>
<s> since i am an epson fan i had owned hp and canon printers which i swear never to use again before switching to epson and have no complaints i am trying to decide whether to get the all in one or the r800 which adds a second black cartridge as well as this new gloss enhancer total 8 cartridges </s>
<s> anyone know if the photo prints are that much better on the r800 or should i stick with the multipurpose rx630 </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i would head down to an apple store </s>
<s> the few times i ve been there both models were on the floor with sample prints </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> at best buy i spoke with an epson rep and saw a demo on the rx600 </s>
<s> the only demo he would offer was a glossy print from a digital camery media card </s>
<s> i must say that the print quality was excelent butttt it took over 2 minutes to print one 4x6 </s>
<s> this time was very excessive for me and did not include photo set up it was actual print time only </s>
<s> i print many photos and think i would get frustrated at the time involved </s>
<s> i wonder what it would to print an 8x10 </s>
<s> i did not get to scan or copy any items </s>
<s> i am also concerned about the many ink cartridges </s>
<s> although this does produce a beter quality photo print i again would get frustrated that i might be constsntly replacing or the other </s>
<s> many reviews i have read on the rx600 state time and ink usage is poor but quality is excellent due to higher max resolution of 5780 compared to 4800 i plan on a trip to staples or best buy to attempt comparisions on scanning time and quality and document printing </s>
<s> one very important feature is that the hp 2610 has stand alone fax capabilities the rx600 does not fax </s>
<s> if you are interested in wireless the hp model 2710 has a built wireless capabilities and a larer lcd screen </s>
<s> i hope to read more opinions on these two printers but for now i prefer the hp2610 </s>
<s> has anyone considered or reviewed the lexmark p6250 </s>
<s> a one hour photo shop </s>
<s> and even then you don t get it in one hour </s>
<s> also compare it to kiosk photo printing </s>
<s> you may be wanting 15 second printing which was possible at one time with that polaroid photo printer but the print price was much higher </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> let s also compare it to an hp photojet that prints a 4x6 in 40 seconds and a lexmark that will print a 4x6 in 55 seconds </s>
<s> technology as i konw it is designed to speed things up not slow them down </s>
<s> i was very dissappointed in that 2 minute print time </s>
<s> the print quality was a excellent in the epson and if anyone has the time and patience i would recommend that printer </s>
<s> but if your printing many photos and have little patience like myself look elsewhere </s>
<s> when i tested the rx600 at best buy i too found it took forever too </s>
<s> this was a big deterrant for me </s>
<s> i don t have a lot of patients when it comes for waiting for printing time </s>
<s> the printing quality was better on the rx 600 but that was because the photo quality print cartridge was not installed in the hp </s>
<s> and i have been told that that makes a huge difference </s>
<s> two different best buy s employees recommended the hp 2610 based on their experience with each machine in the store </s>
<s> it turned out that the rx600 was returned more often and ran out of ink quicker </s>
<s> i also liked the fact that the hp offers a fax </s>
<s> i haven t been able to set up my 2610 because they have been doing a lot of work in my home </s>
<s> when i get to use it i will post my feedback </s>
<s> ps </s>
<s> i do not ever see myself purchasing another lexmark i don t need to learn that lesson a third time </s>
<s> telamoon thanks for the additional data </s>
<s> sounds like you researched the product pretty good </s>
<s> good luck with the hp and let us know how it works </s>
<s> i am interested in scan speed and photo quality </s>
<s> the epson rx 600 in now eliminated from my possibly choices </s>
<s> i am also trying to compare different multifunctional models </s>
<s> the best review i have seen so for is at </s>
<s> it gives a pretty good break down of the different models and rates each of them on different assets </s>
<s> i have been using the rx600 for the last 4 months i have used and still using on a daily basis all of its functions and i am not dissapointed </s>
<s> printing high quality photos might force me to replenish ink cartridges at a faster rate but epson cartridges are usually cheaper than hp s </s>
<s> i also liked the vivid color reproduction of the rx600 i guess it is a personal choice </s>
<s> we mustn t forget that it is an mfd it has a lot of functions but the output of the functions will never equal the output of specific quot single purpose quot devices equipments </s>
<s> btw i don t work for epson but i work in it and come across both hp and epson products everyday </s>
<s> i don t really like hp s mainly because of their high ink prices and because they don t have individual ink cartridges on any of their models </s>
<s> my last hp printer constantly kept on running out of just one of the 3 colors and i had to replace the whole thing </s>
<s> i personally like the rx600 from what i ve seen at the store its good image quality makes up for its slow printing speed but it has many bad reviews and it seems to me that a lot of other people find many problems with it that has stopped me from buying it </s>
<s> i liked the many features of the rx600 and was in dire need of a replacement for my hp g55 psc bought in 98 and mostly still working except for paper jamming </s>
<s> bought it over the net </s>
<s> it does a great job scanning slides and negatives which is a plus for me </s>
<s> however gt it is very slow with plain old printing forget photographs </s>
<s> gt there is no separate envelope feeder you have to remove the regular paper to put in an envelope </s>
<s> gt it is determined to feed a blank sheet between each print job </s>
<s> i can t find a way to turn that off </s>
<s> ideas </s>
<s> gt the twain driver even the new one on the web site doesn t work which means i can t use either the epson supplied ocr reader or my textbridge </s>
<s> this apparently has to do with a conflict with xp sp2 </s>
<s> gt currently it refuses to print page one of a ms word document which is in two columns </s>
<s> don t know what that is about it prints the other pages fine </s>
<s> i assume i ll find a way to fix this but it s aggravating i miss my old h p </s>
<s> i like to print photos but i also have a lot of work to do that doesn t involve them </s>
<s> i got mine two months ago and i printed out about 10 excellent quality pictures in the first week or so </s>
<s> my ink was at 90 and have not touched it much for maybe to mix in some blue and a tad of yellow in the past two months </s>
<s> slowly they ve been getting low on ink until now which two inks have run out and the rest are at out as well </s>
<s> i haven t printed anything demanding such as photos just black and white text and it went from 90 to 0 </s>
<s> even more frustrating is that it won t even let me print or copy in black and white </s>
<s> and i guess the worse thing of all this is that it won t even let me use the scanner option </s>
<s> i figured since it s not doing any printing it would at least let me scan something but no it keeps asking for ink </s>
<s> it s very disappointing </s>
<s> it may be my fault for not printing much in color but my epson 750 color ink never dried out this quickly </s>
<s> this one shouldn t have either </s>
<s> paul </s>
<s> i am looking for a new printer </s>
<s> i have always had hp printers 4 to date and have been happy </s>
<s> but i am willing to try something new </s>
<s> the epson ink usage thing is not good i was leaning towards an epson until i read this stuff </s>
<s> what about dell </s>
<s> does someone have experience with dell </s>
<s> they seem to get sort of average reviews </s>
<s> i get a very modest discount so if dell had some redeeming features or good words i might head there </s>
<s> is the ink usage problem anything normal or just a fluke like all buicks made on monday have squeaks </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i ve heard that dell printers are made by lexmark and i would stay as far away from them as possible </s>
<s> what about the new epson rx620 that seems to have replaced the rx600 </s>
<s> might be interesting to follow up on that </s>
<s> the rx620 is a little less expensive as well </s>
<s> lexmark and any printer built like them should be banned for sale </s>
<s> i was naive enough to trust a lexmark sales rep at best buy when he lied to my face telling me that the lexmark printer would not print crooked like the previous lexmark i had it did </s>
<s> someone here in los angeles was working on a class action lawsuit against lexmark because so many people had problems with the printers </s>
<s> not sure what happened with that but at least i know that my issues weren t isolated </s>
<s> the top three brands that i would stick to when purchasing printers are hp epson and canon </s>
<s> i am sorry to hear that lexmark is poor quality but that was my gut feel already </s>
<s> sadly i read that lexmark got the contract to build all the dell printers </s>
<s> i think i am going to send an inquiry to dell asking if they have addressed well known quality problems with lexmark printers and see what happens </s>
<s> i ll look at the epsom rx models never have tried one and have no bias at this point </s>
<s> still seeking any input from folks who know </s>
<s> cheers paul berry </s>
<s> i have the 2610 and it works great for me i have never had any problems with it and have for almost 4 months now i suggest hp printers over epson anyday but depending on what u want to do you can choose </s>
