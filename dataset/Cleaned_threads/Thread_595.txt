<s> i just finished building my first pc and i encountered this annoying problem </s>
<s> when i minimize a window on the screen and then go to move the window it moves in segments like it s rolling or under water </s>
<s> it isn t smooth like it normally would be </s>
<s> even a full screen like my yahoo home page when i take scroll bar and move the page it goes in waves </s>
<s> i m not sure if it s a setting that isn t right </s>
<s> i have already checked the smooth scrolling box in internet options and checked the mouse setting 3 frames per click like my other computer </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> my computer system info is as follows mob dfi lanparty ut nf3 250gb cpu amd athlon 64 3200 newcastle socket 754 hd wd 160gb serial ata 150 7200rpm video card ati radeon x700 pro agp 256mb mem ocz ultra high performance dual channel kit 1gig 3200 2 x 512mb monitor viewsonic va1912b os windows xp pro thanks </s>
<s> the only time ive ever gotten that is when windows resets itself back to a very low video setting </s>
<s> go into control panel and check display to see what the card settting is </s>
<s> right click mycomputer gt properties gt advance gt performance gt settings gt visual effects gt then uncheck the quot show window contents while dragging quot box </s>
<s> bells and wistles are fine but if you really want to squeeze more speed from your pc you could select the quot adjust for best performance quot button in this tab and just leave the quot smooth edges of screen fonts quot and quot use common task in folder quot checked </s>
<s> enjoy life is good </s>
