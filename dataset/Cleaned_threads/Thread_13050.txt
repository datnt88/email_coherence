<s> i have a decision to make soon in fact before my grandson comes up for the summer </s>
<s> right now i do alot of genealogy some desk publishing business cards and brochures for my small business manipulate photos with photoshop 5 5 i have a toshiba laptop 1805 and it does the job except i have to hook up a cd burner whenever i want to cut a cd </s>
<s> i am set up wireless with a 5mb line from charter cable </s>
<s> the toshiba is getting old had to reload it twice since xmas but i like xp because this is easy to do </s>
<s> now for the problems 1 i am a former main frame programmer who is frustrated by pc s and all the choices you have to make </s>
<s> 2 i kind of like to sit on my couch and multi task while working on the internet </s>
<s> 3 my grandson is coming up for a few months and since he can t bring his ps 3 he wants to play that wow game here </s>
<s> question do i really need to get a desktop to satisfy both our needs </s>
<s> and which machine would you suggest </s>
<s> i talked to dell because i used to have one and like the onsite repair they offer </s>
<s> he recommended a laptop something about xps or 1505 for about 1300 and a desktop for a few hundred dollars less </s>
<s> i really hate to spend that much at this time any ideas </s>
<s> my daughter in texas bought a emachine at comp usa for a few hundred dollars and is going to add wireless card new video card and more memory or ram since i am not that technically inclined and live in a small town in mi i am not that adventurous </s>
<s> appreciate any ideas or suggestions jq </s>
<s> doing on the pc any specific games </s>
<s> no techie friends </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> a laptop with p 3 that s about 5 yrs old lacking all the bells whistle that a modern one does </s>
<s> ok a modern laptop has built in all the features you not your grandson currently use and some models even exceed them </s>
<s> gaming on a laptop is definitely possible but not for lower powered models </s>
<s> generally a gaming machine requires fast graphics which in turn consume more power and runs hotter and drain batteries faster when not on ac power </s>
<s> you could buy such a laptop for 1500 2000 but you may be better off getting both a lower priced laptop for your use and a desktop for gaming </s>
<s> go to a best buy or circuit city or compusa and check the selections </s>
<s> or get from dell </s>
<s> the major brands generally have good support in spite of occasional lapses </s>
<s> how about this get a laptop now and when your grandson arrives have him play his game to see if it s good enough if not you can walk into the store and pick up a powerful enough desktop at a moment s notice </s>
<s> have fun shopping </s>
<s> grandson is 15 and he was playing some game i think was called wow </s>
<s> something about the war </s>
<s> he was playing against his friend </s>
<s> i would say get a portable computer a xps system is not needed if you want to go dell one of there inpiron systems would do nicely </s>
<s> they tend to be a bit lower end and a bit less expensive </s>
<s> if all you granson would be playing is wow then any of todays systems should be fine </s>
<s> reason why i say portable is because you like to sit at the couch and and be on the computer </s>
<s> thanks for the response it makes sense to me </s>
<s> i will send him a copy janet </s>
