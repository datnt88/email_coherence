<s> my computer was purhcased in 2001 when i received it i got it preinstalled with windows 98se that is the operating system that gets installed if i use the system restore cd </s>
<s> however about 8 months back i did a full new installation of windows xp home edition on this computer </s>
<s> initially the sound was working fine </s>
<s> i didn t use the computer the entire summer </s>
<s> when i switched it on after summer there was no sound output </s>
<s> i changed my speakers checked the wires everything </s>
<s> then i thought maybe it s the driver so i got into the windows update website it showed that i have a newer driver available i decided maybe that would be the key to this but nope after that i got a yellow exclamation mark next to quot c media ac97 audio device quot in device manager </s>
<s> when i use the driver cd i received with my pc it installs quot soundmax integrated digital audio quot </s>
<s> why is it different </s>
<s> even after installing the soundmax drivers i am not getting any sound </s>
<s> i cannot do a rollback of the driver neither can i go back to a system restore point </s>
<s> in add remove programs i have something called c media wdm audio driver when i try to uninstall it says it has been uninstalled but seems to say that every single time i uninstall it after the reboot it still exists can be uninstalled again again </s>
<s> i tried disabling the onboard audio from the bios got the same result </s>
<s> what is going on </s>
<s> how can i get my sound back </s>
<s> btw i think there might be a lot of different drivers of c media ac97 soundamax that were installed so is it cause maybe they all are clashing or something </s>
<s> how could i completely remove all the sound drivers then install the driver from the cd </s>
<s> i ve tried uninstalling it from device manager restarting the computer letting windows install it no success in that </s>
<s> i have a compaq pc which i know has an abit bl30g motherboard however i cannot get the drivers from the abit website because this is an oem motherboard the compaq website does not have any new drivers for this pc </s>
<s> what do i do </s>
<s> i brought a mother board from friend but he didn t gave me the drivers or manuales the mother boards name is bl30g also it is a compaq i only know it from the start up logo if you can send me your computer name which i don t now so i can doawnload driver from the internet </s>

<s> use belarc advisor or everest home edition to get the exact motherboard system board model number </s>

<s> you may also benefit from a bios update if available </s>
