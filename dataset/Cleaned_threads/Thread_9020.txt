<s> i m switching to a mac from a pc and have been trying to decide which model to get </s>
<s> for a number of reasons rational and emotional i ve settled on the imac g5 </s>
<s> i was wondering about the various configurations and this question seems at least a little relevant </s>
<s> if you the collective you had the choice between a 20 quot display with 1gb of memory or a 17 quot display with 1 5gb which side of the equation would you come down on </s>
<s> i think i ve officially entered the nit picky phase of selection </s>
<s> thanks jay </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> i can add ram later </s>
<s> i can t add 3 inches to the display </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i think this is a no contest </s>
<s> as bob rightly pointed out adding 3 quot to an lcd is not possible </s>
<s> adding ram is easy </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> thanks for the replies </s>
<s> they make sense and seem obvious in retrospect one of those why didn t i think of that moments </s>
<s> the original question arose because a colleague at the university where i work said macs are memory intensive </s>
<s> so after looking at the 17 imac on display at the campus store i was ready to order one with 1 5 or 2 gigs of memory </s>
<s> then i made the mistake of visiting a real apple store and seeing one with a 20 monitor and i realized i probably can t afford a big monitor plus 2 gigs of ram </s>
<s> this put me in a tizzy and resulted in my wondering whether i should invest in big memory or big display </s>
<s> do macs need a large amount of memory </s>
<s> is one gig enough for a macintosh that will be used for standard web duties some video and photo editing and the preparation of lectures with powerpoint </s>
<s> i m sorry if i seem obsessive </s>
<s> its just that this is my first foray into macs and i would like to get it at least semi right </s>
<s> i also apologize if this submission appears twice </s>
<s> i sent it from my office but it hadn t appeared as of this evening so i tried again </s>
<s> thanks once more jay </s>
<s> your choice of mac with a gig of ram will do everything you ask of it </s>
<s> having said that you can never have too much ram but for right now and the job description you are set </s>
<s> go get it and enjoy it p </s>
<s> i m convinced </s>
<s> should i order the wireless keyboard and mouse or stick with the default wired units </s>
<s> i ve read that some don t like apple s mouse and use aftermarket products </s>
<s> i m still not sure about the difference between bluetooth and wireless but is a bluetooth enabled keyboard and mouse worthwhile technology </s>
<s> i ll probably install virex if only to keep from transmitting viruses with email </s>
<s> do i need to use an antispyware program periodically </s>
<s> i presently spend the first 15 minutes of my day clearing spyware that counterspy detects on my pc </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> jay </s>
<s> bluetooth is a short range wireless signal usually for input devices like the keyboard mouse headsets joysticks and some printers </s>
<s> it s pretty neat </s>
<s> by ordering it built into your system you will not have to take up a usb port should you decide to go with it in the future </s>
<s> the apple mouse has only one button as source of much discussion in the mac world but os x has built in support for a two button mouse including a third party bluetooth one </s>
<s> i know of no anti spyware programs for the mac i m sure there are some out there but spyware and malware are not currently a problem on the mac </s>
<s> the majority of the stuff is aimed at windows boxes </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> i went all the way with imac 20 quot screen and 2 gigs of memory </s>
<s> i read on the apple site that with matched memory sticks quot it will operate with a 128 bit data path quot instead of the 64 one dimm would support </s>
<s> sounds good to me </s>
<s> i look forward to learning the system and putting all that power to use </s>
<s> thanks again jay </s>
<s> i m sat here using a mere macmini with 512mb ram and a 20 cinema display and for the majority of what i actually do with my machine it is more than adequate </s>
<s> while it is almost certainly slower and less slick than any g5 based machine performance feels better than the pc in the other room with a roughly similar spec 512mb 1 3mhz cpu </s>
<s> then again i ve sussed that most of my wife and i s pc usage is very light hence going for a mac mini rather than something with a top end graphics card </s>
<s> i am not heavily using photoshop and when i do i am not usually working at photo quality and i haven t started heavily using imovie garageband or idvd </s>
<s> the first time i hit the constraints of the machine was using garageband but i was testing how much i could do before it gave up and that was cpu rather than memory </s>
<s> simcity didn t seem to enjoy running at the highest resolution i ve not done any investigation there my hunch is that it graphics card as 32mb is the bare minimum suggested </s>
<s> if you do a lot of photoshop work or a v editing then the more ram the better </s>
