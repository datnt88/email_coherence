<s> you may have to poke a hole in order to remotely connect </s>
<s> what do you mean how do i do that </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> when going through a router ports need to be opened and destinations ip locales have to be assigned </s>
<s> you also have to allow remote access to the users who are going to be using remote connection on your network that s why you are not able to connect you need to do the same setup in each computer you must go to system then remote then allow access to each user who is going to be using remote connection on each pc </s>
