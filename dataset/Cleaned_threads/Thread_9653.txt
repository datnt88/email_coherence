<s> hi i m driving myself nuts over this problem </s>
<s> i have a belkin pre n router and a dell inspiron 1505 with the 1500 draft n card </s>
<s> i keep dropping connection totally </s>
<s> i know that the belkin isn t a compatible router using the 802 11n speeds </s>
<s> when i plug into the router or modem i have no problems </s>
<s> when i do drop the connection when i go to the available wireless networks list i see my router but when i try to connect it says that i have a low wireless signal problem </s>
<s> i have verified with another computer running xp pro tablet edition and the connection doesn t seem to drop out the couple times i have noticed it </s>
<s> btw i have vista home premium any ideas </s>
<s> if i need to buy a new router that isn t a problem </s>
<s> these are the routers that are quot approved quot so to speak netgear wnr834b linksys wrt300n buffalo wzr g300n thanks folks </s>
<s> ya ll have been very helpful in the past and appreciate that very much </s>
<s> drives us nuts </s>
<s> be sure to try not to trip up the connection by other well meaning advice such as disabling the ssid broadcast </s>
<s> start with no encryption and see if it works </s>
<s> also don t get too far away from the wifi router plus have current drivers </s>
<s> one dropper was cured recently by using or not using the native windows wzc service </s>
<s> let s see if we can find that </s>
<s> in that case wzc was not helping </s>
<s> hope this helps bob </s>
<s> thank you for your advice </s>
<s> i fell victim to the ssid broadcasting thing i changed it back and so far it s stayed online </s>
<s> i have vista so i m pretty sure that the dell wireless isn t running i checked the task manager and i don t believe it is running </s>
<s> i m pretty sure that vista takes complete control over the connection as with everything else </s>
<s> i checked the dell website for driver updates and there aren t any </s>
<s> i did briefly chat with a rep and they said that they are working on an updated driver for my wifi card because they said there were having quot issues quot with it and audio </s>
<s> fun times </s>
<s> well thank you </s>
<s> if i notice anything at all i will put another post up </s>
<s> oh and i have read the billions of posts about draft n and pre n i am contemplating buying another router to take advantage of the quot draft n quot speeds </s>
<s> it s been too many times i ve flipped ssid back on and the connection just works </s>
<s> it s not a big security item but moving to wpa is helpful here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yeah i did switch over to wpa security </s>
<s> i was originally using wep and had many many problems </s>
<s> wpa has definitely helped in that aspect of it </s>
<s> hopefully is stays up and running for me </s>
<s> do you all suggest that i go and get a new router to take advantage of the quot n quot speeds or should i just wait for quot n quot to be ratified </s>
<s> it appears you may have cured the basic issue but to get pre n and draft n up to speed most of us learned we had to stick with one maker for it to work </s>
<s> i m still on 802 11g </s>
<s> not changing since it s still working fine here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well that could be a problem seeing as how i have a dell wireless card </s>
<s> i know on the dell website they advertise sell linksys netgear and d link </s>
<s> my girlfriend and myself often send files over the network to each other </s>
<s> i know that using a usb drive would probably solve my problem but just wondering what your folks thought </s>
<s> has anyone had good experiences with the dell draft n card and a particular router </s>
<s> btw thanks bob for all of your help </s>
<s> to buy a compatible draft n router now versus using g until n is ratified search for connect with centrino routers since your dell card is intel s n </s>
<s> hey thanks </s>
<s> do we have a timeline until n is ratified </s>
<s> than trying to guess when the fed will lower interest rate but still risky to bet on it </s>
<s> judge for yourself if this appears to be a fast action group </s>
<s> hey folks </s>
<s> i m back </s>
<s> i just logged on this morning and the wireless wouldn t connect </s>
<s> it wouldn t even see the router sometimes </s>
<s> then when it did it saw two of them </s>
<s> i haven t changed a thing since it started working again </s>
<s> right now i am plugged in and its working fine </s>
<s> in all honesty could it be the router </s>
<s> my girlfriend is having the same problem on her new e1505 running vista </s>
<s> i m pulling my hair out what little i have </s>
<s> thank you soo much for all your help </s>
<s> you have been awesome </s>
<s> try another wifi channel </s>
<s> it your laptop or router offers it scan for available networks and note which channels are in use in your area </s>
<s> choose which is not used </s>
<s> if you see networks on 6 and 11 then use 1 etc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi folks </s>
<s> i just got off the phone with a couple of dell technicians and i was told that the reason that my network is bouncing is because of my belkin router </s>
<s> so i have to go out and buy a new one </s>
<s> here is my question for all of you </s>
<s> now i have a belkin router that isn t going to be used </s>
<s> is there a way to hook both up so that i can extend my wireless signal </s>
<s> i know that s pretty silly to ask but i am just trying to find something to do with the belkin </s>
<s> thanks folks </s>
<s> this may be a little late but i had problems with my belkin pre n router dropping connections </s>
<s> i updated the firmware and the problems went away </s>
<s> i wasn t connecting using pre n or draft n cards i was using d link g and apple b cards but the new firmware solved the problems </s>
<s> my belkin pre n router has been rock solid ever since </s>
<s> you can download the firmware update from here </s>
<s> the latest firmware version is 1 01 03 you can see what version you currently have on your router if you hit the router s internal webserver </s>
<s> instructions for updating the firmware are in the manual on page 69 this may not solve your problems because you are connecting to a pre n router with a draft n card from different manufactures but it may allow you to drop down to g b speeds reliably </s>
<s> cheers y </s>
