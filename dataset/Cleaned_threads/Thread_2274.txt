<s> i was backing up some of my dvds recently and noticed that it took an extremely long time to burn them </s>
<s> lets just say it usually took about 40min total to copy onto the harddrive and burn a dvd </s>
<s> now it takes over 80 min </s>
<s> this was pretty abrupt </s>
<s> ive defragged scanned for everything </s>
<s> not sure what else to do </s>
<s> dont know if this matters but theres about 30gb of space left on my 120gb harddrive but this never prevented a faster burn before </s>
<s> win xp p4 2 8ghz 512mb ram </s>
<s> i select recording at 1 2 the media or drive speed whichever is lowest because quot i ve learned the lesson quot maybe a good thing </s>
<s> also the dvd may be copy protected and it takes longer </s>

<s> i forgot to mention this before but before it suddenly slowed down i was able to use the internet play music seamlessly the burning process didnt take any longer than usual </s>
<s> but i will try to burn a disc at 1 2 speed </s>
<s> type xp dma into google com and consider setting the channels to pio and back to dma as noted in the first article from microsoft </s>
<s> sorry but the details are so thin in your posts that i can t offer much </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry to resurrect a dead thread but i totally forgot about this forum </s>
<s> i tried the dma trick to no avail </s>
<s> so lets see more info i use several burning software and it ranges from jetaudio to nero to dvd shrink all of which have noticably added about 10 minutes to the burning process </s>
<s> im not sure if ive mentioned this before but i used to be able to multitask alot while burning dvds but now just to be sure that the burn comes out without errors i have to refrain from strenuous activity </s>
<s> for example i could listen to music play a flash game burn a dvd and surf the web with no slow down at the same time </s>
<s> now i justsurf the web when when im burning something theres still a slowdown </s>
<s> is this slowdown normal </s>
<s> it s very normal </s>
<s> and if the owner isn t watching every update they may miss what caused the change </s>
<s> for instance an update to norton caused some sluggish email performance one day </s>
<s> so off with norton and in with something else </s>
<s> gotta pay attention since i can t guess what you installed </s>
