<s> crucial and memorystore com scans confirm i have acer motherboard em61sm em61pm and recommend ddr2 800 and ddr2 1066 </s>

<s> i have four banks two in use one each with 512mb so was going to add two 1gb and leave the two 512mb for a total of 3mb </s>
<s> tells me i have pc2 5300 333mhz i guess the pc2 6400 is compatible but will only perform at the max speed of the 5300 </s>
<s> sound right </s>
<s> didn t find anything that helped me with 1 8v 2 2 vs 1 9 2 0v issue though </s>
<s> can t locate mb info with just the mb number need the system name series and model number </s>
<s> ram voltage depends on what the mb and chipset support </s>
<s> product information for aca ast180 ud400a it is actually my secondary desktop for wife and child </s>
<s> i have xps 410 with 2gb and was going to maybe just stick the two from the xps into the acer and then buy four matching 1gb memory to put in and max out my xps </s>
<s> for now just need to know if in the original question if the ocz memory i bought is compatible with the acer and then i will work on what is compatible with my xps next </s>
<s> unit identified there s no way to give an educated guess on whether it will work or not </s>
<s> some mb are very sensitive to ram voltage while others almost anything goes </s>
<s> i looked on the acer site for aspire ast180 ud400a and could not find any product info none </s>
<s> i m also guessing there s no option in the bios to increase or reduce ram voltage so you re at a disadvantage there </s>
<s> all i can say for the moment is you can try it and see if it works </s>
<s> accurate reliable answers to questions like yours are often not as simple as yes or no </s>
<s> ergo the reason for the questions </s>
<s> also be aware there are issues using 4gb of ram on winxp 32 bit version </s>
<s> unless you really need 4gb ram in the xps it may be better to skip that for now or until you get an os than handles it properly xp 64 bit or perhaps some version of vista </s>

<s> now i can see where the processor voltage is 1 8v and i am guessing logic would say that the memory voltage should is probably 1 8v as well </s>
<s> i only plan on putting 3gb of memory in each system though i do have xp 64bit available </s>
<s> i don t use an actual dual boot but rather two seperate hdd s and just use the bios set up to turn one on one off and switch back and forth between xp and vista </s>
<s> next time i need to do a clean reinstall on the xp hdd maybe i will put the xp 64 bit but no real plans on needing 4gb of memory </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> believe the cpu voltage for the acer machine with the am2 processor should be 1 25 1 35v </s>

<s> little or no potential of harming the mb or any other part of the cpu </s>
