<s> hi there in my apple macbook 13 inch core2 duo laptop i have a small disc stuck in the drive </s>
<s> i was going to read quot roughguide quot information provided by my travel agent to look at the maps and the rest </s>
<s> it is on a 8cm disc which says that it could be used in the mac </s>
<s> i inserted it in my macbook s drive and hoped to succeed </s>
<s> i did not </s>
<s> it is in the slot it does not engage in any contact and it does not come out whatever method i use </s>
<s> it appears that i will have to open the case to reach the drive to get it out </s>
<s> how do i go about it </s>
<s> help will be appreciated </s>
<s> shafiq </s>
<s> and get them to remove it </s>
<s> before you do that shut down the laptop and remove the ac power cord </s>
<s> with the cd slot facing down shake the laptop and see if you can coax the disk into appearing enough for you to grab it with a pair of tweezers </s>
<s> i would not recommend attempting to take this thing apart to get at the optical drive </s>
<s> a quick glance at the instructions that came with your laptop would have told you that only regular sized cd dvd disks can go into a slot loading optical drive </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> thank you p for your advice </s>
<s> on this occasion i did not follow it </s>
<s> i looked for information where ever i could find it </s>
<s> i found it on the you tube </s>
<s> a clever gentleman had a whole lot of information on a lot of apple laptops </s>
<s> i just looked at his video commentary a couple of times then left it </s>
<s> then i looked it at the website ifixit com where i found step by step text with photographs </s>
<s> i went through it a couple of times </s>
<s> the end result was that i decided to do it myself </s>
<s> i have not done a lot of computer work however i have been using them for more years than many </s>
<s> there is no scare factor for me </s>
<s> the only problem i have is that i forget the procedures of very familiar things if i am not using the procedure for a couple of months it only happened in my early 70s it is a few years since so i am used to it </s>
<s> so i usually have to learn it afresh my hands are steady and my brain usually works if a challenge is to be faced </s>
<s> so i went through the video and the text with photographs </s>
<s> i cleared my study table in some places it had gathered some considerable dust well the study desk clear and clean with a bed sheet for cover and a couple of screw drivers of the appropriate size i sat down to take on the job </s>
<s> yes there was a bit of apprehension as one would experience facing a new situation but no fear of mortal danger a foolhardy silly belief that i can handle it </s>
<s> i had written the text notes on a piece of paper </s>
<s> i went through it one by one </s>
<s> making sure that i put the small screws in some sensible order so that i do not forget to put them back in the right places </s>
<s> one hour and twenty minutes i got the 3 quot disc out and i am using the same computer to tell the tale i guess if i have to do it again half an hour will be enough </s>
<s> thank you for being there which gives me the confidence that i can seek help when stuck </s>
<s> yours shafiq </s>
<s> i m impressed </s>
<s> it is a daunting proposition to take apart something as complex and compact as a laptop </s>
<s> well done glad you have the offending disk extracted p </s>
