<s> just got a brand new hp pavilian dv5 notebook </s>
<s> everything is fine </s>
<s> except i can hear clock ticking sound from hard drive constantly </s>
<s> it is not exactly one second per click but very similar </s>
<s> when hard drive is working hard it makes normal sound </s>
<s> when it is kind of idle it is ticking </s>
<s> is this normal </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i take it back </s>
<s> i thought when hard drive is working there is no ticking sound </s>
<s> but i was wrong i think it is still there just that normal busy sound of hard drive seems overpowered that ticking sound </s>
<s> and see if the sound is there </s>
<s> if not continue to boot into safe mode and take a second listen </s>
<s> if the sound is only heard when windows fully loads it s a background process accessing the hard drive </s>
<s> what process that is may not be simple to find </s>
<s> these aren t unusual </s>
<s> your computer just doesn t always sit there and wait for you to input something </s>
<s> it does stuff on it s own </s>
