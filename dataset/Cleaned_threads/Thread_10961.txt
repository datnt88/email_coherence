<s> will i damage my computer if i replace my current 250w power supply with a 300w or higher model </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> amount of current that they need </s>
<s> the voltages out of the supply to the devices is precisely regulated for voltage 5 12 3 3 thus the devices have no idea how much power the supply could provide </s>
<s> based on a standard supply not a proprietary system such as the old dells which used different wiring in the same connector </s>
<s> make sure it is the correct replacement type </s>
<s> you didn t mention anything of your system </s>
<s> but installing a higher wattage unit is ok provided the connections are the same type etc here is ahelpful site that may explain further good luck willy </s>
