<s> i recently bought the netgear wg 511v2 wifi card for my dell latitude lap top with win xp pro operating system </s>
<s> prior to this card i have used belkins and linksys cards with no problems at all </s>
<s> ever since i have installed this card i continue to face problems when i try to put the laptop on stand by or shut down nothing happens i have to hold down the power button for a few seconds to shut off the machine which is of course not the best way to work the computer </s>
<s> i have tried removing the wifi card restarting the machine and trying to put the laptop on stand by and all of it works just perfect </s>
<s> i have a feeling its got to do with the new card </s>
<s> any help will be appreciated </s>
<s> one offered here </s>
<s> i returned it for a model i know works </s>
<s> driver updates didn t cure it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes the firmware was the first thing i looked at and it is the most recent version </s>
<s> bob thanks for your feedback i guess i will have to do the same by the way it s been a while since i logged on here </s>
<s> it s good to see you are still around showing directions to us that are lost </s>
