<s> i wanted to upgrade my winxp home built system with a new mobo and cpu </s>
<s> but when it tries to start it almost gets to the winxp screen and then it restarts </s>
<s> it keeps doing this over and over until i shut it down </s>
<s> someone told me that you can t use the same hard drive that was used in a winxp system </s>
<s> but all of the hardware except mobo and cpu are the same </s>
<s> sometimes i almost miss win98 i have all of my software and documents there and i hate to wipe it and start over from scratch </s>
<s> can i set it as a slave in my upgraded system or will this not work either </s>
<s> the new mobo and cpu are just sitting in the box </s>
<s> i had them checked out at a computer shop to make sure they were ok and they checked out fine </s>
<s> i appreciate any help </s>
<s> yes you can set it as a slave </s>
<s> you also could put it on the other ide channel other cable as a master or slave </s>
<s> the current installation of xp on the old hd is expecting the old motherboard and its bios </s>
<s> that causes major problems </s>
<s> boot to the xp cd and perform a repair installation of windows </s>
<s> hopefully you have a backup of your important files in cast there is a problem with the repair installation </s>
<s> i will give it a try </s>
<s> i will backup my files first then give it a try </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
