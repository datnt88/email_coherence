<s> help my flat monitor screen is now quot wavy quot whenever i scroll up and down on a page </s>
<s> i don t know why this started or how to end it </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> redrover start with connecting a good old crt in stead of the lcd to see what happens </s>
<s> it s an easy swap </s>
<s> if that s ok i suspect the monitor itself </s>
<s> if that s wavy either i suspect the videocard or the driver but that s a rather theoretical option i think </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> wavy </s>
<s> like a narrow large s on the left and right </s>
<s> or it waves as you scroll as you said </s>
<s> this usually means you don t have enough video power video ram pics and web pages should also take a bit to load all the way down </s>
<s> this usually happens with 2mb maybe 4mb vram </s>
<s> download and use aida32 utility to check a flat screen doesn t need more vram so the previous idea of another monitor crt is good quick </s>
<s> xp </s>
<s> w98 </s>
<s> directx 8 1 or above </s>
<s> it waves as i scroll up and down on a page </s>
<s> it s supposed to be smooth </s>
<s> i have to stop scrolling for the wave to catch up so i can read what s on the page </s>
<s> i have windows xp </s>
<s> redrover check drivers first then try to slow down the hwd acceleration </s>
<s> display properties gt settings gt advance open troubleshoot tab gt slow down hwd acceleration slider is in middle of window </s>
<s> this happened to my main system after upgrade to geforce2 mx mx400 video card and third monitor </s>
<s> the effect was only on this card and attached monitor </s>
<s> bill </s>
<s> i formatted the drive in my sons s gateway laptop after backing up all data </s>
<s> after installing xp pro and office 2003 and running all updates i discovered the same wavy screen </s>
<s> the device manager showed the vga graphics drivers missing </s>
<s> the correct driver would not download to this workstation </s>
<s> i downloaded and transferred across the network </s>
<s> the file extracted </s>
<s> i then pointed the driver reinstall to the cab files for this download and it installed falwlessly </s>
<s> no more wavy screen and the device mgr shows the drivers to be intact </s>
<s> he also runs a second monitor crt flat screen and it works fine </s>
<s> one neat trick is if you do not want the laptop monitor on crank up the resolution where the laptop monitor cannot perform and it will shutdown </s>
<s> now you can use only the crt external if need be </s>
<s> i turned the slider all the way to the left and now the scrolling is perfect thanx for the fix mg </s>
