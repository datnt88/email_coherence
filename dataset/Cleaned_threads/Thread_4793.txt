<s> i have a 1 1 duron </s>
<s> i would like to upgrade to a 2 8 athlon xp my motherboard manual says support socket a 462 pins for amd athlon athlon xp duron </s>
<s> would it be ok to buy this processor and fit it </s>
<s> would i need a cooler </s>
<s> if so what kind </s>
<s> i would like to buy 512mb of kingstom ram to put into my other slot </s>
<s> would it be compatible with my old ram </s>
<s> also it will be a pc3200 and my motherboard only says compatible with pc1600 pc2100 </s>
<s> would this be ok </s>
<s> i know it s a lot of questions but i would be very grateful it someone could help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> power consumption </s>
<s> certainly will need a good hsf </s>
<s> if you buy the cpu retail it comes with a hsf and 3 year warranty oem warranty is quot not doa quot up to 90 days normally and must buy the hsf separately for any warranty </s>
<s> very good chance that you would need a new power supply </s>
<s> the pc 3200 will likely run but only at the pc 1600 or 2100 speed that you set the memory bus speed to </s>
<s> the cpu will probably run but not at it s rated speed </s>
<s> the multiplier in the cpu is fixed setting the multiplier on the mobo will have no effect if your memory speed doesn t match the fsb </s>
<s> i m not sure what fsb that cpu can run at </s>
<s> your manual or mtrbd </s>
<s> support website will clearly explain what highest cpu that mtrbd </s>
<s> can support </s>
<s> further you may need to update the bios in order to spport any newer cpu or devices as the case maybe since you brought the system mtrbd </s>
<s> so it pays to visit the support anyways to get the latest facts </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> price a new motherboard and accessories as well in the long run it may end up being cheaper </s>
