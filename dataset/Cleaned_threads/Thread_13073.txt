<s> hi i just received my new ph and wanted to add an 80gb hdd to it </s>
<s> my question concerns the drive i got it at a yard sale and was wondering if there was a way to make sure that it didn t contain viruses </s>
<s> will formatting it in the ph erase any potentially harmful material or do i risk infecting just by hooking it up </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> format removes all threats and all data </s>
<s> get a program called killdisk </s>
<s> it will wipe the hard drive clean </s>
<s> formatting wont </s>
<s> will destroy all data </s>
<s> recoverable </s>
<s> maybe </s>
<s> but who would want to recover a virus </s>
<s> to remove potentially dangerous data and install an os formatting is all that is needed </s>
<s> thanks for the info </s>
<s> he bought a hard drive at a yard sale </s>
<s> i think that warrants completely destroying everything on it </s>
<s> i think i will try this just to make sure b c as you said i did purchase these at a sale </s>
