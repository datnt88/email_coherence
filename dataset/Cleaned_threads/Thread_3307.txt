<s> i am having some issues with my samsung hd 501 jk internal that came installed in my hp pavillion a6500f </s>
<s> i am very concerned that it is about to die </s>
<s> after a little searching i have read that even the replacements that samsung sends out are junk </s>
<s> any suggestions on a different hd of similar size speed to replace it with </s>
<s> quite frankly there just isn t that many hd makers </s>
<s> off the top of my head there is seagate wd samsung hitatci and maxtor </s>
<s> seagate now owns samsung a as well as maxtor </s>
<s> any other label out there maybe a quot rebadged quot hd is different from those listed </s>
<s> i have found seagate to do well to include wd brands </s>
<s> i xclude any ext </s>
<s> mounted drives and any 2 5in </s>
<s> as well also anything ssd based </s>
<s> tada willy i </s>
<s> i also had the same concern with my hp pavillion a 6500f not too long ago and i decided it was time to get a replacement for my hd </s>
<s> i bought a western digital re3 wd5002abys 01b1b0 from here it has been working wonders for me </s>
<s> its a similar spec as the samsung but personally think wd is more reliable than samsung s in the hd market </s>
