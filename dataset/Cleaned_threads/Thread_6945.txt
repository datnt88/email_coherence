<s> hi all appreciate if someone could please advise me at what price will i be able to sell my lenovo ideapad s9e which i bought in june 09 for 8364 320 00 thanks all </s>
<s> the best thing to do is to check the price for a comparable laptop at the usual second hand sites in your country </s>
<s> a three year old netbook without warranty can t be worth much </s>
<s> if it s the cheapest one i see it has atom n270 processor 512 mb 8 9 quot screen 80 gb hard disk xp home 3 cell battery the original one </s>
<s> let s say 25 euro s </s>
<s> maybe 50 but not more </s>

<s> hi kees thanks for your reply </s>
<s> i had browse through and could not find any comparable lap tops in any irish websites </s>
<s> it has 1gb hd memory </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the model make does not have to match to be one you are comparing </s>
