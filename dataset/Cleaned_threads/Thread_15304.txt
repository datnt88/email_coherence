<s> i d like to upgrade my video card as it can t play new games very smoothly and seems to be the bottleneck here are the specs i d like to stay under 150 but i d be willing to go a bit over i was thinking a 8800 gt </s>

<s> whoops 8120n again if you have issues after you install a stand alone vid card in that unit you should look into a stronger psu to preclude problems and possible component failures </s>
