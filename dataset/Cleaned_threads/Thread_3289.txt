<s> i am upgrading from a sony trinitron to probably a sony or dell 19 quot flat panel </s>
<s> my video card is 3 yrs old but works very well with my current monitor </s>
<s> what card would you recommend i upgrade to or is it necessary </s>
<s> the monitor will probably run around 400 so i don t want to spend too much or i might as well just buy a new computer </s>
<s> thank in advance roy </s>
<s> your post told so little that its unlikely that you will find a ready answer </s>

<s> using a 3 year old dell pc with a 32mb nvidia geforce2 mx 4x agp graphics card </s>
<s> running windows xp hope this is enough extra info </s>

<s> what about the rest of the system </s>
<s> there s no use in getting an x850 xtpe if all you have is a p3 933 i ll go ahead and say that when getting a 19 quot lcd screen be very careful </s>
<s> make sure to buy one with a response time of under 16ms or else you ll get major ghosting in game as most 19 quot lcd monitors do </s>
<s> i m assuming you have a mid range to weak computer so i ll suggest a 9600xt </s>
<s> dell dimension 8100 series pentium 4 1 5ghz 256 rdram window xp </s>
<s> have wireless internet if that matters </s>
<s> thanks roy </s>
<s> who said you had to go out and buy another graphics card </s>
<s> hook it up new monitor and see how it looks and runs </s>
