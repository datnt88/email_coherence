<s> thank you </s>
<s> across virually all windows platforms that says the computer failed to find the operating system </s>
<s> it does that by looking for a few vital but hidden system files on the hard drive if it can t find these you get the quot ntldr not found quot nt loader error </s>
<s> if you ve just installed the operating system from cd without any problems it s a good indicator that you ll likely have to enter your computer bios and set boot quot hard drive 1 quot first </s>
<s> it s likely set to quot boot from cd quot at the moment which dending on hardware can stop the system booting from hard drive even if that is listed as another boot option </s>
<s> good luck geebee </s>
