<s> ok here s the deal </s>
<s> i have 4 pc s i m going to number them for practical reasons 1 desktop windows xp 2 dekstop windows xp 3 desktop windows vista 4 laptop windows xp no </s>
<s> 1 is connected through usb with a level one router </s>
<s> the router is connected via ethernet cable with the linksys wireless g access point </s>
<s> nos </s>
<s> 2 and 3 both have wireless g pci cards also linksys and 4 the laptop had its own wireless card already installed i don t remember the brand </s>
<s> after a lot of trouble and help both from live chat and the telephone line of linksys i managed to set up the wireless network </s>
<s> everythinkg worked great except for pc 3 the signal was too low because this pc was the farthest away </s>
<s> so i decided to buy the linksys wireless g range expander </s>
<s> i disabled my wep protection and pressed the auto config button but nothing happened </s>
<s> the link light remained red </s>
<s> after lots of hours trying to figure it out the technical support advised me to upgrade the firmware first in the access point and the range expander </s>
<s> after doing that they suggested i give the static ip of 196 168 1 10 to the access point and 192 168 1 11 to the range expander or vice versa 10 to the expader and 11 to the ap </s>
<s> sorry i ve done this so many times i m not sure now </s>
<s> i did all that and yes the wireless network worked like a charm even in the remote pc 3 internet connection working the range expander lights both blue everything 100 alright </s>
<s> some time at that afternoon i tried to do some port forwarding to get bit torrent to work messed everything up so i restored the factory defaults made the ip settings again and presto everything worked well </s>
<s> it only lasted one day </s>
<s> today the link light is again red and pc 3 vista detectes the wireless but doesn t have any internet access </s>
<s> also it says something like quot restricted quot or something similar i have greek vista </s>
<s> also pc 2 has lost internet access as well although it does detect the wireless and connects to it </s>
<s> finally the pc 3 s ip has changed </s>
<s> i used ipconfig and while the ip was 192 168 1 104 while everything was working now it s a completely different number </s>
<s> i suppose the problem is in the ip s i d like to ask if it s best to let an auto configuration or do i have to enter specific ip addresses to the 4 pc s </s>
<s> of course the expander worked just right the first day i made it work and the ip s were automatically assigned </s>
<s> i don t know what changed </s>
<s> is there something i m not doing right or anything i should check </s>
<s> i even changed the channels in case there was interference but nothing </s>
<s> ssid is the same everywhere and enabled wep is disabled again but it just won t work </s>
<s> should i enter the ip addresses manually and if so which ones and where or do something else </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> for some unknown reason the setup cd won t run under vista </s>
<s> quot no </s>
<s> 1 is connected through usb with a level one router </s>
<s> the router is connected via ethernet cable quot i ve found this to be unreliable when both the usb and ethernet is used </s>
<s> no one i know will support such </s>
<s> yes some find it works but support staff will usually disregard pleas for help when it doesn t work </s>
<s> you may be another victim of an issue i discuss at this link gt frankly it s quite a mess so the only setup i am able to get to work today in areas this is occurring is to enable ssid i don t know why people thought that disabling it gave more security then move to wpa </s>
<s> it may take a day or two for the attacker to give up and get off your system </s>
<s> remember they are likely spoofing the mac address and wreaking havoc on the airwaves your wifi network </s>
<s> so a move to wpa and enabling ssid is not going to work instantly </s>
<s> so far the longest it too was 3 days for the pest attacker to give up and change their mac address to go bother someone else </s>
<s> in a nutshell </s>
<s> ssid enabled </s>
<s> wpa yes </s>
<s> forget wep </s>
<s> it s dead </s>
<s> gt i read your post twice and maybe i missed it </s>
<s> where is the expander </s>
<s> it needs to be just about halfway to the remote systems </s>
<s> and how far is that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t think it has anything to do with hacking cause i m 100 sure nobody in this neighborhood even has any wireless equipment also i m not sure i wrote this right the router is connected with usb to the pc and the access point connects to the router via ethernet </s>
<s> this router had only one ethernet slot and it had to be taken by the ap so i couldn t use it to connect to the pc </s>
<s> the shop i got it from reassured me it would work and true enough before the range expander everything worked well except the remote pc due to signal </s>
<s> i got ssid enabled and until i get this to work i have disabled all protection </s>
<s> now the distance between the ap and the expander is not that big at all i d say about 5 10 m max </s>
<s> with concrete walls in between </s>
<s> and since it did work for a whole day signal quality was excellent too </s>
<s> i don t understand what s stopping it now </s>
<s> the only thing i didn t write about is better antennas </s>
<s> my advice on security and the issue we re seeing is not applicable to you i have to write that s fine and good luck </s>
