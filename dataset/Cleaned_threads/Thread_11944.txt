<s> hi i have been trying to connect my laptop windows vista and my netbook windows 7 with a crossover cable and i have followed every single step of the instructions i have found on the net including disabling windows firewall but it won t do it and when i try to ping the failure seems to be when the netbook tries to ping the laptop 100 loss </s>
<s> any advice </s>
<s> what could the problem be </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> yep it should work </s>
<s> the situation that it works with both devices having indirect connection via a router is much more common </s>
<s> so i d try to get that working first </s>
<s> and then you might find that the direct connection works also </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks but unfortunately i don t have a router i only have a normal modem maybe it would be easier if the os were the same although theoretically it should also work with vista and windows 7 </s>
<s> why not try with a friend or family member that has one </s>
<s> both the netbook and the laptop are portable </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i have found a thread somewhere on the net that mentioned a solution not mentioned anywhere else and it worked </s>
<s> it worked also for the other people in the thread </s>
<s> they say to just write the ip of the other computer in the default gateway the ip that is automatically assigned although you could also assign it manually i did it for both computers and it worked although i had not shared all folders so only a few were shared but both computers appeared in the network </s>
<s> the root of your issue is you have no way to get an ip address on your pcs without doing it manually </s>
<s> so you do it just that way </s>
<s> you give each a quot static quot address </s>
<s> they must both be withing a compatible range and you don t need a gateway address </s>
<s> the most simple way would be to use the old ms convention for lan use </s>
<s> set one to ip 192 168 0 1 and the other to ip 192 168 0 2 set the subnet mask for both to 255 255 255 0 your pcs should now happily connect </s>
<s> this doesn t mean you can access or move files yet </s>
<s> you need to set up file sharing and create at least one user one both pcs that share their username and password </s>
<s> it s also best if these are in the admin group </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> hi yes that s what i had found on the net and what i had done but it didn t work </s>
<s> i don t know if it is because the os are not the same or because the laptop and the network card in it are a bit old about 5 years </s>
<s> if you connect the two computers with the crossover cable and then try ipconfig all i think that s what it was i found this info on the net too you will find out the automatic ip address assigned by the crossover cable </s>
<s> it won t appear if you just try ncpa cpl but it is there i also tried those ip addresses you mention the subnet masks but the only thing that worked was adding the ip address of the other computer in the default gateway i found this solution quot hidden quot in a thread so obviously not a well known solution but it worked </s>
