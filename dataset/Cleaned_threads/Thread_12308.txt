<s> which is your favorite hard drive brand and why </s>
<s> personally i am a avid fan and user of wd so that makes it my favorite brand </s>
<s> to me it is reliable and stable </s>
<s> pricing wise is reasonable </s>
<s> well i always shop for my computer needs on newegg </s>
<s> and when it comes time for me to get a hard drive i look at the reviews storage capacity price and see what i can get for the best bang for my buck </s>
<s> i always try to stick to wd and seagate though </s>
<s> right now i ve been using seagate and i haven t had any problems </s>
<s> i ve been using western digital </s>
<s> it s reliable and the products i m using are surpassing my expectations </s>
<s> i buy the one that gives me the best bangs for the bucks </s>
<s> so far no regret </s>
<s> today they all are pretty reliable and for me it boils down to cost </s>
<s> realiablity is really just a matter of luck and if you are unlucky no matter which brand you choose could end up being flaky </s>
<s> but i don t care hard drive are cheap and as long as i got my data backed up i have no worries </s>
<s> just my 2 cents </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s> i have been useing seagate s since well so long cant remember mid 80 s in the begining lol the wd s used to be a joke but i think seagate bought them so by now they should be up to seagate quality </s>
<s> first choice is always wd great reliability performance and longevity at very good prices </s>
<s> fallback choices hitachi and samsung for 2 5 quot drives and seagate for 3 5 quot but only when i can t source a wd </s>
<s> more to the point seagate with 5 year warranty </s>
<s> i ve been using these drives for a long time </s>
<s> to get the 5 year warranty one has to purchase enterprise class drives or retail box drives that are labeled quot 5 year warranty quot seagate also sells drives with 1 and 3 year warranties mostly into the oem and external markets </s>
<s> maxtor is now owned by seagate </s>
<s> still only carries a 3 year warranty on retail packaging </s>
<s> seagate bought maxtor </s>
<s> western digital is still their own company </s>
<s> their product has improved radically in the last several years especially with high performance drives like the raptor family </s>
<s> getting too old sorry wd lol i used to love hearing when a drive went down and was maxtor </s>
<s> made a lot of money installing new seagates </s>
<s> good ol error 1701 </s>
<s> in the last 6 years i ve had two hitachi two wd and two samsung drives die on me </s>
<s> in their defense the wd and samsung drives were over 60 degrees c in a poorly ventilated case which is beyond the rated temperature but i m placing my bets on my two fairly new seagate drives for now </s>
<s> i have yet to see a recent seagate maxtor drive die </s>
<s> i think the last bad seagate i saw was an 80 mb 5 25 quot </s>
<s> yes megabyte </s>
<s> you are dateing us i bought the newest fastest available to increase from 10mb to 20mb </s>
<s> for the past several years i have used nothing but seagate cheetah 15k saci or sas drives </s>
<s> they have a five year warantee </s>
<s> note there are very few high density 15k drives out their </s>
<s> like others i preferred western digital too </s>
<s> i feel that the pricing is reasonable for its stability reliability storage space and performance </s>
<s> moreover i am a avid user of wd products </s>
<s> hands down my answer is hitachi </s>
<s> i spend the bit higher amount but in all my computers and all the operatings systems the ones that live on are hitachi </s>
<s> wd and all the others die on me in around 1 year or just past it </s>
<s> in fact the last brand new computer i had built one year ago had a wd and in one day it gave me a failure notice </s>
<s> i had the builder purchase a hitachi and it is still going </s>
<s> recently i bought a new wd hard drive the one with the sas interface and it never disappointed </s>
<s> the wd s25 delivers ultra high performance with its 3 gb s and 6 gb s sas interfaces and a sustained sequential data rate of 128 mb sec </s>
<s> in addition to all the speed required to service any enterprise need the wd s25 also provides a 1 6 m hour mtbf rating </s>
<s> i must say i m impressed </s>
<s> i ve been building computers for myself and for friends for a dozen years now </s>
<s> i ve used practically every brand of hard drive out there </s>
<s> the only brand that has a 100 survival rating is samsung </s>
<s> i ve got several that are 11 years old and still going strong </s>
<s> maybe the new wd drives are better but my failure rate with them used to be quite high </s>
<s> nowadays samsung is the only brand i ll put in the computers i build </s>
<s> i have one of the new samsung 1 tb drives in my newest computer and it is awesome </s>
<s> in a few more that 20 years i have experienced two harddrive failures </s>
<s> both of these were western digital caviar drives </s>
<s> one drive was on a new computer still under warranty and was replaced by the manufacturer </s>
<s> the other was an older drive of unknown history salvaged from a discarded computer </s>
<s> that ran for several months after being installed in a pieced together computer before failing </s>
<s> i have heard similar storied from friends concerning wd drives and have not heard such stories concerning seagate drives </s>
<s> it is for these reasons that i prefer seagate if that option is available </s>
<s> i would have to agree with this statement </s>
<s> as long as you stick to the major brands it is a matter of luck of the pick from the assembly line </s>
<s> one extra step i sometimes do is google the model number to see if there is a larger than normal amount of complaints for a particular model so i don t get stuck with a device that has a design flaw </s>
<s> i have a pc 3 years old in september </s>
<s> acer that came with an hatachi 500gb i added the first week of ownership a western digital and 3 years and two months later the western digital failed </s>
<s> even for a back up drive with very little on it i was rather disappointed </s>
<s> it got pretty hot </s>
<s> ive unplugged it and once it cooled down it ran fine </s>
<s> i put a fan right in front of the hard drive in the case and still shut down every 3 days </s>
<s> so perhaps western digital sold me a fluke of a lemon </s>
<s> oh the warrenty expired on the 3 year mark </s>
<s> this p o s died exactly 2 months later </s>
<s> i ve had the best experience with seagate </s>
<s> i ve had several wds to fail but the seagates i ve worked with seem to hold up better </s>
