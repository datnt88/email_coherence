<s> right now i m looking at corsair ram 2gb latency 4 4 4 4 12 timings </s>
<s> however for a little bit more i could get mushkin extreme 2gb latency 3 3 3 3 10 ram </s>
<s> i know quite a bit about computers but ram would have to be my most lacking area </s>
<s> i know the mushkin ram has better timings and latency but i ve also heard a few bad things about mushkin albeit not much </s>
<s> i need opinions who s better </s>
<s> muskin or corsair </s>
<s> i know a few of my fellow tech heads will help me out on this one </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> these are both ddr2 667 ram sets </s>
<s> covers a lot of ground and benchmarks so you can test which one wins </s>
<s> however i ve found such testing to turn up less than 1 speed payback so i ve ceased overtesting this area in favor of price per gb and stability </s>

<s> here s a review of the mushkin extreme </s>
<s> personally i d go with corsair </s>
<s> i ve never had any problems with any corsair ram </s>
<s> i didn t even think about looking for ram reviews online </s>
