<s> i have a hp media center pc a1357c and i want to play some games like source </s>
<s> but my internal graphics card built in only goes up to 64mb as far as i can tell is there anything i can do to get better graphics without spending money kinda strapped for cash </s>
<s> if this is your computer then the specifications say that you have an open slot for inserting a pci express x16 not agp not pci video card </s>
<s> a good video card that has dedicated memory will not share slower system memory </s>
<s> shared memory includes integrated video and video carda that have hypermemory or turbocache </s>
<s> you can find pci express x16 video cards with dedicated memory for under 100 in the usa </s>
<s> you may need a psu upgrade to accommodate the more power hungry video cards </s>
<s> im looking at the nvidia geforce 6800 online at newegg for 100 good deal </s>
