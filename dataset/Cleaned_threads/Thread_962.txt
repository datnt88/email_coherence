<s> i need to run a computer about 500 feet from a wireless router the problem i am having is i am using a linksys wireless router and the signal is very weak at the ending computer i have tried range boosters with no help at all i do have a coax cable from a old network running from the building with the router in it to the building with the computer in it but cant find an adaptor to convert from coax to rj45 i also have thought about putting an exterior antenna up but have never played with them any ideas would be great thank you </s>
<s> may be the solution if you have straight line of sight layout </s>
<s> this is because the gain is at the cost of antenna being unidirectional so alignment and lack of obstruction is critical </s>
<s> i d look at e bay or a large network equipment dealer for dish with correct connector </s>
<s> you need to keep the connecting wires between wireless devices and antennas as short as pos incidentally </s>
<s> i m presuming it s 10 base2 and still in good shape </s>
<s> i believe this cable allows something like 185 meters but if it s old that might be a stretch </s>
<s> if that s the case one option might be to find an old nic with a coax jack </s>
<s> you d also need a t connector and a terminator of course </s>
<s> is that an option </s>
