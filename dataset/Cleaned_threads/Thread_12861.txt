<s> take a look at the second drive and see if the jumper on the back is set properly </s>
<s> if your motherboard does not support cable select you will need to set the hd with the os the 20 to master </s>
<s> the second drive the 40 will need to be set as slave </s>
<s> there should be a diagram on the top of the drive to show you how to set the jumpers and if not go to the manufacturers site and see if you can find that information </s>
<s> and if you are using a 40 wire cable the master needs to go on the middle connector </s>
<s> if you have an 80 wire cable the master boot drive should go on the end of the cable </s>
<s> you must set the jumpers one to slave and the other to master otherwise you will get nothing if you intend on keeping the 20 gig as your op drive leave it on master an set the 40 gig to slave ok of if you are setting the 40 gig as op drive do it the opesit way around u might have to reinstall your op sys </s>
