<s> i have decided i would like an external hd to back up mainly my music and digital pictures on my main drive </s>
<s> i really don t have anything else that important to back up or worry about </s>
<s> if i buy a new external is it as simple as plugging in the usb and begin transferring files to that drive </s>
<s> i just want it for storage only </s>
<s> also i have noted that it would be best to unplug this new drive when not in use so it does not get a bug or corrupted is that good advise </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> no write protect switch </s>
<s> any virulent virus pest trojan can delete such without anything stopping it </s>
<s> if a spare copy is all you want then this is fine but never call it a backup </s>
<s> your pictures are likely better off on cdr </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> when a usb storage device is present it is seen as yet another quot storage quot area or drive </s>
<s> while you can unplug plug on the fly its best to use the quot unmounting quot icon or feature of that product to handle that </s>
<s> yeah the ext </s>
<s> drive can be left unplugged before powering up system </s>
<s> in effect it s simple to use but don t let that fool ya treat it like any hd as if internal handle with care </s>
<s> now buy whatever ext </s>
<s> hd you like but please check whatever features seems to fit your likening </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> i have 2 120gb usb2 externals and a 120gb internal which i connect when i want to transfer large batches of files a few gb </s>
<s> the externals are normally disconnected </s>
<s> i connect only with the internet off and after i ve run trend internet security 2005 adaware spybot and giant ms s new acquisition all updated daily </s>
<s> i have 3 backups for all the personal stuff just to make sure i don t lose anything else big virus attack 2 years ago </s>
<s> after i connect the externals i do another set of scans and i have never had any pests resident in the externals or the sometimes connected internal either </s>
<s> looks like they prefer the straight line approach the c drive </s>
<s> normally i delete quarantine anywhere from 10 to 80 malwares per day depending on where i surf </s>
<s> i go where i damn well please but have to spend up to a couple of hours occasionally to clean the pc </s>
<s> either that or hide in the closet not my style </s>
<s> quot i delete quarantine anywhere from 10 to 80 malwares per day quot isn t it time to find out how such get on your system before one wipes you out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but i looked at the possiblity of tracing the different ones and got nowhere </s>
<s> i get cool web search constantly </s>
<s> search assistant took over my home page 3 or 4 times </s>
<s> trend gave 30 notices of dial tibs a and instructions for downloading the fix which wasn t an exe and wasn t recognized by the anti virus pattern file </s>
<s> i got many other repeats characterized as critical which were quarantined apparently before corrupting much </s>
<s> so far the worst symptom is erratic browsing and ie6 freeze followed by shut down and send error message like ms is going to do something heroic and cut off the monster s head </s>
<s> i refuse to be paranoid about surfing i go where i please and when i get a trojan regularly the last 3 urls get put in adaware i ve got a bunch in there </s>
<s> yeah the overhead is excessive but since i m retired i look at it as a game of sorts </s>
<s> i figure if none of the major players in anti virus can block this stuff but they seem to be able to contain the worst threats i ll see how it goes </s>
<s> since i do have several backups for everything i m concerned about and haven t lost any files i care about for a couple of years the worst case scenario is putting in a formatted c drive re installing xp pro transferring my backed up documents and settings favorites and desktop and reinstalling some of the apps that like to clutter up the registry but that i prefer not to do without </s>
<s> at least i m learning about the guts </s>
<s> if so you are letting the pests in </s>
<s> try firefox and see the pest count go down </s>
