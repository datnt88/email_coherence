<s> i have a ea6300 set up in my small duplex and it is crippling my download speeds </s>
<s> ran a program called network logger for 24 hours hard wired into modem had an average 88 03mbps download and 19 1 mbps </s>
<s> another 24 hours wired into router 84 11mbps down and 19mbps up </s>
<s> awesome </s>
<s> 24 hours on 2 4ghz network roughly 30 feet from router 9mbps down and 4 4mbps up </s>
<s> 24 hours on 5 ghz network same place in house 11mbps down and 997 kbps up i would trim this upload but its 24 hours with a 30 second refresh rate i have no cap on my usage and i also pay for 70 mbps </s>
<s> this wireless is killing my speed what gives </s>
<s> linksys says they want to replace the router but the bleep thing is brand new </s>
<s> i have the router set up exactly as linksys told me to prioritization is disabled </s>
<s> other information this is from inssider 5 ghz rssi 70 channel 36 40 wpa2 personal max transfer rate 450mbps there is no 0 other traffic on the lower 5 ghz freq 2 4 ghz rssi 52 channel 3 wpa2 personal max transfer rate 130mbps there is a bit of traffic on the 2 4ghz freq but channel 3 and 4 are not used except by me channel 7 11 are extremely clogged and channel 1 has about 5 networks on it </s>
<s> also to note on the 2 4 ghz channel my ps3 gets 2 4mbps down and 700kbps up in roughly the same place as the laptop </s>
<s> if anyone has any ideas on how to speed this up that would be quite useful </s>
<s> note up until about a week ago the only thing i knew about wifi was how to use the wizard when you get a new router </s>
<s> i am catching up but bear with me </s>
<s> those wifi speeds are under the best of conditions </s>
<s> i e </s>
<s> laboratory results </s>
<s> also if the wifi card in the laptops are well not current or from the same maker as the router speeds do fall </s>
<s> i ve only seen full speeds under ideal conditions and when i used a linksys router and matching linksys wifi cards </s>
<s> why not let linksys swap that router </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what wifi speeds would you be referring to </s>
<s> i think that a 80 decrease in download speeds should not be warranted given i ve seen wireless hit almost 30mbps on this laptop on other routers </s>
<s> i m not looking for 80 100 mbps but something over 9 or 10 would be nice </s>
<s> keep in mind this is an average over 24 hours </s>
<s> there were times when it was as low as 4 or 5 mbps </s>
<s> this is my only router at this moment and if i send it to linksys i go dark for awhile </s>
<s> this wouldn t be an issue but me and the wife use the internet for work </s>
<s> the cards and routers have to negotiate and if they are not matched up they can negotiate it wrong </s>
<s> there are consumers that don t want to get into the dirty bits but in short try setting it all as 802 11g and hope that helps </s>
<s> why would you go dark as you can run wired </s>
<s> something s not right here </s>
<s> also there s always virtual router to stand in </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i think that s sad </s>
<s> the wireless card seems to be fine but i understand what you mean about the cards not syncing </s>
<s> i ll try g thanks </s>
<s> yes i can leave a macbook down near the modem and internet share but wired is mostly out of the question unless i want to buy a few hundred feet of cat 5 or sit on my washer to chart </s>
<s> i don t know what you meant about something being wrong there but i meant what i said </s>
<s> you wrote you got it to work wired then wrote you would go dark </s>
<s> this didn t make any sense to me as it worked wired and we have virtual router for our windows pcs and apple has it s own way of doing that </s>
<s> we also have a dozen settings on wifi routers to try but i can t do that on a forum </s>
<s> i will offer the usual that works for most and not get into the other area that s for support folk to do </s>
<s> this is only a discussion forum and i ll share or discuss this but in no way am support </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yeah it works fine wired but check this out </s>
<s> my work space is not not next to my modem </s>
<s> so in order to do this i would have to haul all my stuff to my modem to work </s>
<s> this is not feasable therefore i require either wifi or 150 ft of cat 5 for my wife to trip over or complain about </s>
<s> as it turns out i don t have an extra computer to use as a router and buying one to do that seems counterintuitive </s>
<s> is that more clear </s>
<s> the cost of the ethernet cable is about the price of a cheap wifi router </s>
<s> in fact i was on travel and in a pinch needed a temporary router </s>
<s> i went to fry s and for under 20 bucks was done </s>
<s> a 150 foot ethernet cable could cost as much </s>
<s> gt but are you saying you have wifi out at 150 feet </s>
<s> i missed that detail and it can explain almost all of the troubles </s>
<s> you may have to deploy another system to move the wap closer to your pcs </s>
<s> bob </s>
