<s> hello i have a variety of lcd monitors that are not working </s>
<s> one is a samsung syncmaster 206bw 2x metro m 17sl and an older cicero lcd </s>
<s> the samsung i bought new and the other three were sitting in the back of the rv shop my girlfriend works in </s>
<s> the samsung was working fantastically until a power outage where it came back without the screen turning on and just the power button flashing a slow blue </s>
<s> it will not respond to vga or dvi signals from any computer </s>
<s> the metro monitors also have absolutely no screen video and the power lights come on vaguely then go off </s>
<s> the cicero has a very faint flash in the lcd panel that you can see when it is plugged in </s>
<s> it flashes faintly with the power button </s>
<s> my main question is what is wrong </s>
<s> i know that two capacitors on the samsung are bulged and vented and another two are bulged what is the likeliness of fixing this monitor by replacing the capacitors </s>
<s> i also noticed that upon opening one of the metro monitors that two of the five capacitors on the power board are also bulged </s>
<s> could this be the problem with this monitor as well </s>
<s> i have ordered capacitors as they are cheap and i am just wondering if this is the likely cause or if there is something else likely wrong to kill these lcd monitors </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> why didn t you fix those </s>
<s> the issue plague of bad caps was easy to find on google but you tell about ordering such but didn t share why you asked or posted here before you fixed that issue </s>
<s> also if the bad caps were not addressed early they can destroy the board or boards in the device they are in </s>
<s> bad caps see google are a plague in the industry but you know this if you did the research </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob the second part of your answer is exactly what i was asking for </s>
<s> the thing is i don t have a ton of room and i wanted to ask the cnet community if they had any other suggestions for me </s>
<s> i just found the bad caps yesterday so yes i am replacing them </s>
<s> i live out in the country in canada and it s not the easiest thing to just go and get something and try it </s>
<s> i have ordered all different sizes of caps that i need and i will be trying them when they get here likely up to two weeks i was simply wanting to know if this was something i should try yes i did spend a few hours googling this stuff or if my monitors were likely to just be toast </s>
<s> by all means replace the caps its a good idea if only to say you did it </s>
<s> of course because you lost power makes even more problematic as anything can be at fault </s>
<s> since you seemed to have stumbled on yet more bad monitors i ll guess that s a power problem in your area </s>
<s> so i strongly suggest you look into a very good surge protector ac line conditioner and even an ups if you care to </s>
<s> in other words protect your devices at best as you can afford </s>
<s> even the bad caps can be replaced with better models like ceramic or metallic military grade which are more durable or robust compared to the std </s>
<s> cap that looks like a small soda can rolled foil </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
