<s> since you emailed me with the model number of it i would think the refresh rate needs to be adjusted in display settings advanced and go to the monitor tab to see what it s defaulting to now and adjust it to what the specs are at the link i gave no higher than 60 hz from what i can see </s>

<s> it turns out that it was an internet accellerator program that caused it to happen and when she turned off disabled that program the monitor went back to normal </s>
<s> kudos to yewanchors for finding the solution i hadn t considered it to be anything other than a hardware issue </s>
