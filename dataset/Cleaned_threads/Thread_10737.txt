<s> i have a dell inspiron 620 last night a power surged messed up my computer </s>
<s> i didn t even realize this until i had sat down to a screen that was displaying quot windows is loading files quot and a full bar underneath just hanging there </s>
<s> i knew that this meant it had automatically done a startup repair but i wasn t sure why it was hanging </s>
<s> so i rebooted and changed the bios to run from the cd rom first </s>
<s> i put in a windows 7 cd to try and run startup repair from there and rebooted </s>
<s> again it just loaded the quot windows is loading files quot bar and hanged </s>
<s> at this point i decided to run an unbuntu cd to try and salvage what was on my hardrives before i did a clean wipe and reinstall of windows 7 it displayed the unbuntu splash page and then went blank </s>
<s> after this i noticed that there were sounds coming from inside my computer here s that uploaded in mp3 form to help give you an idea </s>
<s> after 23 skip to 58 what is this by user668315214 on soundcloud create record and share your sounds for free it makes these same sounds each time i tried to boot so i figured it was my hard drive causing this </s>
<s> to test that theory i removed my hardrives and used another one from a different computer that was made around the same time as my other hdds </s>
<s> still no proper boot and it made the exact same sounds </s>
<s> all i can think of it being is a mother board issue </s>
<s> what do you all think </s>
<s> sorry the correct link for the sound file is here </s>
<s> you can test the setup by disconnecting the hd entirely just leave in place </s>
<s> access the bios and be sure that the cd drive is the 1st boot device </s>
<s> i hope your ubuntu is a quot live cd version quot and then reboot to check status </s>
<s> if the ubuntu boots quickly or it does different than before report back </s>
<s> if the system boots then your hd is hosed </s>
<s> if it hangs again at same point then your mtrbd </s>
<s> could be at fault </s>
<s> of course any ram or video still is installed if you reduce or swap them out if status changes to narrow fault </s>
<s> often enough since you believe that a power surge caused the issue you maybe chasing problem after problem even if you think you ve resolved it </s>
<s> too often another problem crops up soon or it last at least 30 days or more then i ll consider it resolved </s>
<s> yeah it maybe time to replace pc if issues happen too soon or problems continue and </s>
<s> you can t trust the parts present in old pc until tested </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the sounds like the hd but it doesn t seem to continue on </s>
<s> if that s all then the hd is probably awaits some system error display to allow to continue </s>
<s> i suggest you wait and give it more time and see if any error message appears </s>
<s> wait about 10 15mins </s>
<s> the noise itself doesn t suggest a bad hd though unless this is constantly doing this </s>
