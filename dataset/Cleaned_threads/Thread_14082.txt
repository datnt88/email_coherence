<s> i have an external drive which i bought with a notebook 8 years ago connects via ieee 1394 and worked great for many years </s>
<s> last year i bought a new pc with xp </s>
<s> it had no ieee ports so i bought and installed a card </s>
<s> worked great for getting all the old stuff into the new pc </s>
<s> since the new pc has lots of space i put away the ext </s>
<s> drive for several months after the new machine was set up </s>

<s> drive again </s>
<s> also is there such a thing as a simple and reliable ieee 1394 usb adapter </s>
<s> no there is no such usb to ieee 1393 device </s>
<s> yes there is a call for such a thing but if you do your research you find out why there is none </s>
<s> for very little you can put the hard drive into some usb enclosure less than the cost of that firewire adapter </s>
