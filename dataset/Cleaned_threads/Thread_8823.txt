<s> first of all heres my computer </s>
<s> not sure how much info you can get from that but yea so right now im running a nvidia geforce4 mx 440 which from as much as i know sucks </s>
<s> i would very much like to upgrade but i dont think i know enough about it </s>
<s> according to the info above link its a agp 4x card so does that mean if i buy an 8x card it wont work on my pc </s>
<s> im not sure but i heard that the type of video card performance and such is limited by things like the processor speed and power supply </s>
<s> what kind of card is good for me to upgrade to without having to upgrade anything else </s>
<s> lastly what cards are good for me and within the 40 100 price range </s>
<s> i wish to stick with nvidia cause thats already what i have </s>
<s> and i might have to purchase this on the internet because its cheaper and all but im not sure </s>
<s> for one thing my parents arent fans of internet shopping </s>
<s> second if for some reason i get the card and it doesnt work im screwed </s>
<s> third there isnt anyone to ask for help when buying the card </s>
<s> are largely limited by three factors 1 what can the motherboard support in video options </s>
<s> 2 what do you want out of the upgrade </s>
<s> 3 how much can you spend </s>
<s> your link is busted so the mainboard info is not available </s>
<s> you have not said what you want to do and prices can be found here this is a safe and reliable site in my opinion </s>
<s> 40 70 </s>
<s> best card geforce 6600 71 after rebate ok card geforce 6200 oc 43 </s>
<s> yea well i was just informed that the recommended power supply should be 100w above the minimum required for the graphics card and mine is 295 4w and the 6600 min is 300w </s>
<s> so out the window goes that one </s>
