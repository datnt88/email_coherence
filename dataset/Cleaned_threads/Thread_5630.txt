<s> i took a glance at my old motherboard and i noticed that it has some ddr ram in it </s>
<s> the pink sticker this was a built computer so the various parts have pink stickers labeling them says it s pc266 32x64 256mb ddr ram </s>
<s> i was wondering could i possibly use this in conjunction with my pc3200 512mb ddr ram </s>
<s> i checked out the slot with the 256 stick and it d fit in there if i put it in but i don t know if it s compatible with the motherboard or maybe with the other ram </s>
<s> two other things about the 512 stick it s kingston and it s 184 pin the 256 probably is 184 too because it fits </s>
<s> my new motherboard is an asus k8n motherboard amd processor etc </s>
<s> more info needed please ask </s>
<s> thanks christopher </s>
<s> bus will now only run at the speed of the slower memory 133 266 rather than 200 400 </s>
<s> possibly the 255 stick could be overclocked but only by a skosh </s>
<s> just my two cents but i d ditch the 266 in favor of the 512 mb of pc 3200 </s>
<s> 512 mb is enough memory for almost any operation in xp </s>
<s> you ll get better overall performance </s>
<s> if your a gamer you can add more ram later </s>
<s> okay thank you both much i know that 512 s enough i was just wondering if it was worth it to use the extra stick of ram but i kind of figured that the overall performance would be better without the slower stick as stan said though i knew there d be no harm in asking </s>
<s> thanks again good day to you all </s>
