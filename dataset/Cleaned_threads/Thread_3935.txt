<s> i d like to get a nook hd love the screen resolution and i do a lot of reading </s>
<s> it seems to have less glare than the nexus 7 quot tablet </s>
<s> but i can t figure out how to get files from my camera onto the nook without doing it via computer </s>
<s> when i m on the road i don t want to take the computer i want to take the nook </s>
<s> the canon g1x camera uses a regular size sd card and the nook hd as a micro sd card reader </s>
<s> the camera does have a v out and hdmi which i could probably hook up to the nook via adapters but i don t know if the nook will be able to read the files or recognize them so i could save them onto the nook </s>
<s> the nook has a proprietary usb cable which i could hook into a card reader adapter but again i don t know if the software exists on the nook to recognize and manage the files </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i own a few eyefi cards and i have a few tablets but not the nook hd </s>
<s> just an older nook </s>
<s> my nook color as well as the nook hd have a microsd slot </s>
<s> so you can check out it appears you can see the pictures of standard jpeg </s>
<s> sorry but i don t have the nook hd so i can t do more here </s>
<s> gt parting comment </s>
<s> if support is that bad they can t answer your questions why are you considering their product </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> and put it in the camera and when your done you can pop the micro sd card out and insert it into the nook micros sd slot </s>
<s> yes you can get micro sd adapters i have a couple of them i believe i purchased them at fry s several years ago </s>
