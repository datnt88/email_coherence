<s> i have an airlink wireless g router and am having trouble getting a steady connection on it </s>
<s> most of the times it works but a couple of times a day it seems to die for a few minutes </s>
<s> turning wep off helped but didn t fix the problem entirely </s>
<s> i forgot to say that sometimes i can get one website and not another </s>
<s> just a couple of minutes ago i could access wikipedia but not cnet or my school s website byu edu </s>
<s> any ideas </s>

<s> rick </s>
<s> i am not trying to find information on how to work a router in general </s>
<s> i know typical installations </s>
<s> and it isn t some vista bug that is causing problems because i have two xp machines and one mac that are experiencing the same problem </s>
<s> i just wanted to know if anybody else is having problems with this brand </s>
<s> do you have experience with this brand </s>
<s> 1 i re read your post and couldn t tell if you followed the suggestions in our forum sticky </s>

<s> quot but a couple of times a day it seems to die for a few minutes quot is typical of when you or your neighbor has those 2 4ghz cordless phones </s>
<s> there s no fix for this if you can t banish them except to get wired </s>

<s> airlink technology and mfg is no better or worse than other brands </s>
<s> they package wifi chipsets rf just like the others do </s>
<s> their firmware lack fancy features available in the linksys netgear dlink and buffalo brands but it works reliably </s>
<s> your problem may be in setup as other replies suggest </s>
<s> i will only add that if your ap router is not mimo you can expect poorer connections </s>
<s> for the low price nowadays always get a mimo g or n device </s>
<s> the client need not be mimo </s>
<s> i hadn t thought of wireless phones </s>
<s> i will check this out see if one of my neighbors has one </s>
<s> thank you for your post </s>
<s> i will try some different settings to get it to work better </s>
<s> i wired a computer into the router and still have issues </s>
<s> i will probably just reset the router every week </s>
<s> that seems to work for a while </s>
<s> and it s my laptop then i know the router has issues </s>
<s> or someone is running p2p applications </s>
<s> some routers have issues with p2p but do check for their latest firmware and tell us if you are running p2p </s>
