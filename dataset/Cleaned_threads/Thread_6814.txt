<s> my linksys 802 11b router and four computers with various usb adapters worked fine for months </s>
<s> all of a sudden two computers failed to connect </s>
<s> they saw a good signal from the router but would not receive packets </s>
<s> finally a nice lady at linksys tech help told me how to enter the ip manually </s>
<s> why would xp s quot obtain ip address automatically quot function suddenly fail </s>
<s> the most common reason i m running into is this </s>
<s> the owner accepted a driver update from microsoft s windows update </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that makes sense the computers that work okay have never asked for ms driver updates </s>
