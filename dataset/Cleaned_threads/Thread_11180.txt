<s> i was working on a friend s presario x6000 a big laptop with a big graphics problem nothing could be read on the screen </s>
<s> after re installing xp pro using the compaq disk then use a second disk to install several more drivers including ati m22 24 video </s>
<s> everything worked ok until the driver is installed then the screen becomes horribly fuzzy can t think of a better description and you can barely read anything as it was before </s>
<s> sometimes booting stops at a black screen </s>
<s> i ve loaded drivers from ms automatic update from ati and from hp with their on line help but everytime any graphics video driver is loaded disaster hits </s>
<s> i ve even done the whole routine with a different hard drive with the same result </s>
<s> the only remedy is to restore from safe mode or reinstall the os again </s>
<s> without the ati graphics it s obviously sluggish but it works </s>
<s> i think there is a problem with the graphics part of the motherboard because it s relatively ok before a driver quot activates quot it </s>
<s> this wouldn t be such a big deal on a desktop just stick a new card in it </s>
<s> so any idea why installing a graphics driver kills it </s>
<s> i think it s a hardware flaw </s>
<s> swap in a new motherboard and re test </s>
<s> be sure the bios is defaults in case there is some setting that breaks the graphics </s>
<s> too bad i don t have another motherboard </s>
<s> a new mb from hp is like 799 or one from ebay for maybe 300 plus the time and hassle to change it not my favorite chore </s>
<s> i don t think the owner is willing to spend that much at this point but if a new mb was the only way then we d be able to make a decision on it </s>
<s> but i can t buy one just to try it </s>
<s> i asked the question hoping somebody had a similar experience or as quot is there any possible solution that i m not aware of quot short of a new mb </s>
<s> i have a feeling i may be owning this laptop if it comes cheaply enough </s>
<s> or rather ubuntu see google </s>
<s> i often test such machines with a linux cd to see if the graphics choke under linux </s>
<s> if it fails in linux it surely is a machine with issues </s>
<s> gt about the board swap </s>
<s> this is where hp and such has it all over the little guy </s>
<s> they have the boards and can do the test call in the engineers and more </s>
<s> but your description is just like what i ve seen with failed video ram </s>
<s> however since we can t replace that with ease or safely then the board swap is the right way </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i gave the computer back to the owner with the warning to not let it install a video driver </s>
<s> i ll wait see what happens </s>
<s> i do have a ubuntu cd if i get it back </s>
<s> like most others i m much more conservative when working on other people s computers but if it were mine let it rip </s>
<s> that s how i learn </s>
