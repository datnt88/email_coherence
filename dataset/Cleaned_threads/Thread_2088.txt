<s> i own an external hard drive its a toshiba </s>
<s> i don t remember the exact model but its the one that has a solid background and 5 two toned quot curves quot on the top of the drive </s>
<s> here anyway this is a two part question for all you pro s out there </s>
<s> first off ive had this for quite awhile and i have well my entire life on it </s>
<s> i know </s>
<s> its not the best thing in the world to depend on something that could potentially break but thus far it has been fine </s>
<s> recently however it stopped getting quot read quot on my laptop </s>
<s> the little notification still comes up that i quot attached quot something to the usb </s>
<s> and i can still see and use what s on the external but only if i directly go to start computer e drive </s>
<s> i used to be able to listen to my music on wmp when my settings were attached to my e my music drive </s>
<s> not anymore </s>
<s> it wont even recognize it </s>
<s> i had attached some program icon short cuts to my taskbar and even those are quot invalid quot </s>
<s> i click on them and it tells me that the disk cannot open because its write protected </s>
<s> no its not </s>
<s> unless somehow it went protected </s>
<s> how do i check for this and has anyone else had anything like this happen </s>
<s> how do i fix it </s>
<s> can i fix it </s>
<s> second part of the question if i bought a new external hard drive can i um transfer everything from the old external to the new one </s>
<s> is it a pain in the butt </s>
<s> i cant see how i would go about this but i am sure there is some way around it </s>
<s> hopefully you lovely ladies and gents can help me out because as you can imagine this is starting to worry me </s>
<s> all my business stuff is on that drive so if it breaks gulp </s>
<s> btw i just saw the other post on being able to transfer from and to a new and old drive </s>
<s> so dont answer that </s>
<s> but it did bring up another thought for the past month or so every time i even remotely bump my external the quot ding quot noise happens and the notification pops up that the drive has been re attached or whatever it says </s>
<s> i wonder if all these problems are simply being caused by the wire </s>
<s> that would be crazy </s>
<s> can i buy just the wire </s>
<s> shop for a new cable </s>
<s> don t bump it and get your files safe again </s>
<s> okay does anyone know the name of the cable or any links to the cable or anything like that </s>
<s> mine is super short </s>
<s> it looks like this one but its not 4 foot </s>
<s> is it essential to buy toshiba </s>
<s> but if this hdd is usb powered i carry one like this gt bob </s>
