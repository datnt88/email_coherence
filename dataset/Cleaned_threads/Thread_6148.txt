<s> i have a seagate barracuda 7200 rpm sata 200 gb hard disk which i recently converted into a portable one by using one of those usb aluminum casings </s>
<s> everything was working fine until i copied some files from my friends computer when a virus also lodged itself on my harddisk </s>
<s> now whenever i connected my harddisk to my laptop the data was accessible but it always tried to autorun a program but thankfully my antivirus bitdefender v10 always stopped it from doing so </s>
<s> one day i did a virus check on the harddisk using the same antivirus it found a virus in one of the files but could not repair it so i deleted the file </s>
<s> from that day on i am not able to access any data on my harddisk </s>
<s> whenever i connect it to my laptop the harddisk is detected and i know this by 1 the eject icon in the status bar 2 it lists the harddisk in the device manager 3 it also shows the harddisk on the bios settings menu at startup </s>
<s> but the hard disk is not displayed in the explorer neither in dos </s>
<s> there is an occasional blip blip sound that comes from the harddisk and that s it </s>
<s> and there are two continuous blips at a time </s>
<s> also this harddisk does not have any os on it and it has four equal partitions </s>
<s> please help me out preferably without formatting the harddisk </s>
<s> and i didn t drop the hdd at any point of time however i might have dropped the adapter at some point of time but still the lights on the adapter and the casing light up whenever i plug it in </s>
<s> and connect direct to a desktop pc you could also run the seagate diagnostics too </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> it s now suspect </s>
<s> try another or go direct connect in some desktop </s>
<s> as to the autorun you could have fixed that fast by deleting the autorun inf file in the root of the drive bob </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i have tried it connecting directly to another computer but still there is no response </s>
<s> in case if you want to know the sound that comes from the harddisk it is at </s>
