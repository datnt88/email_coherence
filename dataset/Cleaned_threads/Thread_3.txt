<s> i recently had to send my laptop into dell for repairs </s>
<s> well dell decided that my laptop was damaged beyond repair and sent me a completely different one along with the harddrive from my old laptop </s>
<s> i ve tried putting the old harddrive into the new laptop but i just keep getting error messages </s>
<s> can anyone tell me if it is possible to retrieve my files from the old harddrive and if so how </s>
<s> also please don t refer me to dell </s>
<s> they have already made it clear that it s my problem not theirs </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> get an external usb 2 case for the hard drive </s>
<s> here wayne ibm freak 6 click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about analog and digital data internet connections spyware removal and download free software </s>
<s> my mini schnauzer is smarter than your honor student </s>
<s> google for this product adapter called ada 2020 </s>
<s> found at and others </s>
<s> used for usb 2 0 to sata ide connections </s>
<s> this adapter will allow you to access the old laptop drive and many others should the need arise </s>
<s> pricing is decent and is far more flexible than a simple usb case though that will work </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> seems pretty nice to me obviously you ve had some grief along the way but i d definitely agree if dell gave you a new laptop they ve delivered completely on any concept of warranty </s>
<s> i think the suggestions above are good but if the reason the laptop went for repairs was a faulty hard drive you may need more heroic measures for data recovery which are never described as inexpensive </s>
<s> i m inferring there s useful data that aren t backed up </s>
<s> if it s just your applications and configuration you want restored you ll be quicker and better to start from scratch </s>
<s> as outlined in the thread above i have hung the old hard drive in an enclosure on a usb port and can see the folders just fine but when i try to open the folders i need my documents application data it gives me a permissions error </s>
<s> how do i get past it </s>
<s> i have the username and password the files were created under but don t know where to enter them </s>
<s> google these xp take ownership vista take ownership </s>
