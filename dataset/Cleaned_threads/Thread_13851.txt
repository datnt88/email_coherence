<s> i have been noticing that whenever i disconnect from my wpa wireless network my usb ports don t work </s>
<s> whenever i plug in my flash drives my laptop is not able to see them </s>
<s> then when i shut down my laptop just hangs </s>
<s> i use a dell e1505 with windows xp media center </s>
<s> if the flash drive was already connected before i disconnect i can still read them but i cannot safely remove it </s>
<s> i ve encountered such things but only when the owner installed the os </s>
<s> many forget to use dell s other cds with drivers and more </s>
