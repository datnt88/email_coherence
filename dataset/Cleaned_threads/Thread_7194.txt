<s> i recently bought a used computer at a yard sale </s>
<s> it came with a hard drive by quot conner technology quot </s>
<s> the drive has problems so i was going to look at their website to see the conditions of any warranties </s>
<s> the drive says that the website is but as you can see it s just an advertisement site </s>
<s> has another company acquired conner or did they just go out of business </s>
<s> from memory well over 10 years ago </s>
<s> and from memory conner was picked up by seagate </s>
<s> but i could be wrong </s>
<s> unless you need data off the drive let s be honest here and write that such drives are fine door stops </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if it s important here are some specs model ct210 size 10 2 gb interface e ide power 5 12 v 750 250 ma </s>
<s> 36 inches wide </s>
<s> 68 inches high 1 3 4 thick and wieghed about 50 pounds </s>
<s> your drive should work just fine for it s new purpose </s>
<s> read this is a very old drive no warranty and is a great device to look at </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> did not play well with any other mfr s drives </s>
<s> this is a computer with a 633 mhz cpu 256 mb ram a 4x cd rw drive and a 14x cd rom </s>
<s> i m seriously considering scrapping this computer and trying to salvage anything useful not much </s>
<s> but i actually didn t buy it it was given to me for free and i know why </s>
<s> i can however use the hard drive which will be the most useful part of the whole computer </s>
<s> as for the conner drive here s my suggestions </s>
<s> 1 disassemble it hds are really cool devices their innards make really interesting paperweights conversation pieces </s>
<s> 2 get sunday s circulars and find a nice new hd for your main pc </s>
<s> 60 should get you 160gb or more </s>
<s> 3 put the old drive from your main pc in your hobby pc and start tinkering with stuff you d never do with your main pc </s>
<s> install linux </s>
<s> make a backup device </s>
<s> make a firewall </s>
<s> geek out </s>
