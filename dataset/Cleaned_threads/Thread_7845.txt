<s> i d like to transfer all my old vcr tapes and 8mm tapes to dvd </s>
<s> i m looking to buy a new computer that can handle all that video editing can do </s>
<s> i m looking at an hp pavilion a6750y </s>
<s> phenom 2 3gz quad core processer 8gb od ram 750 gb hard drive </s>
<s> i ll be uploading with a pinnacle dazzle recorder thru a usb </s>
<s> will this machine let me get the job done </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> trying to stay under 1000 00 thanks bobmj14120 </s>
<s> and after a few tapes i declared quot this is nuts quot i went and bought a simple 55 buck dvd recorder connected it to my vcr popped in the blank dvd r a tape pressed play then record on the respective boxes and came back in 2 hours to retrieve the finished dvd </s>
<s> feel free to repeat the lesson i learned </s>

<s> sounds like youre adding another step since youd then have to copy the dvds to your hard drive to edit them vs capturing straight to the computer </s>
<s> i have a quad core and dazzle as well and can copy from a camcorder and play a game at the same time </s>
<s> only those that have done such things will understand i fear </s>
<s> when you use the computer as the capture you can count on about 4 hours of computer work for each hour of dvd video </s>
<s> i m sharing my lesson learned and a cheap fast economical solution </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> dazzle records to mpeg2 which is the dvd format </s>
<s> you can either burn to dvd from the capture or edit it </s>
<s> if you want to reply to the original poster do that </s>
<s> but i ve btdt and will share it s too much work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> buy a rig with a phenom ii or core i7 depending on your video editing software you might be able to offload work to the graphics card if your software does that it would be a good investment to buy a good graphics card like a radeon hd 48x0 or geforce gtx 2xx </s>
