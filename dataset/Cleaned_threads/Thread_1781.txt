<s> i stupidly formatted the wrong hard drive when there are two external hard drives connected on my computer </s>
<s> it is a wd external hard drive </s>
<s> i heard about the data recovery software which could help restore the saved data back from a formatted drive </s>
<s> but i am afraid the program may make things worse </s>
<s> do i have to use a data recovery program to get back my videos </s>
<s> is there any one that could give me some suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you don t have to use a data recovery program that option is entirely yours to make </s>
<s> but if you want this data back you either try those or send the drive to some data recovery business </s>
<s> that 2nd option will cost a lot </s>
<s> have a look at the software suggested in lost and found </s>
<s> or the storage forum sticky </s>
<s> there are some good suggestions there but which ones work best if at all can only be found by trying </s>
<s> remember you are unlikely to recover all your lost files </s>
<s> i assume you have no backups </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> it s at the top of the forum and progresses from free to try before buy to data recovery houses </s>
<s> remember to never write to said drive </s>
<s> we only do that after we recovered copied out the lost files </s>
<s> in the future be sure of your backup systems so you won t repeat this problem </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> after accidentally deleting the needed data one could use a data recovery programs or ask for a data recovery service from the expert and data recovery company </s>
<s> but the latter choice always needs much money </s>
<s> so if you have no much money for it you could firstly try some drive data recovery freeware </s>
<s> in fact as i know there are many drive data recovery freeware that could work much efficiently than some paid ones such as recuva testdisk and icare data recovery free etc </s>
<s> therefore do not save anything new on this formatted drive in case of data loss and select a proper data recovery program to take chances </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> thank you so much for your explanation of formatted drive data recovery </s>
<s> after mistakenly formatting this hard drive i am really worried that i could make thing worse </s>
<s> but fortunately after reading your answer i have tried your mentioned data recovery freeware and restore back all my wanted files back </s>
<s> thank you thank you thank you for your help </s>
<s> if you do not want to make things worse when you use the program to recover formatted files from hard drive there are a few precautions to keep in mind first before you recover your data do not save any new files onto the formatted hard drive </s>
<s> second do not install the recovery software onto the formatted drive install it on a different disk drive or to a separate pc </s>
<s> third if you are afraid of damage to the formatted drive during recovery process you can create a disk image of the drive to pull the data from rather than directly from the disk some of the recovery software includes disk imaging function </s>
<s> you can try quot remo recover tool quot to recover your video from a formatted hard drive </s>
<s> you can try the free softwares but i suggest you not to do this as these tools may corrupt your file even further </s>
<s> the tool which i suggested here is paid software you can try demo version of this tool through whichs you can test its proficiency </s>
