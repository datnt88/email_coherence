<s> hi i m just planning on buying a computer and i wonder if a sound card really makes any difference </s>
<s> i would gladly accept recommendations about different sound cards which have got good test results and are worth the money </s>
<s> listening to music and sound with movies the sound built in motherboards is quite good enough </s>
<s> but maybe you ve got some special requirements you don t mention </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> unless you re an audiophile or require a specific audio need what comes with a typical system now will do fine </s>
<s> of course you can usually upgrade after the purchase later </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the one lackluster area of onboard i ve found is the occasional lack of stereo inputs </s>
<s> the next is the analog inputs tend to be noisy compared to any creative labs card made in the past decade </s>
<s> beyond that i d try the onboard sound first </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if you re thinking of a ready made computer assembled in a factory ala hp or dell it s gonna have audio on the motherboard and is going to be quite good sounding surround sound capable and all that jazz </s>
<s> i d encourage you to try the built in before investing in an add on </s>
