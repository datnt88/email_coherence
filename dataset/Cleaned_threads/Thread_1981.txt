<s> i am having problems with a keyboard on a pc running windows xp </s>
<s> when i press backspace it opens internet explorer </s>
<s> i have looked everwhere and can not find a solution to this </s>
<s> any help would be great </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> start settings control panel keyboard make sure it is set to us default look at the keyboard mappings character settings etc </s>
<s> it got changed somehow possibly malware </s>
<s> when a keyboard starts messing up like you describe the first things to do are to unplug and replug the keyboard to see if that fixes it </s>
<s> next is to reboot third is to test another keyboard </s>
