<s> hi my printer was connected to my home wireless network just fine until recently </s>
<s> i decided to change my network ssid and network key to something more easily remembered and now my printer will not connect to the network </s>
<s> i keep getting error ts 05 that the ssid and or password are not matching </s>
<s> my old network was using a 64 bit hex key which had a 10 digit password in hex </s>
<s> when i first changed it i went to ascii 64 bit which used a 5 digit password </s>
<s> when that did not work i tried ascii 128 bit with a 13 digit password but again that did not work </s>
<s> then i went back to hex 64 bit with a 10 digit password but that is still not working </s>
<s> the other change i made as to change the ssid from some generic 5 digit code lzst3 to a new one mulnofamily </s>
<s> all of my other devices have been able to connect to each of the above network changes just fine </s>
<s> this is multiple laptops ipad and android tablets etc </s>
<s> none of those have any issue with any of the changes i have made </s>
<s> only the brother printer is not talking any longer </s>
<s> any help on this </s>
<s> i should add although i do not think it matters my computer is a windows vista computer </s>
<s> but again i am trying to connect this wireless directly like it was before </s>
<s> it s another reason i move to wpa2 </s>
<s> ok i ended up resetting the modem back to factory settings which put back the ssid and password </s>
<s> that allowed it to work again </s>
<s> i then changed just the password and the printer was still able to reconnect </s>
<s> so i am not sure if it did not like the ssid i was trying to use or if something else happened but i can live with the weird ssid but a password that works for me </s>
<s> thanks everyone </s>
