<s> the internal cd rw dvd rom drive crx810e in my older 4 years old sony viao notebook pcg grx550 recently started acting up </s>
<s> if i insert any kind of cd or dvd into the drive it thinks it is an audio cd </s>
<s> if i try to play the cd even audio cds or dvd the drive spins for a while and then fails to read anything </s>
<s> i looked under the properties for the drive and everything seems to be okay </s>
<s> i also ran diagnostics and it failed to find anything wrong with the drive </s>
<s> has anyone seen this kind of problems before </s>
<s> any comments suggestions solutions would be appreciated </s>
<s> they run under 100 bucks if you change it yourself </s>

<s> bob thanks again for your help </s>
<s> i thought i might have to buy a new drive </s>
<s> any ideas where i could buy a new drive that i could install myself </s>
<s> sony is asking for 350 </s>
<s> btw i exchanged my external drx 710ul dvd burner another posting you had helped me with for another one and it works like a charm </s>
<s> that s 1 2 the price of some new laptops </s>
<s> nero infotool noted at and belarc advisor may dig out what drive that is so we can see if we can find a better deal </s>

<s> try bob </s>
<s> hey dgogoi i have the exact same problem with my sony viao now 2 years old that you did </s>
<s> did you end up getting a new dvd rom if so which one and did it work out all right </s>
<s> i m also curious if you had any trouble switching them out </s>
<s> i took a look at mine and it didn t look like the removal installation was anywhere near as straight forward as with most laptops </s>
<s> thanks steve </s>
<s> i have the same cd r w dvd combo drive and have had a hell of a time with it </s>
<s> from incorrect copying of my files to not alowing me to r w my r w disk to not recognizing my r and r w disk not to mention the failure to play all regions formated dvds </s>
<s> i am seriously considering getting an external replacement drive and uninstalling this god damned combo drive and throwing it in the garbage heap of all the other poorly designed drives and p c </s>
<s> devices </s>
<s> combo drives at this point in time are imperfect at best useless at worst </s>
<s> the problem is laptops and notebooks rarely can handle more then one cd rom dvd rom drives so unless you dare try to find a non combo drive that will be compatiable with your laptop and not require a certification to install an external drive s are your best bet </s>
<s> windows default drivers are often troblesome and very often not compatiable with your devices </s>
<s> sometimes your device s will work but not to their full potential because of imperfectly matched and or outdated drivers such as the cd part of your drive working but not the cd r and cd rw part </s>
<s> uninstall your combo drive and get an external dvd r w drive if money is an issue try e bay or if you prefer new comp usa is a good choice </s>
<s> good luck and damn sony and their expensive and buggy computers and devices </s>
