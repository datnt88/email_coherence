<s> i want a printer for low usage inkjet or cheap color laser 400 low usage about 10 pages a month moderate quality for childrens color pictures and quick printing photos not high quality photos i do those thru a service cost of supplies lt 150 per year my problem has been that inkjet cartridges seem to dry out in 1 or 2 months whether they are used or not </s>
<s> this leads to a yearly cost of 300 much too high </s>
<s> the cost per page in reviews never seem to consider this issue will a color laser cartidge last more than a year </s>
<s> are there inkjets that will last 3 months </s>
<s> just forget about inkjets in general at the rate you print </s>
<s> you can then look at laser printers </s>
<s> but because you want cheap then cheap is it </s>
<s> look no further than the price because many offer decent output but again your results are what you pay for </s>
<s> most seek fantastic color but well within acceptable results for many users </s>
<s> just about all brands have a bottom end model that fit under 300 or less </s>
<s> look for sales or online offerings than meet your needs </s>
<s> the starter toner cart may last a yr but it will deplete sooner only because its a small amount compared to replacement and cost should fit your wallet </s>
<s> if you like you may want to try kinko s or similar a office copy center that with your file or original form will reproduce at roughly 10 15cent per page </s>
<s> use this when in a pinch </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> for such purposes and in fact higher volume in black text i m happy with a cheap canon printer especially the older types for which you can buy compatible cartridges and replace the printhead yourself i had to do that once </s>
<s> cartridges and printheads come separately </s>
<s> in the unlikely case the printhead is clogged won t happen if you print each week use the original cartridge and leave the printer connected to the mains you can find non canon cleaning cartridges </s>
<s> i had to use one of those recently after using a refilled cartridge not sure that was the cause however </s>
<s> all other cartridges original or compatible alike i could use till they were totally empty </s>
<s> i also like the driver support for concept quality and printing half size 2 pages on one sheet for text </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i have four printers of varying price and the best is the lowest cost </s>
<s> paid 49 for an epson c62 the cartridges 2 are sold on line for 4 25 and the printing quality is very good </s>
<s> i have all price ranges of printers and mainly print photos </s>
