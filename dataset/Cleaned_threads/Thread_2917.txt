<s> i know the steps of trfansfering vhs tapes to my computer </s>
<s> however there are a few individuals in my life that don t have a clue or really want to get that involved and need something simplier </s>
<s> i know there was a device a few years ago that allowed someone to copy a vhs tape to dvd that was not a regular dvd vhs recorder </s>
<s> this was portable and not much bigger than the actual vhs cassette </s>
<s> has anyone heard of this or have info on it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> or maybe i don t understand the whole story </s>
<s> just another dvd recorder in the small form factor </s>
<s> big claims about ease of use so i bet many paid dearly for the lesson </s>
<s> covers the 5 most common methods </s>
<s> thanks for the article i guess the best option might be getting them an external dvd burner </s>
<s> but now my question would be what type of file would be created doing this </s>
<s> mpeg 4 </s>
<s> the easiest ones create quot bog standard video dvds quot which are mostly mpeg 2 anything else would create compatibility headaches </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> pinnacle makes a device for that purpose it is called a quot dazzle quot look into that </s>
<s> this is for an end user that really didn t want to get a pc involved in doing transfers </s>
<s> originally i was asking about something portable that could do this function i saw it on a shopping channel a few years ago but i couldn t find it so i guess i will either have to talk them into dazzle or tell them to forget it </s>
<s> there are devices that can do that </s>
<s> see here for one that is fairly modern here is a cnet article but they are all old devices now of course one could always pay someone else to do the conversions </s>
<s> depending on where you live the local drug store may provide that service on a quot per tape quot basis </s>
<s> and if you are not allergic to using ebay you might find a device that someone bought to do vhs tapes and got theirs all done and now offer the device for sale </s>
<s> i actually found what i m looking for i think on ebay it s an older version of a sony product they have more up to date versions available but this one will work for now please wait image not available sony dvdirect vrd mc5 </s>
<s> the description you originally stated </s>
<s> good luck </s>
