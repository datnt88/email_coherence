<s> i am planning on buying a new desktop with the following amd 64 3400 1 gb memory 200 gb hard light scribe dvd r rw is there any major difference between the compaq sr1010z and the hp a850e </s>
<s> if so what might they be </s>
<s> when both systems have virtually the same stuff the compaq is over 100 dollars cheaper </s>
<s> does the hp label on the tower really cost this much or is the hp built better </s>
<s> hp actually owns compaq </s>
<s> so basically other than the design they will be the exact same machines </s>
<s> you didn t indicate where you were looking at the specifications </s>
<s> looking at hp and compaq official sites course we know hp purchased compaq some time ago the the compaq sr1010z only goes as high as amd64 3300 whereas the hp a850e has the amd 64 3400 and can be configured higher so that is one part of the difference </s>
<s> overall using your selected components i figure about 80 difference which is worth getting the hp over the compaq </s>
<s> for compaq sr1010z click then click customize for hp a850e click then click customize </s>
<s> i am looking at hp site and thanks for you comments </s>
<s> what do you mean by configured higher </s>
<s> also on it the 3300 and 3400 both operate at 2 4ghz </s>
<s> in doing more research the 3300 is not found on amd website were the 3400 is </s>
<s> so might they be the same processor or is there a difference </s>
<s> re quot what do you mean by configured higher quot the hp a850e can be configered to a athlon 64 3700 whereas the compaq sr 1010z only goes as high as athlon 64 3300 note the chart here at amd yes amd does not list the 3300 so it is a unlisted special built with a 512kb l2 cache a different processor from the 3400 and apparently less expensive </s>
<s> i would go for the athlon 64 3400 with 1mb of l2 cache with the hp a850e as apparently that series stays away from the not amd recognized 3300 model </s>
<s> ps also in comparison the hp would reduce cost even less if you got the monitor </s>
<s> my dad has this one for the past 2 weeks a new purchase and so far so good </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> a ok he has the athlon 64 3400 with winxp media center card readers firewire dvd cd burners 2nd cd rom drive giant hard drive and an agp video card that will play games </s>
<s> on the athlon 64 3300 the best i can find is 256kb l2 cache </s>
<s> on the athlon 64 3400 according to charts with tom s hardware the l2 cache can be 512kb with the newcastle core or 1024kb cache with the clawhammer core </s>
<s> exactly john </s>
<s> i have posted on this before </s>
<s> both the athlon 64 3300 and 3100 are offered by various manufactures </s>
<s> the reduced l2 cache appears to be being offered to mass manufacturers to enable them to use the athlon 64 trademark at a reduced price </s>
<s> apart from the 64 bit capabilities i am convinced these 256 l2 cache variants offer little over the sempron 3100 which has 1600 fsb and 256 l2 cache </s>
<s> it s a shame amd allows and promotes the athlon 64 name for an inferior product i am currently shopping for a new rig and continually run into this misrepresentation of an otherwise fine product </s>
<s> on the issues of power supplies all i ve seen on these forums for months now was to get a system with a power supply 400w or more now i see this system with the athlon 64 has a 250w and suppose to be good also see many ads </s>
<s> on net with systems only going as high as 300w what gives do newer systems now require less power </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> depends but new systems do not require less power </s>
<s> all factory type computers like dell gateway hp compaq sony emachine etc will install the lowest usually the cheapest power supply that will adequately support all the components that come with their particular model and priced computer </s>
<s> like dell would put a very low power supply in their 2400 3000 models and a much higher power supply in their xps mode </s>
<s> what usually happens is that after a particular low priced computer is purchased joe blow decides to up the video graphic add a dvd or cdr bigger hard drive or something that puts a strain on the power supply which can cause freeze ups other problems even like one of mine smoke coming out of the power supply </s>
<s> builders people buying components and putting them together or having some company configure their pc to build are always encouraged to put in at least a 350 to 500 watt power supply </s>
<s> the thing is buy a higher priced factory computer or consider changing out your power supply when you start adding stuff that may be more powerful than the original equipment </s>
<s> jr </s>
<s> see a few local shops this area building very good systems but with 300w power supplies i sort of figured they were they were getting cheap ps s and pushing them to their limits and anyone needing just a small upgrade on just about anything would need to change ps this i would call ripping off people who dont really know what they are buying </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well not necessarily </s>
<s> there are a lot of good 300 watt power systems that are not your cheap variety and work well in desktops </s>
<s> there are also some 300 400 450 500 watt power systems that don t produce what they advertise </s>
<s> some 500w can be purchased for as low as 18 hmmmm moderator robert proffitt has discussed power supplies many times in this forum and others </s>
<s> just do a cnet advanced forum search on power supply with his name </s>
<s> tom s hardware has published many articles </s>
<s> check the last one listed here for the latest </s>
