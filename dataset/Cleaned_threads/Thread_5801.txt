<s> just installed a pci based video card in my older desktop so that i can run dual monitors one s on a serial port the other is dvi </s>
<s> i m wondering if there is anyway to also use the oem stock video chipset to run a third monitor at the same time on the original serial port </s>
<s> we re using windows 7 here if that helps </s>
<s> some of them will support two devices </s>
<s> being that there are two video cards installed perhaps one of them is capable of running two </s>
<s> what are the make and model numbers of the installed cards </s>
<s> most unlikely </s>
<s> you want dual display then get a video card that supports it </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> that must be a typo or misunderstanding </s>
<s> as to the onboard graphics since some machines disable onboard video when a card is installed you can t tell if you can use that until you try it </s>
