<s> i am haivng a problem with my dvd rw burner </s>
<s> it is rosewell with a firmwire of a060 wrotes at 48x ect </s>
<s> my system is a general off the shelf systme form compusa running windows xp using an amd athalon 2600 w 512 meg of ram and an ati x800 pro video card but here is my problem </s>
<s> this is my first quot install it yourself quot job and i cannot find the drivers for this thing </s>
<s> when ever i pop in a dvd it suddenly thinks it is a cd drive not a dvd drive </s>
<s> i have the correct firmwire as far as i know but am not sure aobut the drivers or why the drive is having self esteem problems when i give it a dvd to read </s>
<s> it will read audio cds fine and data cds are slower than in my cd combo drive </s>
<s> anyone have a solution to my dvd drive woes </s>
<s> the dvd functions are not native to all windows versions </s>
<s> you only get dvd playback when you run dvd player software and recording when you run recording software </s>
<s> the id of cd dvd and such is a cosmetic issue that microsoft doesn t seem to have fixed yet </s>
<s> hope this helps bob </s>
<s> if your dvd came with some install cd etc </s>
<s> then use it </s>
<s> it should contain any drivers plus the dvd player s w </s>
<s> if none then goto the support website of rosewell products you should at least get thier latest device drivers for that model dvd </s>
<s> while wmp win </s>
<s> media player will play dvds it isn t always the default player if not then select it as the pgm </s>
<s> to do so if it never did then something is amiss </s>
<s> get a free version of some media player for dvds </s>
<s> i tried vlc from with success </s>
<s> offhand i think you got a s w issue for now </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
