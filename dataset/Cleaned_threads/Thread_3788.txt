<s> i have an old motherboard that is used in a digital video recorder </s>
<s> the motherbaord is a 2003 bayfield the memory chip is a 256mb sdram ddr dimm 184 pc133 </s>
<s> i want to put a 1 gig chip in but not sure if the faster chips will work in the motherboard </s>
<s> i dont need the faster speed chip but they are all that is available now and also much cheaper </s>
<s> do you think a pc2700 or something similar will work in a 2003 bayfield motherboard </s>
<s> i think all it takes is one memory chip </s>
<s> i haven t opened the case up yet because i need it recording my store </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> pc133 should be 168 pin but you mentioned ddr 184 pc133 </s>
<s> that 184 is a valid pin count so i m not sure what you have but the mix isn t compatible </s>
<s> you ll need to open the case i suspect </s>
<s> i can t find that board at crucial so maybe it has another name </s>
<s> finds this board </s>
<s> the problem is that many chipsets didn t support such large memory sticks back then for simple reasons </s>
<s> i won t detail how the world has changed but i find some that find it incredible that a machine today doesn t support today s sticks and drives </s>
<s> but it is so </s>
<s> moving on </s>
<s> might be this board </s>
<s> does list a 1gb stick so all that you can do is try it and hope the stick s organization is fine </s>
<s> this is not to offer a course in memory tech but to write i find the speed to not be the problem here but the organization </s>
