<s> i really don t want to research this so was hoping for a quick answer from all you techies </s>
<s> i am going to europe end of june and want a tablet ipad or xoom to take as its less bulky than a laptop </s>
<s> i will be taking videos with my flip video camera and want to upload since amount of video is limited to about 3 hours on the flip </s>
<s> i see the xoom has a usb port does the ipad also </s>
<s> what recommendations can you give me </s>
<s> quot i really don t want to research this quot i won t fuss at you too much over this but to ask someone else to do the work for you because you don t feel like it irritates a fair amount of people </s>
<s> trying to find some answers yourself will usually help you learn more and it will make people think more highly of you </s>
<s> that is all i ve got to say about it </s>
<s> anyway i am fairly certain that you don t have to have any special software to use the flip camera </s>
<s> i think all you have to do is drag the files off of the device </s>
<s> the ipad 1 or 2 does not have a usb port </s>
<s> the motorola xoom does but i am not completely sure of whether it has mass storage support </s>
<s> the motorola xoom has a 32gb internal memory and part of that is dedicated to the operating system </s>
<s> i don t know how much is usable </s>
<s> i should have said i did do some research and came up empty and didn t feel like pressing on anymore and thought i d throw it out there for the experts to respond </s>
<s> sorry if i offended you and thanks for the information you were able to supply </s>
<s> and then quickly note in which it s hacked to give you usb host capability </s>
<s> my advice is to wait till more android pads roll out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> waiting quot until the roll out quot seems to be a never ending story </s>
<s> i m a multiply disabled guy who is homebound </s>
<s> fortunately for me my town has blanket wifi i don need no frakking 3 4g </s>
<s> p i don t want an ipad that costs more and has no usb sd slot or adobe flash a kindle dx costs so much yet does so little just 1 to 2 hundred more sometimes less gets me allot mores features </s>
<s> i do my due diligence and google my froogle in research but for a 10 quot android 3 0 the date of release gets further and further away quot december 2010 ok maybe january 2011 just kidding it s february </s>
<s> we lied it s march april fool s quot i m getting tired of it </s>
<s> sure there is the mortola xoom but the price is really high </s>
<s> i m looking at the notion ink asus ep101tc maybe the cheaper wifi only xoom that s supposedly coming but i m growing impatient </s>
<s> you did find that with a hack you got the xoom to do that trick but if a month or two is too long why not xoom </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it took me a year to save my 600 the xoom at it s price now is way to high </s>
<s> i could buy a laptop for less </s>
<s> even if i put the rest on my 25 apr card it d still take a huge bite out of my mothly budget </s>
<s> the only good part of waiting so long is my tablet saving build </s>
<s> why a tablet at all </s>
<s> why not the usual 399 buck dell laptop </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m a big reader and with my poor coordination you should see my typos before i correct and a laptop is a bit cumbersome to read with comfortably </s>
<s> even large print fonts now are only 20 minutes a day pc kindle now </s>
<s> they are also awkward to carry at doctors and in the hospitals </s>
<s> i m just going to read via kindle check mail view the jpg s family sends and maybe hulu com and games com </s>
<s> i would have bought a laptop as i do the above plus writing surfing and publisher </s>
<s> but someone bought me this hurl it crapperd and when you make less than 940 a month free is better and you look for the best bang for your buck </s>
<s> like i said multiple disabilities 100 deaf just shy of legally blind wheelchair bound partial paralysis and numbness </s>
<s> after extreme financial housing abuses by trustees formerly known as brothers i now look for the best i can get for what i have to spend </s>
<s> after all this the ipad is great and soon real soon there will be more droids that will peak everyone s interest </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i just saw the xoom wifi only is supposedly going to be released on the 22 or 27th i ve seen both </s>
<s> i ll pre order as soon as it s official </s>
