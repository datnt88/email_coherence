<s> hi here is my current setup </s>
<s> motherboard gigabyte 990fxa d3 cpu amd phenom x6 1045t graphics his radeon hd 6790 x2 in crossfirex ram 16gb gskill cheap value ram </s>
<s> psu coolermaster 550w os win 7 ultimate so i baught a new motherboard the other day along with another 6790 at a really good price </s>
<s> and for the last couple of days all sorts of strange things are happening </s>
<s> sometimes the computer will freeze while windows is loading at times the keyboard will turn off when i put my computer to sleep it will take itself out of sleep straight away and other times it will just not turn back on at all </s>
<s> and to top it off i turned it on earlier today and it wouldnt even post </s>
<s> so only after taking one graphics card and all but one ram stick it decides to work again </s>
<s> im really confused on what it could be </s>
<s> i was thinking it may be the psu but it is reasonably new and it seems to work again after re inserting the extra ram and psu </s>
<s> can anyone please shed some light on what they think the problem could be </s>
<s> says you need 600 watts if you now have two display cards </s>
<s> there s also amperes to measure </s>
<s> i d also wonder if you overclock </s>
<s> if so run it stock and see what happens but after you correct the psu issue </s>
<s> who sets it up and fixes this one </s>
<s> i wonder if there is something basically wrong with the machine </s>
<s> that is all nice parts but i could not figure out if said windows was a fresh install or some transplant </s>
<s> transplants usually go horribly wrong </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> my thought on the power supply is seems small </s>
<s> hope it s a single rail model </s>
<s> yeah i bult the system myself </s>
<s> i was thinking the same thing although the sysytem seems to be running smoothly over the past couple of days </s>
<s> all i have been really doing is basic websurfing and watching movies which doesnt really put much load on the psu </s>
<s> i might add that it is not overclocked at all </s>
<s> everything is running on factory settings </s>
<s> windows was a fresh install </s>
<s> so the problem doesnt lie there </s>
<s> i think stephen is right about the psu </s>
<s> so i guess ill just get a new one and then put it through its paces and see how i go </s>
<s> i was thinking of a 750w antec earth they are supose to be real good on power consumption </s>
<s> when you installed the drivers let s hope you installed the right variety for the win7 you did install as 32 or 64 bit type </s>
<s> while some 32 bit maybe accepted or seem so these in turn cause issues when they re pushed or possibility the drivers aren t too keen as really ready </s>
<s> so review all that don t fall what was available on the os install alone the drivers for the mtrbd </s>
<s> maybe lacking for your needs so a visit to the mtrbd </s>
<s> website for what you need </s>
<s> also in some cases if you re dragging some old part into the mix install the drivers from windows driver website when prompted allow it to install from the www </s>
<s> that one area i would check into as it maybe part of the overall siuues besides apsu one tada willy </s>
<s> i have just joined cnet trying to get some clarity on similar weird things happening to now 6 computers bought new all set up and two second hand </s>
<s> my technical understanding is very limited </s>
<s> i have given up on getting techs help though </s>
<s> they usually can t understand what is happening with my gear and my internet connections and online services </s>
<s> for example computers often wont start pressing the button does nothing </s>
<s> i took one to a tech and he handed it back a few days later said there was nothing wrong with it started straight away for him </s>
<s> he checked it thoroughly and could find nothing wrong and it kept starting for me after that but other things then happened to that one </s>
<s> three others have done the same not starting thing two intermittently </s>
<s> there may be a simple explanation for your problems but my conclusion with mine is that the computers are being sabotaged remotely </s>
<s> i could give many more examples and reasons i have come to this conclusion and also the conclusion that some protection against em beams and pulses is required </s>
<s> i have had similar experiences with tvs and radios </s>
<s> only one such device has not had weird things happening with it and that is a small sony radio and guess what it was specifically built by a public speaker who had such a protective device put in it as he was having problems of interference with its use providing translations to members of his audience </s>
