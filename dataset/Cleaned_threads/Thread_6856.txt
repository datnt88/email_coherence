<s> hi i have an internet connection landline and wifi modem at my parent s summerhouse as i need it for work </s>
<s> nobody else does around here so i get constant nagging from neighbours to give them the password </s>
<s> i can t say no however i m afraid they may use up too much of my bandwith connection which could lead to alot of money being lost from my part </s>
<s> constant and stable internet is a must for my work </s>
<s> hence my question how can i limit the bandwith i give to them </s>
<s> can i create a second public network with limited bandwith or something like that </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> and given they could download junk that gets you into trouble the answer must be no </s>
<s> given you d have to replace the router or create one from a linux box it s just not worth it to most folk and again it s back to just say no and then change the router to channel 14 i will deny i wrote this and then set your wifi to europe settings and they won t even see the wifi router to ask you </s>

<s> thanks for your answer </s>
<s> i am actually located in europe </s>
<s> they know i have a wifi internet connection as i sit on the porch and do work </s>
<s> saying no is also pretty much impossible as they have helped me out quite a few times </s>
<s> lt div gt so in order to limit the bandwith i allocate to them i have to get a new router </s>
<s> no other easier way </s>
<s> lt div gt </s>
<s> thanks for your answer </s>
<s> i am actually located in europe </s>

<s> is what you are asking for </s>
<s> this is not a common feature in routers but folk have put such into linux based routers but it seems expensive to run 100 or 200 or more watt computer to do this </s>
<s> is a page about these units </s>
<s> traffic shaping is the other common term used </s>
<s> read on linux </s>
<s> read hope this let s you see what you are in for </s>
