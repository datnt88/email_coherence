<s> my wd external hard drive after a re start went to raw file system and i cannot format this drive anymore i keep getting an error message quot windows was unable to format this drive quot </s>
<s> it s a 2tb hard drive and i have about 18gb of data on it </s>
<s> can anyone suggest what i can do to make this drive accessible and recover my data without having to pay over 100 to geek squad </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> try the data recovery programs mentioned in might work </s>
<s> might not work </s>
<s> you only know if you try </s>
<s> but where is your backup </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> that was my backup that was my external drive that i use to back up all my pictures and videos </s>
<s> i am a photographer </s>
<s> so the ubuntu will recover the data </s>
<s> i bought this hard drive only a few months ago might still be under warranty do you think they ll be able to do anything better </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i didn t mention ubuntu </s>
<s> i was thinking programs like getdataback zero assumption recovery recuva pandora </s>
<s> it s unlikely a standard os like linux will find that data </s>
<s> warranty doesn t include recovery </s>
<s> if they can t repair it you ll get another empty one </s>
<s> if they repair it there s a good chance they delete your data in the process </s>
<s> so don t count on that </s>
<s> so if all you lost is your backup you still have the originals </s>
<s> i d start with buying another hard disk to copy them to have another backup </s>
<s> and from that external drive to another pc of course so you have 2 copies besides the original </s>
<s> then keep the external on a safe place outside your office and you ll have an acceptable backup for professional environment </s>
<s> but webbased storage might even be better and easier </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> possible do another backup to the new hdd and check the alternatives for replacing the the other drive under warranty with wd </s>
<s> i had a fathom external drive that got the quot click of death quot and i lost all my data </s>
<s> so when i replaced it i bought the much more highly rated western digital my book </s>
<s> two months ago i heard the horrible quot click of death quot sound as it tried and tried to search for files and then failed </s>
<s> i finally got it to be recognized sort of by the computer </s>
<s> it assigned it a drive letter but indicated that the drive was completely unformatted </s>
<s> about one terebyte of data now gone </s>
<s> but there s an interesting end to this hard drive story </s>
<s> i didn t throw it away like i did the fathom </s>
<s> and the other day i gave it a try again but this time plugging it into a different circuit not the powerstrip where all my other components were plugged into </s>
<s> apparently the power converter this is just a guess of course was not pulling quite enough power from the shared power strip to power the drive </s>
<s> once it was on a seperate outlet it did just fine and i was able to access my data </s>
<s> i m not fully convinced something isn t wrong with the drive but i was able to salvage and tranfer the data to another external drive </s>
<s> kinda wierd </s>
<s> because i have several other hard drives all plugged into power strips and they all do just fine </s>
