<s> i never thought it could really happen but my pc did explode this morning </s>
<s> i was working on it as usual then i smelled a burning smell then a loud quot pop quot then my machine shut down on its own </s>
<s> i unplugged and opened it up to see what i could see but honestly i didn t know what to look for </s>
<s> i haven t cracked open the power supply yet but i wouldn t know what to look for </s>
<s> please help with any suggestions </s>
<s> i m so desperate </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> snap crackle and pop is good for breakfast cereal but bad for a power supply </s>
<s> don t even try to restart with the existing supply replace it and hopefully the damage was limited to that </s>
<s> you won t know until then </s>
<s> the sounds you heard were probably a quot capacitor quot that blew </s>
<s> the smell is related to it and probable near by circuits </s>
<s> check for a leaky bulging or simply extended cap these look like little barrels </s>
<s> it will be obivous once you ralize one or more are very different looking or hanging it guts out </s>
<s> inspect under good lighting </s>
<s> as the other poster said swap out the power supply if you crack its cover as caps are all over the system </s>
<s> beware if serious damage the mtrbd </s>
<s> is best replaced but a cap can be replaced but no guarntee it will fix the problem </s>
<s> fyi in the past 18 24mo </s>
<s> a capacitor problem is known from a bad manufacturing source </s>
<s> here s a link to review good luck willy </s>
