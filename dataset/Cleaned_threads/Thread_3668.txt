<s> i have not used seagate hard drives for a long time so don t know if this is normal </s>
<s> it makes a lot of noise the the western digital drives don t </s>
<s> this started when i had 3 bsod in one day and as soon as it would re boot it would go right into chkdsk </s>
<s> the computer is still under warranty so i called dell and after some trouble shooting steps it was determined the hard drive is going bad </s>
<s> the tech came out the next day and installed a new seagate hard drive that s the one making noise that sounds like someone tapping on the bottom of a aluminium can with a pencil or stick </s>
<s> not real load but very anoying </s>
<s> turns out the drive was sent with the wrong image and they have to send another hard drive to replace this one </s>
<s> the tech will be here tomorrow and i have no idea what brand hard drive it will be </s>
<s> is this noise normal with the seagate drives or was i just very unlucky </s>
<s> thanks wayne </s>
<s> the tech was a day early and installed the drive today </s>
<s> it was another seagate drive and this one you can t hear at all so the first one must have been bad </s>
<s> one bonus is the first drive was a 640 gig and the new one is a 1 terabyte drive </s>
<s> to me it sounds like some harmonic being created and emanating from the cover </s>
<s> you said a pencil tapping on a can </s>
<s> the covers on newer drives can be very thin and made to flex easily </s>
<s> that could be just the way it sounds when the heads move and the vibration is picked up by the cover </s>
<s> putting some foam tape on it might have reduced the noise </s>
<s> of course the 1tb drive will be a different model and could be made differently </s>
<s> as long as you re happy with it that s fine but don t think that all drive noise is an omen of impending doom </s>
<s> the 1 terabyte drive has been working great and still no noise </s>
<s> one thing is it appears the bigger drive is actaully faster than the 640 i thought it would be just the opposite </s>
<s> this is not only the seak time but also boot up and shut down </s>
