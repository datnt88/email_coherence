<s> i am needing to replace my old cat5 patch cables in my comms room does anyone have a suggestion as to what are the best brand of cables to buy </s>
<s> i will be buying different colours depending on the job i am asking each cable to do </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> this is a product like milk </s>
<s> you see brands at the store but all go fine with cheerios </s>
<s> the only thing you may want to do is to buy the normal as well as a quot crossover quot type so you know you have both types handy </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply bob the reason i asked was i was told that some of the cheaper pre cut cable is assembled in places like tiwan or china and they do not test there cables properly </s>
<s> we buy ours from geeks com and found one bad one in some thousand </s>
<s> i guess some would consider that unacceptable </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> cat 5e patch cables will do the trick if all your other cabling is cat 5 or cat 5e </s>
<s> you will only be as good as the weakest part of your cabling network </s>
<s> i would match up with at least cat 5e </s>
<s> these guys have them starting at 79 ea </s>
<s> and in lengths from 6 inches to 150 ft and in 9 different colors </s>
<s> barry i know i m getting here late on this one but here s a link to our website that provides more cable options than you could dream of </s>
<s> you could also call at 724 746 5500 24 x 7 technical support team black box network services </s>
<s> thanks but i am based is scotland so i would not purchase from america </s>
