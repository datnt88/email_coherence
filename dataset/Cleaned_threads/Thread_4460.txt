<s> i have a kodak easyshare p720 picture frame </s>
<s> i have a 2 gigabyte flash drive on which i have put approx 170 pictures jpg when i try to move certain pics to the flash drive on my computer pc there is an error 0x80070052 </s>
<s> unable to create file or directory </s>
<s> this doesn t make sense </s>
<s> they are relatively small files same as the others </s>
<s> when i check the properties of the files on my computer which i want to transfer to the flash drive it s 110 megabytes well below the capacity of the flash drive </s>
<s> there are some other concerns about the picture frame itself like it says the about 20 files are quot bad quot </s>
<s> i deleted all files on the flash drive and then uploaded them 12 at a time again </s>
<s> some other issues specific to the frame i will deal with later </s>
<s> any clues about this </s>
<s> the top directory can only hold so many files in spite of a gigabyte free </s>
<s> so no matter how big the card is you ll see this again and again </s>
<s> fix </s>
<s> make a folder and put pictures in a folder </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob so does the frame open the folders and go through each one </s>
<s> how does that work </s>
<s> i wonder why there s no mention of that anywhere that i ve found so far anyway </s>
<s> how can one tell the size limit of a folder </s>
<s> please try this and see what happens </s>
<s> yes it s mentioned on the web </s>
<s> i ll give you the google so you can research this if you wish </s>
<s> sorry i have no knowledge of what they did in that device so i can only offer there is an issue with the top folder </s>
