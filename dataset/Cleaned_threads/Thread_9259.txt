<s> 1 what equipment to get this done </s>

<s> you need a audio recordning program </s>
<s> nero and roxio have one in their suites </s>
<s> hook the loptop into the church sound system record your sermon </s>
<s> edit the file if necessary save it as a mp3 </s>

<s> john </s>
<s> hi john thanks for your reply </s>
<s> i currently have no way to hook my laptop into our system </s>
<s> it is a very odd arrangement and old with just one mic and cord that runs approx </s>
<s> 30 under the platform to a box that allows us to control the volume </s>
<s> i was hopeing for a solution that would allow me to use a wireless mic that would be picked up by some type of sensor off of the usb on my laptop </s>
<s> i would then use nero or roxio to do the actual recording </s>
<s> do you have any further thoughts </s>
<s> nate </s>
<s> the existing microphone has to go to some type of mixer or mixer amp and then out of the amp to the speakers in the room </s>
<s> you could place a mixer with more than one output before the amp </s>
<s> use one output for the speakers in the room and use the other to connect to the audio input line in in the laptop </s>
<s> if your laptop doesn t have one you can get an external usb box or a pc card model </s>
<s> i don t know how your odd and old hardware will behave with these devices though </s>
<s> usb box creative makes a pc card model look at the typical sound system diagram on p 8 of this link shure makes great microphones you could have a parallel sound system </s>
<s> you could just tape a cheap usb mic to your existing mic and run the line to your laptop that will record right behind the podium </s>
<s> looking for something more elegant like wireless huh </s>
<s> i don t know of any wireless usb microphones other than telephone headsets but there are good wireless microphones that will transmit to a receiver </s>
<s> you then could run a line out of the wireless receiver to your a mic port on your computer s external audio box </s>
<s> or make it easy 1 visit a local electronics store that caters to musicians or a musical instrument showroom </s>
<s> ask how they would do it </s>
<s> 2 visit radioshack and ask them what they would do </s>
<s> this gives me alot to think over and to research </s>
<s> thanks for taking the time to write out some detailed ideas </s>
