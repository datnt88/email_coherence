<s> i will be going home soon after finishing up a several year job i m in </s>
<s> so i ve been trying to plan out how i am going to have the same setup i have now with tv ps3 xbox printer network storage etc etc </s>
<s> all i have now is a wireless router with all ports 4 being used and a lot of things using wireless </s>
<s> going home there will be even more on the network families computers and such so i came up with an idea if the idea works </s>
<s> i m no networking expert however i will be going to school to learn </s>
<s> anyway my plan if possible is this isp switch 1st port to my families wireless router and a 2nd port to my wireless router and each in their own vlan to separate them completely from each other </s>
<s> i ll will only use those 2 ports on the switch </s>
<s> and i will connect everything i have to only my router and the rest of the family can use just their router </s>
<s> is this possible </s>
<s> or am i way off </s>
<s> and if i am right do you have any suggestions for home use switches </s>
<s> thank you for your help in advance </s>
<s> as you will need a second internet ip it usually doubles the monthly fees </s>
<s> you could do like me and set up your quot router as a wap quot see google and connect a lan port on the first router to the lan port of the second router to get your own wifi </s>
<s> wifi gets clogged up fast so why not your own </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if both routers were having all their ports used would this be an easy correct setup </s>
<s> isps modem gt uplink port of wired router gt port 1 and port 2 of wired router to uplink ports for the two wireless routers </s>
<s> i would not do that setup </s>
<s> but as you thought it through what will happen why not </s>
<s> that is any setup you want can be done if you want it to </s>
<s> but here i go with setups we use and support </s>
<s> i don t see how that setup would be easy </s>
