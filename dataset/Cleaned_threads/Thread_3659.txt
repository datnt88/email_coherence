<s> what factors affect compatibility of crt monitors with cpus by various manufacturers </s>
<s> for instance can a dell cpu be used with an hp monitor without any serious considerations </s>
<s> of course they would be both be recent models using the windows xp home os </s>
<s> after recurring dell monitor problems that have never been resolved it seems necessary to consider another option </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> since a cpu has nothing to do with crt monitor compatibility that s a non starter </s>
<s> what can make a difference is the video card in use and more important what video mode screen settings that you want </s>
<s> cheap displays sometimes didn t do 1280x1024 dots at 100 hz for instance </s>
<s> but all that seems to be a long gone issue and all you need to do is get a vga display with the display settings you use to be less than what the monitor is capable of </s>
<s> no one makes their own custom displays in the mass market pc channels since that would be cost prohibitive </s>
<s> in short you want a vga display bob </s>
<s> thanks for your response to my question about desktop compatible monitors </s>
<s> i did not feel it was a real issue but wanted to confirm it before making any changes </s>
