<s> i m planning to add a dvd rom to my new computer it currently has a dvd cd rw drive with light scribe </s>
<s> i ve found numerous models much cheaper than i ever could have imagined 17 to 25 but have no idea what i m looking for or what names mean quality </s>
<s> some of the brands i ve found are benq toshiba lite on lg samsung sony asus </s>
<s> can anyone recommend one of those brands over another </s>
<s> do the dvd rom access times cd rom access times and cache times mean a lot </s>
<s> for dvd rom access times the one i like has 80 220ms but others have as low as a constant 90ms </s>
<s> for cd rom access times the one i like as 165ms but others have as low as 95ms for cache the one i like has 512k but other have as much as 2m </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> tbb </s>
<s> for 40 usd or less you can get a dual layer dvd rw drive that will work with all major media types </s>
<s> the more cache the better </s>
<s> 2mb cache works great for me i can t justify 2x 3x the for 8mb </s>
<s> as for brands i have had good experiences with nec and sony </s>
<s> my method </s>
<s> i was looking at just a dvd rom drive because i already have a dvd rw drive in my computer and was told that there may be some conflict within the computer when trying to burn items because of having two different burners </s>
<s> do you feel that 512k of cache is too little </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> tbb </s>
<s> 512k is too little if you like speedy drives </s>
<s> get the 2mb cache drive </s>
<s> i don t have a problem with multiple dvd rw drives </s>
<s> you just tell your burning software which drive to use when you go to burn discs very easy </s>
<s> i think it is wise to purchase a second dvd burner instead of a read only drive since your old drive will fail at some point as all drives do and the dual layer dvd burners are so inexpensive these days </s>
<s> nevertheless the bottom line is always your budget </s>
