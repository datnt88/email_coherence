<s> i just purchased a new computer </s>
<s> i am sort of illiterate in what to do next </s>
<s> i want to take everything off of my old computer and put it onto the new one </s>
<s> i have already removed the items i don t want to keep but have pictures music documents etc that i want to keep </s>
<s> i also want to be able to leave some things on the old computer for my son to use </s>
<s> i am going to have xp on the new one and windows 98se on the old one so i want to leave that </s>
<s> my </s>
<s> is how do i take the stuff from the old one to the new one is that done by copying everything to cdr s and then downloading them into the new computer somehow </s>
<s> if so is there a place that will instruct me step by step how to do this </s>
<s> and if i copy everything on my c drive isn t that all i will need to put on the new computer or should something else also be copied and put on the new computer </s>
<s> it is a new dell dimension 4700 if that makes a difference </s>
<s> any help you could provide would be much appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> pam </s>
<s> pam perhaps this detailed link will help you </s>
<s> you can purchase intellimover which makes the whole process very simple </s>
<s> pam i too will soon be faced with that same dilemma my 6 year old pc which is very old runs on win 95 is a p2 or a p3 and has a 4 0gb hd </s>
<s> you mentioned you have a new dell 4700 is it a dell 4700 or the mini tower dell 4700c </s>
<s> how long have you had it and how do you like it </s>
<s> anything come up yet requiring you to contact dell s tech support </s>
<s> big steve end of message 02 16 05 </s>
<s> steve i got the 4700 instead of the c model </s>
<s> i wanted the larger one because that s what i am used to and they could do it faster because on the smaller one evidently everything had to be redone and would take longer to make </s>
<s> this is my second dell </s>
<s> the original one i am using now is over 5 years old and never been serviced </s>
<s> i have a brother in law that owns an insurance company and says he never has any problems with his dell s has 20 of them but the 5 that are other brands give him trouble all of the time </s>
<s> i chose another dell since i love their products and service </s>
<s> they helped me with info that was stupid all through the warranty time and even after the tech support was supposed to be over for me </s>
<s> anyway it is still in the boxes in the hall and i haven t done the transfer work but the info that i received from these very gracious people will help me do it the right way </s>
<s> incidentally i ordered the dell at 8 30 on wednesday night and it was delivered to my door in complete with exactly what i wanted on friday at noon </s>
<s> and that was with extra features added to my order and alot of changes made </s>
<s> can you believe that service </s>
<s> thanks pam </s>
<s> thank you so much for the link to the article </s>
<s> i have read this in full and understand it better </s>
<s> i believe i can tackle this now and get to using my new pc </s>
<s> i appreciate your help </s>
<s> pam </s>
