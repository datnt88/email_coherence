<s> i am tring to install a new video card </s>
<s> i bought the nvidia g force fx5700 pci card made by apollo </s>
<s> i install the card and at boot up the screen goes blank </s>
<s> i have taken the card out and re installed it several times </s>
<s> please help thanks ahead of time </s>
<s> ok be sure thr agp port is updated that may mean a bios update </s>
<s> then disable the on board video not agp port but the build in video if so equiped </s>
<s> if none then make sure the mtrbd </s>
<s> drivers are current updated </s>
<s> then try the new video card install </s>
<s> if it still fails enetr the bios again and set to quot safe mode quot or default setting edit only to accept current hds and cds present </s>
<s> try the install again </s>
<s> also make sure you have the latest nvida drivers either from apollo or nvida support website for your os do that before the install having them on your system thus point to them when installing new card or as required </s>
<s> even though you reseta the video card make sure its fully seated inspect closely </s>
<s> the system mtrbd </s>
<s> support website may have instructions on how to install different video upgrade supporting the above or vary slightly </s>
<s> last there s the possibility either the cvard card is supported or bad </s>
