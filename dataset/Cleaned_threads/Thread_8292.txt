<s> hi i have 2 imacs at home a g4 and a g5 </s>
<s> i love them </s>
<s> i now need to buy a lap top for my work </s>
<s> the question is should i buy a windows or a mac </s>
<s> i would love to get a mac but i am concerned that at this time some programs will not run on it and it is work related even given the new boot camp software </s>
<s> advice </s>
<s> thanks galit </s>
<s> i understood i could be wrong that using boot camp allowed windows to run as windows </s>
<s> have you done any research into the feasibility of running your particular program s on a mac running windows </s>
<s> there is also a utility called parallel which also allows windows to run on a mac </s>
<s> armed with a copy of your program head off to your local apple store reseller and ask them to test it for you </s>
<s> they should be happy to do so </s>
<s> let us know how you get on p </s>
<s> i don t have a specific program that i am currently running on windows </s>
<s> i m just worried that at some point i will need to run a business related program that will not work on the mac </s>
<s> and worry when it became necessary </s>
<s> at that point you could fire up windows and go for it </s>
<s> life is too short to worry about things that quot might happen maybe quot </s>
<s> besides murphy s law says that if you get the windows machine there will never be a windows specific program required for work </s>
<s> i have not heard of any programs not running under boot camp you would have to be specific to find that out </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> i feel it would depend on your line of work </s>
<s> if you work in the corporate world then i would suggest getting a laptop from dell or hp or some other company </s>
<s> if your line of work is more informal or more personal like you work by yourself or use the laptop as more of a personal computer while doing some work on it i would suggest the apple laptop </s>
<s> it doesnt really matter about the software running on the computer anymore unless its a very complicated software more software is able to run on both types of laptops </s>
<s> all computers can run windows now but in the corporate world its better to have a windows based pc </s>
<s> an apple based pc is more simple and personal but can also dualboot to windows for running additional programs </s>
<s> you are very quick to down the mac os x for some reason which is something that is normally found in someone who has never used it and has no experience of the os </s>
<s> why exactly is it better to have a windows based pc in the corporate world rather than having a mac </s>
<s> after all you did say in another post that all computers can run windows now </s>
<s> so a mac running windows would be the same as any other machine running windows is that right </s>
<s> if not why not </s>
<s> an apple based pc is more simple and personal what exactly does that mean </s>
<s> you have first hand information that you would like to qualify that statement with </s>
<s> go ahead we re listening p </s>
