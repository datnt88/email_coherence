<s> i have a main desktop computer as well as a laptop </s>
<s> i also have an hp printer connected to the desktop via usb </s>
<s> i would like to be able to print wirelessly from the laptop using the same printer </s>
<s> the printer is also able to connect via quot built in networking to connect to 10base t 100base tx networks quot i m not sure what that means but there is an ethernet port on the back of the printer as well or maybe lan </s>
<s> i don t know the difference </s>
<s> so how can i accomplish this </s>
<s> let me know if you need computer info </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> 1 share the printer from that desktop </s>
<s> install the printer software and driver on the laptop </s>
<s> 2 connect the printer via ethernet and install the printer software and driver </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> when i started to install the software on the laptop it asks how i am connecting the printer </s>
<s> the options are usb and lan </s>
<s> i m assuming if i go with option 1 that you suggested i would use usb but would that allow me to print wirelessly from the laptop </s>
<s> is it necessary to set up both computers on a network </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if your printer has an ethernet port then it is possible to give the computer an ip address </s>
<s> first thing you want to do is give the printer an ip address on the same network as your computers </s>
<s> go to both computers and run ipconfig </s>
<s> more than likely the ip will be like 192 168 0 x </s>
<s> record both ip address and there will also be a 255 x x x number called the subnet mask </s>
<s> you also need the default gateway </s>
<s> all this information can be obtained by going to start gt run gt type cmd gt once inside he command prompt black screen you are going to type gt ipconfig gt get the ip address ipv 4 subnet mask and the gateway </s>
<s> all these numbers will have the same format </s>
<s> 192 168 0 x </s>
<s> any ip from 1 to 254 where that x is the ip that you are going to use for the printer </s>
<s> just make sure that your two computers are not using that ip address by running ipconfig in black screen </s>
<s> now find the network settings on the printer </s>
<s> enter the same subnet mask and default gateway as the computers have that you got from running ipconfig in the blackscreen </s>
<s> all you need is an ip address that is one number greater than your biggest ip address and make sure to verify the ip is not being used by another device on your network </s>
<s> ex </s>
<s> after running ipconfig in dos screen black screen ip add 192 168 0 1 1st pc 192 168 0 2 2nd pc subnet mask 255 255 255 0 gateway or default gateway 192 168 0 3 ip for your printer set to manual 192 168 0 4 you would use same gateway and subnet mask once you have set this on your printer go to add a printer on your pcs connect network printer using network not local may try to find the printer do not select </s>
<s> you want to make sure that printer is added by ip address where it says hostname or ip </s>
<s> here you would enter the 192 168 0 x ip of your printer </s>
<s> click next </s>
<s> try using the residing driver </s>
<s> if you do not have drivers for the printer go the manufacturer website of the printer and look for drivers depending on your computer manufacturer </s>
<s> this is the full setup for you </s>
<s> first thanks a lot for your detailed description i appreciate it i do have a few questions though </s>
<s> 1 in your example the printer ip address was one more than the default gateway is that a mistake cuz you said one more than the pc s ip addresses </s>
<s> 2 you said to quot make sure to verify the ip is not being used by another device on your network quot i m not sure what you mean by this i don t think i have a network set up </s>
<s> do i have to actually do something in order to set up a network </s>
<s> 3 where does the other end of the printer ethernet cable go </s>
<s> phone jack in the wall </s>
<s> 4 when adding a printer it asks the quot device type quot the options are quot autodetect tcp ip device and web services device quot which do i choose </s>
<s> sorry for all of the questions i m just not really familiar with this type of thing thanks again </s>
<s> i listed 2 scenarios and each one differs a little in the install and setup </s>
