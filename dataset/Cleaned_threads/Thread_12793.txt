<s> quot in fact there are only three non overlapping channels 1 6 and 11 quot that s a great nugget of information if you are moving your channels about to get away from some interference </s>

<s> very interesting article </s>
<s> i have just obtained and returned a d link 624 g router because the new firmware would not allow me to select a channel </s>
<s> the article implies that when operating in the 108 mode you lose the ability to select channels </s>
<s> what was frustrating was that no one in tech support at d link had a clue as to why i was locked in on channel 6 it appears that this simply is the way the implementation is suppose to work </s>
<s> i also found posts about the netgear 108 product where people are complaining about being locked into only one channel </s>
<s> is this truly the way the implementation is suppose to work </s>
<s> if so would you not think that the vendor s own tech support would know this </s>
<s> harvey </s>
<s> in the outsourced support they are usually spoonfed what someone thinks they need </s>
<s> i find today s outsourced support to not have a ready path back to the developers or someone who can look into the issue </s>
<s> as you rightly discerned that mode spills over the channels so there is no way they should allow you to flip channels in that proprietary mode </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> out of curiosity i went back to the d link site and brought up the 108g documentation </s>
<s> under the faq an answer to quot enabling the super g mode quot also stated that only channel 6 can be used </s>
<s> i obviously missed this when i originally checked out the site </s>
<s> amazing that tech support did not know this </s>
<s> as a result i returned a functioning router and d link lost a sale </s>
<s> fwiw i was trying this router because of a perceived issue with a belkin wireless g router with which i was intermittently losing the internet connection from my motorola sb4200 cable modem i have posted about this on this group a few weeks ago </s>
<s> after returning the d link i went out and purchased with the right to return an rca cable modem since the sb4200 was also a suspect comcast would not allow me to have a new modem since it quot worked o k quot directly connected </s>
<s> anyway it now appears that the sb4200 was the problem </s>
<s> it s been almost 4 5 days and i ve not had a disconnect 4 6 times daily with the sb4200 </s>
<s> furthermore my upload speeds have increased by about 20 </s>
<s> i m tempted to try the d link again except for their poor tech support and the very good support i received from belkin sent me out a brand new field tested router also very easy to get to their tech support people </s>
<s> harvey </s>
<s> the issue was their router that on some number of browses would direct the user to an advertisement </s>
<s> the recoil was such that belkin was beat up on the web </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my problem of course was not related to the quot spying quot issue </s>
<s> my issue started before the advertisement flap </s>
<s> however belkin did appear to respond apologize quickly </s>
<s> in fact their is a new firmware update on their site put there a few days ago that removes the advertising code </s>
