<s> i have a old dell inspiron 1200 with a intel celeron r m 1 30ghz 1 24 gb i want to change it to a intel pentium 4 2 4 ghz is it possible i am going to upgrade the cooling on it but will pentium 4 work please let me know thanks </s>
<s> the difference in power requirement and heat production besides any other issue means you are unlikely to accomplish this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i suspect this is a laptop which tends to limit cpu upgrades </s>
<s> if this can be done you will need the m version or mobile cpu of that p4 otherwise if this becomes a desktop cpu it has been done they were extensively cooled to work </s>
<s> so even if you could cool it better i don t see it happening well from what the maker provides </s>
<s> this also may not be a direct unplug cpu and drop in new cpu arrangement </s>
<s> it maybe one of the quot moduled cpu quot and thus again has to be a true replacement or if capable resolder new for old </s>
<s> so overall this isn t as easy as it seems </s>
<s> if you haven t already look at the cpu once torn down or review its repair manual if available </s>
<s> you maybe lucky here as dell offers that in many cases unlike other makers just the users guide </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
