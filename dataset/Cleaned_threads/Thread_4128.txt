<s> hello i am interesed in attaching small containers trays about 2 4 inches in width to my flat screen monitor </s>
<s> i was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to attach the tray to the monitor without it scratching my monitor </s>
<s> ideally i would like the option for the container to be next to the side of the monitor or to be hidden behind the monitor </s>
<s> this would mean that whatever the container is attached to must be flexible enough so that i can slide the tray to the back of the monitor </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> first you need to create the container </s>
<s> on one side of the object have two loops extending from the top and bottom </s>
<s> take a small rod and place over it two rods each with a swivel joint at the top and bottom of this rod with rubber washers to stabilize the area and prevent unnecessary moving </s>
<s> connect the rod through the loops and cap off the top and bottom to prevent slipping </s>
<s> with each rod running perpendicular to your box make another rod with an arm in the middle and attach the two connecting rods at the top and bottom </s>
<s> make a small plate with two loops close together and attach the other end of the rod to the plate </s>
<s> from the plate create a set of legs that wrap around and attach small screws with soft feet at the bottom </s>
<s> you can use suction cups </s>
<s> use this makeshift vise to attach the plate to the monitor </s>
<s> if i knew what it was for i might be able to help you </s>
<s> the container will be similar to a round ashtray </s>
<s> in the container you can put either paperclips ipod phone or post it notes </s>
<s> it would contain things you use or reach for everyday in an office setting </s>
<s> i would like to clip this to my flat screen monitor </s>
<s> the container will be at the side of the monitor but should be able to move to the back of the monitor if i want to hide it </s>
<s> what materials do i need to ask for when i go to a local hardware store </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> it sounds like a good idea </s>
<s> the only problem is that my container will not have a top open container </s>
<s> it will look similar to a round ashtray and might be angled a little bit so that the person sitting in the chair can see what s in the container and be able to reach for it </s>
<s> if i were to go to home depot i would ask for 2 loops 2 rods 2 swivel joints 2 rubber washers and a small plate what kind brand </s>
<s> sorry i m not familiar with all this new terminology </s>
<s> and in case you re wondering it s for a class project </s>
<s> and yes i am in way over my head </s>
<s> noteholders on the sides of the monitor plus an adhesive tray below </s>
<s> you can also pick up the tray featured in the above picture </s>
<s> thanks for sharing the links </s>
<s> it s useful </s>
<s> but this is a class project and i have to make it </s>
<s> compare the design given to a human arm </s>
<s> the box can be the hand itself </s>
<s> the rod which connects is the metacarpus </s>
<s> the two rods are the radius and ulna </s>
<s> the second bar with three rods can be considered the elbow </s>
<s> the last single rod is the humerus </s>
<s> you re being given a design that will work </s>
<s> if you make it you can patent it and never have to give credit </s>
<s> this will represent the side of the container gt this will represent a loop on the side gt </s>
<s> lt that is the design </s>
<s> or like a letter d d now using symbols here for two rods for the connecting rod for the representation of the humerus </s>
<s> we have as the basic design </s>
<s> i have to use more letter for a representation of the design d as one end and p as the other </s>
<s> using this we create what the rod may look like </s>
<s> d p this being the two ends of the horizontal rod which will fit over the vertical one and allow motion based on a simple hinge design </s>
<s> like i said put this together take the credit patent it and you won t have to give anyone credit </s>
<s> it s also known as being lazy and not doing things for yourself </s>
<s> in case you didn t notice this is a forum where people share their knowledge and expertise </s>
<s> i am in this forum to get familiar with something that is unfamiliar to me </s>
<s> i have never built anything </s>
<s> i want to become familiar with different tools and hardware that might be helpful for my project </s>
<s> again this is a class project </s>
<s> i plan on doing this myself </s>
<s> to resort to calling people names is uncalled for undeserved and unnecessary especially when all i simply want to do is to become familiar with materials in a hardware store </s>
<s> nonetheless i thank you for your previous help but i wish that you did not give your input in the first place if you were going to write such such a mean spirited second posting </s>
<s> i can assure you i will not use your idea or your design </s>
<s> didn t you learn basic human anatomy and the six simple machines in school </s>
<s> i am going to assume this is a basic engineering project and you are asking people that have little or no expertise in that field </s>
