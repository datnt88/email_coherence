<s> i m a sucker for devices </s>
<s> if i don t already have it hooked into my usb string of hubs i have at least tried it </s>
<s> i am also a sucker for leaving all sorts of software freebies or on my computer </s>
<s> the cpu must look like a demolition derby </s>
<s> this little piece of code screaching to a halt while another piece of code finishes with a resource </s>
<s> yep sooner or later some little piece of code will fall asleep at the wheel and blow that stop sign </s>

<s> the dreaded system crash </s>
<s> with 148 seperate applications 250 000 seperate files try a virus scan on that </s>

<s> it s no wonder that device drivers don t know how to drive smurk smurk </s>
<s> let s face it some driver programmers can t program worth a squat and you know who you are </s>
<s> this is especially true for that cute little mouse that wags a tail every time you double click </s>

<s> i don t think so </s>
<s> what do you think </s>
<s> i m outta here </s>
<s> and the 127 usb devices was demonstrated years ago </s>
<s> you may have missed the demo </s>
<s> but they used a clean machine under best of circumstances </s>
<s> try it with a machine running 90 processes </s>
<s> it won t work </s>
<s> i think that explained it well </s>
