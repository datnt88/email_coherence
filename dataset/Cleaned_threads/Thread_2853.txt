<s> hi i have just ordered new parts for a computer which has not yet arrived including a sapphire radeon x1950pro 512mb ddr3 and two monitors with only vga input </s>
<s> the graphics card has dual dvi output and i was hoping to just use two converters dvi vga to connect the screens </s>
<s> i have now however just read that some dvi outputs called dvi d do not support these adapters and cannot be used on vga monitors </s>
<s> please tell me if this graphics card will work with them or not </s>
<s> i can t seem to find if it does or not on the aria co uk website </s>
<s> it only says digital video standard digital visual interface dvi many thanks </s>
<s> dvi d is an older interface normally what you ll find is dvi i which works fine with vga to dvi adapters </s>
<s> additionally if the card is including adapters likely an indicator of the adapters working sapphire wouldn t sell you extras that won t work with the main product wastes their money </s>
<s> one thing on using dvi to vga adapters ensure they are attached firmly before you attach the monitor if they wiggle around it can actually bend their plugs and cause various distortion on the screen </s>
<s> also as it sounds like you wanna do multi monitor with this x1950 remember to download hydravision from ati if it isn t included on the cd it ll give you better driver side support for multiple displays </s>
<s> ok that s great thanks i think the card should be fine then if it is only the older cards that usually have dvi d i will download the hydravision too when i get the system setup </s>
<s> thanks again for the quick reply </s>
<s> if your card has dvi i or dvi d outputs a single dvi d gt vga or dvi i gt vga adapter is usually included in the box unless it is quot white box quot in which case only the last driver the card manufacturer released will be included in the package along with no adapters or cables other than the card itself </s>
<s> ati has always been good about supplying all necessary cables and adapters in their retail packages </s>
<s> quot white box quot editions are horses of a different color </s>
<s> you might get lucky tho if you went quot white box quot to save money </s>
<s> sometimes all necessary adapters and cables are included with the card in a quot white box quot </s>
