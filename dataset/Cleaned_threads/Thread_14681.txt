<s> good morning hope someone can help me this morning i have been recovering medically for the last 2 months and not on my home network lt xbox has been a godsend gt anyways my niece has been living at the house helping around and i gave her permission to use my home network </s>
<s> this morning i get online only to find my encryption is down on my wireless network and i see a few new computers on the network right now i am seeing nothing but red on this whole subject </s>
<s> i ve installed network view and have their ipaddresses but cannot get into them </s>
<s> other than throwing up my encyption and firewalls and everyother bloody thing i can imagine is there anything i can do to either put the fear of me into my niece on their computer lt she has a friend over gt or any other idea </s>
<s> am petrified to find out what else i might have on my computer network at least my virus protection is up to date and running </s>
<s> will be running thta in 10 seconds </s>
<s> any one else have any other things i should be on the look out for or scanning for </s>
<s> have avg and avira for the virus protection </s>
<s> will probably need to get a million other d l for bugs and stuff and i don t even wannna think about p2p lt her older sister put limewire and aim onto one of my crappy computers 3 years ago and i still find weird links in it since i didn t format the harddrive gt sigh </s>
<s> am frankly just livid right now and not living up to my name no so serenity </s>
<s> should note the issues with wep or no security </s>
<s> wep is cracked in about 120 seconds or less so for wifi we move to wpa </s>
<s> try that </s>
<s> since there are unknown machines on your wifi change to wpa now and the unauthorized machines will be tossed out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i strongly agree to put a security encryption to your wireless network so that none of neighbors and other people may connect and also it will increase your internet speed since it will minimize the internet user but make sure you take of the password you will create it will came in handy in the future </s>
