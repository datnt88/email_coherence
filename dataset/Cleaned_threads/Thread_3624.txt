<s> i have just bought an external hard disk philips 250gb spd5110cc ostensibly for backups </s>
<s> but i m wondering if there s any reason i can t use it as a main disk not for windows itself of course </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> thanks chalkbel </s>
<s> the drive even on usb 2 0 is 1 2 to less the speed of internal drives and prone to vanishing </s>
<s> read it is a fine copy but fails on too many points for real backup </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> once the ext </s>
<s> hd is attached its resources are available </s>
<s> however continued use in such a matter defeats the purpose of a quot back up hd quot since it no longer is as safe as it can be </s>
<s> you expose it to any malware threat and possibility power problems or any other system problem </s>
<s> in its simplest terms a back up hd stores related data to be used later if and when needed </s>
<s> you can partition the ext </s>
<s> hd and place important data in a partition then use the other partion as necessary but again you comprise it should anything happen to the ext </s>
<s> hd itself </s>
<s> if you read the threads here problems crop up to ext </s>
<s> attached devices hds or not so its not an invalid caution to safeguard as best as possible </s>
<s> of course do what you need to do </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks bob willy i think the answer is no </s>
<s> it s ok i was just wondering but that s a clear indication from you both as to the way i should go </s>
<s> i have plenty of hdd space so no problem </s>
<s> thanks chalkbel </s>
