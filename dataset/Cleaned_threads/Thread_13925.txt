<s> before my trusty roommate was shipped off to iraq i bought his router so now i have two exactly same routers the linksys wrt320n </s>
<s> both units are still using oem firmware </s>
<s> i have been searching online to find out how i can use both in my network </s>
<s> i would like to use one for g network at 2 4mhz and another for n at 5mhz </s>
<s> the information i found online is very technical and for a noob like myself little hard to follow </s>
<s> can anyone here give some pointers on how to set up my network </s>
<s> i have been researching online for the past week or so and i am still confused </s>
<s> the top posts about post 18 and 19 note how to do this </s>
<s> this will not help those that can t configure the wifi portion of the router but it shows how to get both connected and working </s>

<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> is this the link you are referring to in your post </s>
<s> if so then how many routers can i daisy chain in this manner </s>
<s> can i add a third router as a access point </s>
<s> so linksys 1 n 5mhz linksys 2 n 2 4mhz airlink 3 g 2 4mhz would this set up be possible without too much interference </s>
<s> or should i just drop the airlink and focus on the two linksys </s>
<s> thank you once again bob looking forward to your reply </s>
<s> if our netmask is 255 255 255 0 we have some 254 devices we can assign addresses to </s>
<s> we are at 253 possible more waps but then that would have no clients so my answer is 251 waps with one client </s>
