<s> i recently bought an hp pavilion a1310n desktop pc </s>
<s> when i place a dvd movie in my computer i get the message quot no windows 2000 compatible dvd decoder installed on this system quot i like windows 2000 and dislike windows xp so i had wiped xp off the system and installed 2000 for the most part it went well though there are three drivers i am still trying to track down and install </s>
<s> how can i find out what dvd decoder needs to be installed on this system </s>
<s> any ideas on where i can find it </s>
<s> i very much appreciate any help </s>
<s> just in case you may be a real wizard the three drivers that are missing are listed as 1 multimedia audio controller location pci bus 0 device 20 function 5 2 pci device location pci bus 0 device 20 function 0 3 unknown device on microsoft acpi compliant system </s>

<s> i had the same issue on win 2000 try downloading powerdvd trial which has a software decoder built in rather than having to buy a 15 or 30 decoder for windows media player and other software if you can t install the original motherboard and system drivers which you can t because hp doesn t support that on your pavilion i know that because i have the hp a1250n the same family </s>
<s> hp only supports the media center edition they supply and no other drivers </s>
