<s> ok so my computer died a tragic death </s>
<s> they tell me his capacitors blew they expanded to an unnatural volume and started leaking a mysterious red powder </s>
<s> i suspect this is what was causing the comp to endlessly reboot every 40 seconds when i would try and turn it on </s>
<s> after an unsuccessful exorcism i brought the big boy to a more professional computer shop </s>
<s> and they re the ones who told me the motherboard is dead and there s nothing i can do about it </s>
<s> i had just recently bought a 1 gb ram module though and it feels like it would be a shame to let it go to waste </s>
<s> as a bonus buying a computer that uses one of those old rams ddr1 i think he called it will be much cheaper than buying one of those new i5 supercomputers </s>
<s> so i want to transfer my rams safely </s>
<s> ideally i would just swap them from on computer to the next while they are rig next to one another but i don t perfectly trust this computer store </s>
<s> i want to open up the computer i buy and make sure the stick will fit while still in the store </s>
<s> that way i can catch any problems with them right next to me </s>
<s> but how do i that </s>
<s> i only have 1 ram case and i have 2 modules </s>
<s> and it s been raining like crazy in these parts </s>
<s> i m not just going to step outside with the card lying naked in my hand will i </s>
<s> so any tips </s>
<s> there is no ddr1 but it maybe in reference to ddr </s>
<s> there is ddr2 and ddr3 the latter new ram modules </s>
<s> any new to you mtrbd </s>
<s> that uses ddr isn t really the latest mtrbd </s>
<s> out there </s>
<s> your best bet is ddr2 usage and that s not ddr1 </s>
<s> these aren t interchangeable </s>
<s> you re really need to move on but if you find any mtrbd </s>
<s> that uses ddr it will say so via the specs </s>
<s> so review whatever you get and verify that requirement </s>
<s> alas for low cost buying a ddr2 is the better choice but if you need to buy then ddr3 is far better </s>
<s> that choice i leave to you </s>
<s> you can find older mtrbd </s>
<s> as closeouts ebay craigslist etc </s>
<s> in keeping to swap that mtrbd cheap entry new systems are available under 400 if that keeps within your budget </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> you are asking about something widely discussed </s>
<s> in short you ground yourself and pull the parts out </s>
<s> then same for installing </s>
<s> seems like some need more than that quick version </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> r proffitt yes i understand how to insert a card once the computer is already in my house what i am asking is how should i store the ram what kind of container should i use to get it to the store </s>
<s> because right now the only thing i can figure is to use a ziplock or my bare hands i don t trust aluminum paper willy hold on i wrote it down somewhere quot one 512mb ddr400 pc3200u 184 pin ram and one 1gb of the same type quot </s>
<s> that s what was in my old pentium iv when it died </s>
<s> you re saying this type of ram isn t interchangeable </s>
<s> and i wouldn t be able to pop them into a new pentium iv </s>
<s> if i m going to push up to 400 i might as well wait for boxing day and see what deals show up then </s>
<s> if you don t now then you truly need to know what specs your old system was </s>
<s> visit and using your known model or mtrbd </s>
<s> info verify what you have </s>
<s> i m sure that ddr is the end result </s>
<s> you can not swap ddr and ddr2 ram into each other slots beleieve it there is a physical limitation of the actual ram module google for pics </s>
<s> if you find another p4 mtrbd </s>
<s> then again verify if you can re use ddr into its ram slots </s>
<s> this is all explained clearly by the specs of that system mtrbd so be sure what you have </s>
<s> as for your actual ram 512mb and 1gb both being ddr aren t going to be installed in any ddr2 slot period </s>
<s> though if you find a new p4 mtrbd </s>
<s> and ddr ram capable yes the ram can be re used </s>
<s> as for handling any ram re use the anti static bags or material </s>
<s> if none is present the best available substitute use plain copy office paper just keep handling to a minimum and de static esd yourself before handling by grounding to some metal </s>
<s> google for esd characteristics </s>
<s> i hope i made myself clear </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> sorry but plastics unless treated for anti static would be a bad idea </s>
<s> the surface charge on plastics can kill chips </s>
<s> aluminum foil is far better for this </s>
