<s> ddr ram i m having in my pc so graphic card is must ddr </s>
<s> ddr2 or ddr3 can work </s>
<s> you are saying your computer has integrated video but you want a graphics card </s>
<s> your integrated video uses quot shared quot ram which means memory on the motherboard </s>
<s> if you put a dedicated video card in your pc it will have it s own ram and will not share memory from the motherboard </s>
<s> this means it doesn t matter what kind of ram is on the video card you buy </s>
<s> hope that helps </s>
<s> so you ll have to live with this not very fast but still a lot better then what you have now </s>
<s> but it is possible the upgradation in compaq </s>
<s> because i heard that in compaq the chances are very less and i want to ad it 512mb graphic card my ram type is ddr only so in graphic card i needed same ddr or 2 and 3 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 1 i will not write more about how the video card s ram is on it s own card and system so it can be ddr sdram ddr2 3 or other </s>
<s> 2 your pc gt 3 </s>
<s> three pci no agp slot 4 with the limited psu see google i might try this card 5 it s up to you to check for clearances since it has a big heat sink </s>
<s> 6 i bet this machine may need the cover left off to avoid overheating with this </s>
