<s> i bought this video card nvidia geforce4 mx 420 for my computer to support all my pc games </s>
<s> i have never had a problem until now </s>
<s> when i installed call of duty 2 i got an error message that my video card did not support alpha blending which was strange to me because i have two other call of duty games as well as many other pc games that never gave me a problem </s>
<s> i looked at the nvidia web site to see about downloading an update but i m nervous about picking the correct one </s>
<s> can anybody tell me which download is the right one </s>
<s> the nvidia drivers are quite nice and won t install unless they work with your card and os </s>
<s> you can t go wrong </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob i downloaded the driver and while the game can now be played my regular display setting are distractingly massive </s>
<s> how can i get my display desktop picture icon size and internet display etc </s>
<s> to be the same size as before </s>
<s> if i use system restore will it take out the newly downloaded driver </s>
<s> is there another way to change the display </s>
<s> some of the page is so far off the screen that i can t even get to the arrow to move it across the page </s>
<s> sue </s>
<s> remember that i m going to take everyone as being familiar with how to change the desktop properties and set them to their favorite 800x600 or 1024x768 pixels or such </s>
<s> tell me which you used </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> found it 1280 x 960 thanks </s>
