<s> i have a computer running win me </s>
<s> i want to transfer the files from that hard drive to a computer running win 2000 is it possable to take the hd from the me computer and put it in the 2000 computer as a 2nd drive </s>
<s> i would then copy the files to the drive that has 2000 installed on it </s>
<s> i would then put the me drive back in the computer that it was in first </s>
<s> will all the programs work ok </s>
<s> by transfer do you mean move them or just copy them </s>
<s> you can certainly put a second drive in another pc temporarily for this purpose </s>
<s> you cannot copy entire programs this way but you can copy such as text audio video picture files and those you have created with programs on the other pc </s>
<s> the other pc must have the ability to open the files you copied or they would be of little value </s>
<s> hope this answers your question </s>
<s> i think i get the idea </s>
<s> if i install the programs on the win 2000 computer i can copy the data for those programs from the second hd </s>
<s> next question </s>
<s> if i leave the hd from the win me computer in win 2000 computer will win 2000 be able to run those programs </s>
<s> the me hd would be a slave </s>
<s> how much of win me could i delete from the hd </s>
<s> you cannot link program shortcuts from one drive to another as the programs are installed and registered to the os on the drive </s>
<s> however you can install both completely working drives and run them independently by switching through the bios when you start or restart the pc </s>
<s> i do this myself </s>
<s> if you plug your me drive into one already working with win2k you will need to configure the hardware load the necessary drivers etc </s>
<s> once done you can select which drive to operate from </s>
<s> i prefer this to partitioning and loading multiple oss on a single drive </s>
