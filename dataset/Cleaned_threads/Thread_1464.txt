<s> hello all yeterday i bought a thoshiba store art 3 1tb external hard drive </s>
<s> it had some drivers inside 200mb and when i checked the available space it was showning 931gb </s>
<s> i checked with the vendor and he said quot the acutul and the available capacities are always different and moreover it is having some space reserved for backup quot </s>
<s> i do not have the access to the 1024 931 93gbs and the moment and i feel confused </s>
<s> i can see two partitions dev sdb and dev sdb1 but only one is accessible to me </s>
<s> also i am using fedora 13 and the speed i am getting is 1mb s which is very low </s>
<s> pls advice thanks in advance adarsh </s>
<s> seems ok there are 2 definitions of gb </s>
<s> they differ by 7 </s>
<s> when selling a disk generally the one giving the largest number is used </s>
<s> in the os usually the other </s>
<s> nothing wrong with that </s>
<s> don t know why it s so slow unless it s connected to a usb 1 port </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> hi can you please clarify in quot there are 2 definitions of gb quot </s>
<s> also is thoshiba the one holding the most space than other manufacturers </s>
<s> if yes who is the most efficient </s>
<s> is 7 a standard rate </s>
<s> we have decimal bytes and binary bytes </s>
<s> a megaton is one million tons </s>
<s> a computer megabyte is 1048576 we re nearly 5 per cent off already </s>
<s> imagine if you converted 1 billion bytes to terabytes </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hd makers rate capacity based on one k byte equals 1000 bytes </s>
<s> an os such as windows rates capacity based on one k byte equals 1024 bytes </s>
<s> if you think about that for a moment and then get out paper and pencil and expand it to one t byte a whole bunch of space is going to vanish </s>
<s> already tried and sobbed about the 90 gbs </s>
<s> if it is a case of 1000mb to 1gb then it around 7 </s>
<s> you are right </s>
<s> but still searching for a way to make it faster </s>
<s> on windows i get 55kb s </s>
<s> in linux it literally slept but will find a way for sure </s>
<s> for example the host pc make model where connected </s>
<s> so here it is some front usb ports fall back to usb 1 0 speed and while it is well discussed why after years i found one person to fix it </s>
<s> this means my advice is to use the rear ports </s>
<s> but without make and model how can i give that advice </s>
<s> about fedora </s>
<s> nice but i d try ubuntu next </s>
<s> i find its hardware support to be a little better </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it is a vaio vpceb12en </s>
<s> it does not have usb ports on the back but three on the right side and one usb esata port on left whcih can also used as a usb port i did not try on that one </s>
<s> and also with windows i can see the transfer rate upto 57mb s with the ports on the right </s>
<s> yes i agree with that </s>
<s> ubuntu has better support and also easy too than fedora </s>
<s> but i love fedora </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> site forums fedoraforum org fedora sony slow usb on google finds folk talking about that </s>
<s> sorry but i don t write on work on fedora just some embedded linux so let s let fedora folk address that os </s>
<s> seems to echo your post here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> that is my post only </s>
<s> posted it yesterday </s>
<s> i am afraid it is not a problem with sony because i am getting reasonably good speed while on windows </s>
<s> seems like some driver issue in fedora </s>
