<s> hey all lately i ve noticed a very weird problem on my monitors </s>
<s> i have random pixels that are strangely coloured all around the screen things are still visible </s>
<s> i am fairly sure it isn t dead pixels as my main monitor is very new and when i play my xbox 360 through it it doesnt seem to occur i have uninstalled and reinstalled different video drivers and it has had no affect </s>
<s> my specs are as follows xp sp2 evga nvidia 7900gt ko acer 22 widescreen and if you need any other specs dont mind asking </s>
<s> since your card is factory oc d you might want to dial it back a bit </s>
<s> use atitool works with nvidia cards also to test your video memory and see if its causing the problem </s>
<s> so it would seem that my problem has gotten worse now my computer is crashing in some instances it seems to be triggered by gpu usage </s>
<s> some videos i open will suddenly stop and the computer freezes then crashes </s>
<s> i crashed while running a test in atitool and it also says i have high amounts of artifacting is there anything other then buying a new card that i can do or </s>
<s> you should definitely dial back your gpu core and memory to stock settings and try it again </s>
<s> also check you gpu fan to ensure it s spinning properly </s>
