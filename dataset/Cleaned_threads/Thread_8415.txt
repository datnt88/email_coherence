<s> for the past 2 mornings when first getting on my computer it is showing 54 cpu usage with nothing open </s>
<s> i leave my computer one all the time i go into task manager and it shows msmsgs exe internet explorer and lucallback exe running </s>
<s> i googled the lucallback exe which i didn t undersatnd as it says something about a proxy and also auto updates </s>
<s> my computer is set for auto updates but the time is set for 2 30 am it is 6 30 when i get on my computer </s>
<s> the time and date are correct in the control panel </s>
<s> when i do a re start it says that msmsgs exe and explorer needs to close </s>
<s> i end the program restart and everything is back to normal with the processor runnning between 1 and 4 </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks wayne </s>
<s> quot lucallback exe quot is i believe norton s quot live update quot utility which is not the same as windows updates </s>
<s> as for msmsgs exe are you leaving windows messenger running the background </s>
<s> if so it may be doing various pings among other things to see if you are still connected which icon to show etc </s>
<s> since some have time thresholds of like quot after 15 minutes of idle show away quot message </s>
<s> internet explorer is a world unto itself i think in terms of its cpu and memory usage at times though it could be worth noting which version you use and if there are updates or enhancements for it </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> yes windows messenger was running so i turned it off in gpedit msc </s>
<s> i am also using norton anti virus so i turned off the auto updates feature there and will just do it manually </s>
<s> i keep reading that a persons computer can be used as a zombie computer so that is why i was concerned </s>
<s> i had never seen this before </s>
<s> thanks again and i will keep an eye on it for the next couple days </s>
<s> wayne </s>
