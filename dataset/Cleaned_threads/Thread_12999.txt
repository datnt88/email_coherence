<s> sorry in advance for the length i couldn t really think of a good title to describe my problem but that s as good as it could be i guess </s>
<s> anyway i ve been doing a great deal of work on the hardware for my computer this summer but i ve been as careful as i can be </s>
<s> the problems started around when i added a modem and installed sp2 for winxp </s>
<s> i turn the computer on and at some point it decides it doesn t want to work anymore </s>
<s> then it just freezes up and i cannot do anything except reset which sometimes doesn t work until i disconnect the power wait till it all drains out then plug it back up and set to work </s>
<s> it s not the hard drive because i put in a brand new hard drive and besides it even locks up in bios sometimes </s>
<s> various things make me think it might be the power supply but then again i don t know i still am learning about computer hardware </s>
<s> specs psu antec 300w mb intel processor intel p4 i think 1 8 ghz ram kingston dimm </s>
<s> 256 mb pci audio astron ensoniq audiopci not sure says all three agp video some sort of agp card with added s video support don t seem any names case it says mb on the front </s>
<s> hdd western digital 200 gb dvd lite on dvd rw cd lg cd rw i also added an extra fan </s>
<s> any clue what could be up with this </s>
<s> also what s up with the 20 pin and 4 pin connectors that plug into the motherboard from the psu </s>
<s> i ve seen 20 pin connectors as well as 24 but never 20 4 two separate connections </s>
<s> thanks g day </s>
<s> christopher </s>
<s> could be spyware adware etc </s>
<s> another reason would be the low amount of ram </s>
<s> the power cable you mean thye 4 pin connector that plugs into newer mobos </s>
<s> not sure if yours needs that and you understand about 24 pin cables </s>
<s> i would highly recommend updating your drivers video and sound as that s where most problems begin </s>
<s> what s your paging size set at </s>
<s> i would upgrade ram but xp can be used on 256mb </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> gt gt spyware adware gt no i forgot to mention it was even with a new installation of windows and then again with a brand new hard drive </s>
<s> gt gt power source 4 pin etc gt my pc has a 300 watt power supply with a 20 pin plus a 4 pin connector for the motherboard </s>
<s> gt gt updating drivers paging size ram gt well the thing is it sometimes even locks up in the bios as it gets ready to boot into windows </s>
<s> anyway i think the problem is most likely either in the motherboard or the power supply but i haven t another power supply that has the 20 4 so i can t try that </s>
<s> any other suggestions thanks for those who have tried to help so far </s>
<s> well i tested the power supply the other day and it ran fine as well as the computer </s>
<s> so the power supply works fine now i am thinking it is perhaps the motherboard or maybe the ram causing the pc to lock up </s>
<s> any suggestions on this </s>
