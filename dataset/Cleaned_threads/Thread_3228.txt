<s> i just got an hp pavillion a1510n still not sure of what to think of it yet </s>
<s> i was told it is compatible for all the new software coming up like windows vista then of course i didnt have a computer at the time to confirm anything considering i needed the internet to do that </s>
<s> so if anyone knows how this model of computer will do in the future let me know </s>
<s> and ill take any suggestions and opinions on what would be a good investment to boost my computer performance </s>
<s> such as graphic cards ect </s>
<s> ect </s>
<s> these two links should provide you an answer use and verify for vista readiness </s>
<s> tada willy this opinion is mine and no political party supports it </s>
<s> ok thanx theres something that comes up saying i need to download a utility thing to take the test </s>
<s> but when i need to know and have the money for vista ill know where to go </s>
<s> thanx again </s>
<s> yeah d l the sit its not intrusive </s>
<s> it will check your system and compare it to what vista needs </s>
<s> understand also that vista will come in various flavours and need a minium to run for its most basic release as more bells whistles are added sure it needs more </s>
<s> as in oses before it i don t doubt that vista when openly sold will run its own tests and see if it can be installed thus the last test before installing for sure </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> ok ill d l that stuff then and see how it gos thanx </s>
