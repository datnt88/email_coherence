<s> i m trying to decide between two different systems but can t come to a decision </s>
<s> i was hoping someone here with more knowledge could help me decide </s>
<s> the first system an hp m7330n is the cheaper of the two </s>
<s> i haven t been able to find out much about the system but it does seem decent for the price </s>
<s> right now all i m worried about it a decent media center pc </s>
<s> the second computer is a dell dimension 5150 this is about 200 dollars more expensive but it comes with dual tv tuners a feature that s important and one the hp lacks and i m used to going with dell computers </s>
<s> couple of factors that are holding me back the tv tuners dell i really want the amd 64 x2 hp and i hear that hp computers suck even moreso if you want to add and expand in the future </s>
<s> but still the price of the hp is looking really good to me </s>
<s> can anyone here give me any ideas </s>
<s> i don t really play games on the computer but i intend to more often sims 2 the movies half life 2 </s>
<s> just a few games really and i m not worried about having the visuals maxed out </s>
<s> i just photoshop and watch tv </s>
<s> sorry if this is a bother </s>
<s> imho the hp 7330n is a better and faster system which probably has only two drawbacks for your stated use </s>
<s> one is the lack of dual tuners </s>
<s> you can fix that either by an external usb tuner or a ati all in wonder card such as x800 or x1600 </s>
<s> two is the integrated x200 radeon graphics </s>
<s> that is resolvable by using the above aiw or a card such as nvidia s 6800gs or better </s>
<s> any faster card would require that you upgrade the pwer supply too the biggest advantages over the dell are the x2 4200 vs the p4 3 0 and the much bigger hard drive </s>
<s> plus that the 5150 is discontinued in favor of the e510 series </s>
<s> your reply is muchly appreciated </s>
<s> on the canadian dell website the 5150 is still available so i had no idea it was discontinued </s>
<s> i checked the american site and sure enough it s not there </s>
<s> i m really glad you pointed this out to me </s>
<s> so with the all in wonder i ll be able to record one show and watch another </s>
<s> that would be great but like you said i d have to upgrade the power suply </s>
<s> only problem i hear that s hard to do if you don t use hp products the style and size of the casing </s>
<s> if you went with the x1600 x1800 or new x1900 aiw s you would have to replace it my hp 1250n has a 300 w ps which works fine with a 6800gs but i wouldn t try higher than that 7800 x1800 s require like 450w ps </s>
<s> the x800 aiw shouldn t need a ps upgrade but it couldn t hurt </s>
<s> i just wouldn t want a card that old when newer ones aren t much more expensive </s>
<s> i believe you can watch one and record another but i haven t tried it yet no tuner yet on my media center pc lol </s>
<s> as far as the ps upgrade itself hp uses more standard sized ps unlike dell which is notorious for customized ps setups try a standard ps and watch your mb fry </s>
