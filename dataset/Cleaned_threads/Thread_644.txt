<s> hello i just bought an external hard and plan to reformat it to ntfs </s>
<s> i have a pc with windows 2000 and a laptop with xp pro that i will use it with </s>
<s> i will also take it over to a friend s house to transfer some music from his collection </s>
<s> i believe that his external hard drive is formatted to fat32 </s>
<s> might be an ignorant question but will i be able to take files off of his fat32 formatted external hard drive and transfer them to my ntfs formatted drive </s>
<s> in addition if he has data stored on his windows me pc that i want i am assuming that i cannot take it since my drive is ntfs </s>
<s> is that correct </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help </s>
<s> but more to the point for usb file system support your windows 2000 works fine with fat32 and ntfs </s>
<s> windows me will only support fat32 and the other fats </s>

<s> ok i understand </s>
<s> so no issue with getting the files from his fat external drive but i won t be able to plug into his me pc right </s>
<s> can i plug my ntfs drive into windows me </s>
<s> sure but it won t be recognised </s>
<s> for that direction of transfer use some fat32 volume </s>
<s> please eject said drives proper since fat32 drives are well known to corrupt or vanish if we lose power or pull the plug </s>

<s> what i meant </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
