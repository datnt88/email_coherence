<s> i want to buy a pentium 3 on newegg but they only have them oem </s>
<s> what does this mean </s>
<s> does it at least come with the instructions </s>
<s> the site says processor only </s>
<s> the p3 has been out of production for years now </s>
<s> but to answer your question it will be just the chip and nothing else it s mainly for those that need to fix a machine so no instructions but look on the web </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob is correct but you need to know if the processor is a coppermine or tualatin core and which your motherboard can support </s>
<s> tualatins were late entries as the p4 release was imminent as i recall so older socket 370 boards did not support it </s>
<s> btw oem means quot original equipment manufacturer quot which means these are the components pc builders buy in bulk and get a better deal </s>
<s> you don t get the boxed products warranty from intel and you do not get a fan heatsink </s>
<s> hope that adds some helpful info </s>
<s> does it at least come with instructions </s>
<s> what instructions are needed </s>
<s> ask here since many forum members have replaced a p3 cpu </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> making the cpu work and operate at it s potential is dependant on the mb more than anything else </s>
<s> you must insert it properly and cool it </s>
<s> these are quot keyed quot so you just about can t put it in wrong </s>
<s> you will need to find an adequate fan and heat sink </s>
<s> these are readily available and p3s don t produce the heat p4s do </s>
<s> the fan will probably plug into a mb near the cpu socket </s>
<s> you may have to set jumpers or core voltages but most modern mbs are jumper free and can autodetect the cpu and configure it </s>
<s> you should have a mb manual handy and the web site of the manufacturer is usually a good source for these </s>
