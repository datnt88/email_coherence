<s> graphics card p gpid 280 i want to find out if i can connect the computer to an old tv via the graphics card s dvi i port </s>
<s> does the the dvi port support a component b dvi i rgb </s>
<s> if yes to a and or b the tv is old 10 years or more </s>
<s> it has 2 scart ports </s>
<s> how do i determine whether the scart ports support a component b dvi i rgb </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i remember scart has a max resolution of 576i so there is so little gain that i ll just write don t bother </s>

<s> i don t understand your answer </s>
<s> so little gain compared to what </s>
<s> i don t want to know whether the tv can be a replacement for a computer monitor </s>
<s> from an older computer that had tv out i know that the reso lution supported is to low for that purpose </s>
<s> but for watching movies and videos is was sufficient 800x600 </s>
<s> and that is my question can i use the dvi port to connect to the tv scart port and by that obtain the above purpose </s>
<s> still thanks for your effort </s>
<s> let s find a dvi to scart cable </s>
<s> but no one i know can verify if it works </s>
<s> a quick search finds no such cable which verifies that you ll have to stick with known solutions like s video to scart </s>
