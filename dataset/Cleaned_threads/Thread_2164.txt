<s> when i first got my hp pavilion it worked like a charm </s>
<s> i installed norton 360 and soon after that little things started to happen </s>
<s> finally the computer started to reboot at what seemed random times </s>
<s> i had the computer checked out by a professional who was only able to slightly improve the computer s performance </s>
<s> he took out norton 360 claiming that it was damaging some parts of the operating system windows xp entertainment edition </s>
<s> i really don t want to reinstall the operating system as i have installed some free software that is no longer available </s>
<s> lately when i try to turn off the computer via run etc the computer reboots </s>
<s> i have to resort to turning off the computer via front panel switch </s>
<s> i use the computer for work and don t really want to have much down time </s>
<s> any help i can get in this regard will be most appreciated </s>
<s> thank you </s>
