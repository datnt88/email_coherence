<s> i already know it makes it more accurate but before i blow a hundred dollars on a mouse i want to know if it actually makes the game look smoother </s>
<s> i just bought a new graphics card gtx 560 ti and couldn t help but notice that it looks a little jumpy when i slide the mouse </s>
<s> when i run or aim i can tell that the games actually running a lot smoother than when i turn </s>
<s> it also looks a lot smoother with a controller </s>
<s> so can somebody vouch that their games got smoother looking after buying a higher dpi mouse or is it just one of those things people like to brag about but it reality there s no difference </s>
<s> it should </s>
<s> a mouse uses quot dpi rating quot in that it transverses the display it also counts on dpi to makes it movements </s>
<s> if not capable it will appear jerky or snappy trying to catch up </s>
<s> also since you have a better video grade you raise the level as all that follows must also be capable and or measure up </s>
<s> this is not normally a problem but if you push the bounds then expect it to push back because everything is suspect to an upgrade </s>
<s> what makes a 100 mouse now you know and it may not always appear that way </s>
<s> at the same time if the mouse needs extra attention it may suck some cpu cycles when you may need them for game play then i m not a gamer </s>
<s> though i fix many a gamer pc only because they push them to the limits with a mix match of pc parts for what was the deal of the day purchase </s>
<s> no downplay on gamers but if you want the best from your pc then install the best into your pc </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> yeah it looks like it does </s>
<s> i borrowed a wired optical mouse from a friend that was less than 2000 dpi just to test things out </s>
<s> before i used a wireless mouse because i m using it on a tv and across the room </s>
<s> it improved the performance about a thousand times </s>
<s> i ve already ordered a logitech g700 5700 dpi and hopefully it won t fail me because it s wireless as well </s>
