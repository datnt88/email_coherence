<s> hi everyone good day </s>
<s> i 2 have 3com 5500g switch and i installed new transceiver which is 1000base lx sfp 3csfp92 </s>
<s> how many lc connector do i need to buy </s>
<s> is it recommended to have 2 for transmitter and receiver or it is being fused </s>
<s> please guide me </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> not sure what you are asking </s>
<s> you can only plug a single cable into each sfp </s>
<s> it has 1 strand for transmit and 1 strand for receive </s>
<s> you want to cross transmit to receive most cables you can very carefully swap the pair at the end </s>
<s> what you need is a dual strand lc lc cable the proper length </s>
<s> i assume even though you have lx sfp you are going a short distance so you can use multimode cable </s>
<s> if your question is do you buy 4 sfp and run 2 connections between the switches for redundancy then you get even more questions since you must have configurations to allow for it </s>
<s> if you are running a fiber within a building it is very unlikely it will ever fail </s>
<s> the failure for fiber is that someone physically breaks it </s>
<s> when you look at fiber redundancy you must run the fibers in different paths since things that break 1 fiber tend to break all at the same time </s>
<s> ok rereading i see what you are asking </s>
<s> you can buy 2 single strand cables but it is a pain </s>
<s> buy what you call a fused cable which is called dual strand in most sites </s>
<s> the ends can be unsnapped and swapped very easy if the orientation is not correct generally most companies they are crossed on short cables just like you need </s>
