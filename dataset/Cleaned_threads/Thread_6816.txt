<s> hi all ok i bought an ati sapphire radeon 9250 td 128mb </s>
<s> i have an abit k7 mobo </s>
<s> 128mb ram 800mh amd athlon using winxp pro </s>
<s> i used to have an nvidia 64mb riva tnt2 64 64pro and everything worked fine so long as the games were old </s>
<s> ask me for any other specs </s>
<s> ok ive turned off and deleted drivers of the previous hardware acceleration put in the new card correctly </s>
<s> booted on a clean install of windows run the installer using catalyst 5 2 or whatever is latest software interface and drivers but as soon as the drivers are loaded the screen turns black with blinking underscore in the top left hand corner </s>
<s> so later i run in diagnostic mode turn off accelaration and the problem goes away so i can get a basic display but i cant use acceleration </s>
<s> also when running without acceleration catalyst errors and cannot start with mention about there not being a ati card present or its working drivers i would really like to start playing games at my friends pace is there anyone who can help </s>
<s> well have tried youir method and found the same results </s>
<s> give this a try right click on the desktop and then click properties </s>
<s> this should bring up display properties and from there you need to need to click on the settings tab </s>
<s> now in the setting folder look for and click on the advance tab </s>
<s> once this opens a new window look for adaptor tab and click it </s>
<s> now you will need to look for some thing listed as the display adaptor and there should be a properties button for said </s>
<s> click on this and look for drivers tab when you find this look for update driver click there and point it in the direction of your drivers </s>
<s> let us know if htis helps </s>
<s> since your card is from an ati quot partner quot and not ati did you get your drivers from sapphire </s>
<s> if not get the equivalent from their site </s>
<s> first off your new card will run the catalyst drivers found on ati s website </s>
<s> all their partner cards use standard ati drivers </s>
<s> did you say you were running winxp pro and trying to play games on 128 megs of ram </s>
<s> if so then i think we ve found your problem </s>
<s> winxp home and pro both use around 128 megs sitting still doing nothing at all and you are trying to play a game on top of that </s>
<s> yes i know gateway dell and all the other cookie cutter computer retailers will sell a pc with xp and 128 megs but ask any gamer what happens and you ll soon find that it s simply not enough </s>
<s> video cards can render over 120 frames per second these days and you didn t think that all that was happening on the video cards 128 or 256 meg memory did you </s>
<s> part of that action is happening in your system memory </s>
<s> heck a gig of corsair xms extreme low latency memory 2 2 2 5 with activity led s is only around 270 bucks these days so live a little and shell out a couple dollars </s>
<s> i d lay money on it that your problems will disapear and your games will be better than ever </s>
<s> you ll also free up that new video card s memory so it can render to it s heart s content </s>
<s> you will most certainly notice that your lag suddenly diminishes or goes away </s>
<s> even if you don t want to spend that much money i m sure you can break open a piggy bank and get at least a 256mb chip </s>
<s> well the only time i can reach that area is if there are no drivers other than the basic vga </s>
<s> if the driver for the card and the card itself are installed and detected at boot the screen goes black etc </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i didnt want to have to spend anymore </s>
<s> but this seems the most likely cause </s>
<s> ill go shopping soon enough </s>
<s> john in the next message answers this question </s>
<s> i concur due to having already looked at the sapphire site the cards uses the same software catalyst 5 2 </s>
