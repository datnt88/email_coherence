<s> hello i have been trying to play games like call of duty 2 and doom 3 and they run really slow and choppy </s>
<s> i took this system requirements test and my graphics card was the only thing that failed the test </s>
<s> so my question is if i want to upgrade a graphics card can i just upgrade to any graphics card or does it matter what my pc specs are </s>
<s> i have a pentium 4 3 06 ghz 896 ram 146 gb hard drive ati radeon express 200 and i have a pci express slot </s>
<s> get a card with as much ram as you can afford and make sure it ll fit is designed for pci express </s>
<s> do you have an agp slot </s>
<s> if so maybe a better choice </s>
<s> but just because it has more doesn t mean it s better </s>
<s> the memory interface is just as important if not more </s>
<s> for example my system came with a 7300le turbocache card listed as 256mb </s>
<s> it was configured to use 512mb 64bit memory interface </s>
<s> most half decent cards now are true 256mb cards with a 128bit memory interface </s>
<s> the higher end cards are 256mb with 256bit memory interfaces </s>
<s> quot the best gaming video cards for the money may 2007 quot quot vga charts 2007 quot note that those reviews and charts don t have the latest nvidia geforce 88xx cards or ati radeon 2xxx cards </s>
