<s> does anyone know a site that can tell me how to set up a wireless network with two different operating systems </s>
<s> please be specific give a link or something don t just say look around cnet </s>
<s> for example here is a linux based wap </s>
<s> since windows is covered widely i didn t supply a link </s>
<s> there are many too many articles about this </s>
<s> the killer item however is that in linux many fail to research if there is support for their card </s>
<s> that tends to be the issue bob </s>
<s> thanks fo the link but what i need is a good thoruogh informative link for networking for windows </s>
<s> all of the sites i have seen so far have only talked about networking with xp </s>
<s> i m trying to network two computers </s>
<s> one has windwos 2000 and one has xp </s>
<s> you don t have a wap </s>
<s> yes this is rarely covered but you missed it since it s called by another name </s>
<s> gt it s called adhoc networking </s>
<s> i never had to consult any documentation to set that up </s>
<s> i set the adapters to adhoc mode and waited </s>
<s> too easy and maybe why it s not covered widely </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if wap is a wireless access point i have a wireless router d link di 624 </s>
<s> the router is wired to the dsl modem and my pc </s>
<s> my laptop has an atheros ar5001x wireless network adapter </s>
<s> the problem is that on both the pc and the laptop when i try to dial into the internet enternet says there was no response from the remote computer </s>
<s> as well although i m pretty sure the computers are connected i can t get them to share printers or files </s>
<s> eveything i ve read on networking so far has either been for windows 98 or xp never for 2000 i m sure it will be pretty easy to enable file and printer sharing but my bigger problem is the internet </s>
<s> if know a way to fix this let me know but if you know any good sites that could help that would be fine </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> why are you doling out the details </s>
<s> i ve guessed wrong 2 times now and given your useless information </s>
<s> sorry about that but it could explain why you are finding it difficult to find help </s>
<s> in closing it seems you have a normal setup </s>
<s> in that case just read what came with the router </s>
<s> nothing is out of the ordinary so i bid you well and write that your setup has thousands of web sites of help </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> all i want is a good site </s>
<s> if there are thousands of sites that address my issue can t you give me a one or two </s>
<s> i haven t found any for networking windows 2000 to xp </s>
<s> 99 99 of the time set the tcpip settings in xp and 2000 to dhcp then plug them into the dlink router </s>
<s> bingo </s>
<s> they are now networked </s>
<s> you have yet to reveal what networking feature is not working or if you can t share files or more </s>
<s> i can t guess what step is eluding you </s>
<s> you may have done something like installed a firewall and didn t allow filesharing but this is yet to be revealed </s>
<s> please take time to tell more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> and click on the product manual link </s>
<s> follow the directions </s>
<s> so far nothing shared here reveals anything other than a stock setup </s>
<s> cheers bob </s>
<s> my problems are that i can t connect to my dsl connection i might be picking up the neighbours broadband connection and i can t file and print share </s>
<s> as well when i created a netsetup file with the network setup wizard on my windows xp laptop my windows 2000 computer told me that netsetup was not compatible with windows 2000 however i finally got windows xp so i m going to install that and then reset the router </s>
<s> hopefully then i will be able to set up the network </s>
<s> thanks for your help anyways </s>
