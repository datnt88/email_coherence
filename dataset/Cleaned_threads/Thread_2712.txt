<s> img img this morning i turned on my pc all of a suddend i hear a horrifying roaring noise coming out of my pc chasis eeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrr faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa huuuummm_huuuummm_huuummmm_huuummmm after a while i noticed the noise is starting to fade away more and more as seconds passes by when windows finished booting i could barely hear it after 5 mins the noise is completely gone </s>
<s> but i m so very worried </s>
<s> i live in hong kong it s been raining all week and there are alot of mouisures in the air not to mention alot of flies and insects flying around and i didn t turn on my pc for at least 3 days so i was wondering if any of the above faactors cause this noise or if it s something much worst </s>
<s> i checked my 2 chasis fans they re spinning i m sure there s nothing clogging them though that s all i know and so my main concerns are what are the noises </s>
<s> are the electricity frying my motherboard </s>
<s> if a bug got insde my pc and i turn my pc on will the whole pc fry up </s>
<s> there was a thunder strike this morning but i turned on my pc after the thunder strike has ended but still does this have to do with anything </s>
<s> please answer all my question </s>
<s> this is an emergency please help me please i beg you please help me </s>
<s> t_t thanks for the help </s>
<s> sounds like the bearings in one of the fans has gone try stopping 1 fan and see if it goes away then trie the other if so just replace the fan </s>
<s> what do you mean when you say quot bearings in one of the fans has gone try quot i didn t understand what you just said so would you please be so kind as to explain a little bit more </s>
<s> and you also advise me to stop one of the fans or something i don t quite understand that either so please explain more </s>
<s> thanks for all the help t_t </s>
<s> i think what he was trying to say is you have several fans in your case </s>
<s> you could have one or two chassis fans a fan for the cpu and one or two in the power supply </s>
<s> what you are describing is a sign that the bearings in a fan are broken </s>
<s> try uplugging one fan at a time while the computer is off and boot the computer </s>
<s> if the noise remains shut down the computer plug the disconnected fan back up </s>
<s> disconnect another fan and retry </s>
<s> if you are to do this with your cpu fan do not boot up for long as it can overheat your cpu </s>
<s> it may also be that you have a cable that is touching the fan blades heard the same sound from that situation before hope this helps </s>
<s> i would say to leave the computer off in a storm just incase but you should check inside the computer for dust </s>
<s> try to get as much dust out of the computer as you can an air can is really good for this </s>
<s> dust can heat up the computer a lot but acting like a blanket on the motherboard </s>
<s> it can also get on wires and create a connection to make a spark and fry the motherboard </s>
<s> already asked verbatim and answered on 30th may 2006 </s>
<s> that s quite a long morning by anyone s clock </s>
