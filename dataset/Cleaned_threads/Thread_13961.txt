<s> forgive me i tried to search for a solution for this issue but it s really hard to nail down the search parameters </s>
<s> i ll explain the situation and maybe you can appreciate my difficulty </s>
<s> i have a thermaltake matrix tower which houses a pc that i built 100 </s>
<s> my issue is that often when i push the case s power button power on i get the power led for a split second then it goes dark and the pc will not power up </s>
<s> no matter how many times i push the button the machine is utterly dead with no lights no fans no power </s>
<s> i have to flip the power supply s quot rocker quot power switch off for 5 10 seconds </s>
<s> that usually allows the pc to power up normally </s>
<s> sometimes it does not </s>
<s> i end up killing the rocker switch and pulling the power cord for 10 seconds in that case </s>
<s> i have never failed to get the system to boot but it is a hassle and i ll gladly replace whatever hardware is causing this </s>
<s> there s more to the story this has gone on since very early on </s>
<s> since i noticed this issue i have gradually replaced the hard drive motherboard and cpu </s>
<s> i have swapped out the ide dvd drive for a sata dvd drive </s>
<s> i have had various different os xp vista w7 during the time i have had this ongoing issue </s>
<s> note i did not replace any of those items due to the power up issue simply as performance upgrades </s>
<s> the only thing that hasn t changed is the case ram and power supply </s>
<s> so it s gotta be one of the three </s>
<s> i already have a brand new case and want to transfer the existing mobo and hardware into it </s>
<s> but i ll still have the same old ram and power supply </s>
<s> what are the odds that this issue is with the case </s>
<s> i know 100 for a fact that it isn t my bios </s>
<s> i ve easily had more than 4 different bios with this recurring issue </s>
<s> i m a bit reluctant to go through the transfer to a new case if this issue is with one of the other 2 items </s>
<s> i rather like my psu and it has truly powered my system flawless unless it s the culprit of this current mess </s>
<s> ram could be easily and gladly replaced but i don t actually need different ram </s>
<s> to make clear i m having zero other issues </s>
<s> just this one nagging thing </s>
<s> and it seems to be getting progressively worse </s>
<s> i ve seen something like this once before but it wasn t nearly as chronic </s>
<s> a pc where i worked would need it s cord pulled about once every 6 months in order for it to power up </s>
<s> so guys what do ya think </s>
<s> is it the power supply </s>
<s> the ram </s>
<s> or the case </s>
<s> i used to have issues with the pc suddenly shutting off completely with no warning but i replaced the ups and that has never happened again since </s>
<s> oh yeah i forgot to mention that </s>
<s> i ve replaced the ups too </s>
<s> so surely someone out there has heard of this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you didn t supply full details of your system </s>
<s> what wattage psu amount of ram etc </s>
<s> age of mtrbd </s>
<s> the whole 9 yds we can only guess and even then it could be anything when it comes to such issues </s>
<s> my preference has always been to swap out the psu for a higher wattage unit </s>
<s> on top of that since its a reoccurring problem you need to recheck your work from day 1 i ll say it in simple terms quot don t take anything for granted quot </s>
<s> use ram tester memtest86 google for it </s>
<s> next sometimes reducing the system to the simplest it can be may help </s>
<s> if you doubt the case then a teardown and check all cables etc and see if that s an issue to include mounting brackets posts proper grounding you name it has to be checked </s>
<s> there s also the chance of a bad mtrbd </s>
<s> to include the infamous quot bad caps quot issue google for it </s>
<s> then there s the outyside chance there was damage due to heat stress </s>
<s> the damage is already done but it works now and then until final failure </s>
<s> a power leg of the psu could be lacking better psu or less power demands </s>
<s> cheap or old components that finally start to show why they re cheap it happens </s>
<s> a mismatch of components dragging out ram into new system where its being pushed or if you ve oc ed it reaches a breaking point </s>
<s> i ll leave it at that come back with results </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> it s the first thing i thought when you described your symptoms </s>
<s> it s probably being overloaded </s>
<s> if you watch the fans you ll probably see them twitch a bit and stop when you press the power button </s>
<s> you could try disconnecting hard drives cd roms etc </s>
<s> to see if it will try to boot up as far as the bios </s>
<s> if it does it s too weak for the load it s connected to </s>
<s> 1 bad caps google to learn how to inspect for that </s>
<s> 2 bios cmos battery </s>
<s> use a volt meter to see if it s good </s>
<s> having said that i had a cranky machine for years and in the end we found out it was the motherboard </s>
<s> we lucked into a clone exact machine match that had the same motherboard </s>
<s> swapped motherboards and the new </s>
<s> machine started everytime </s>
<s> go figure </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> you guys didn t read my post </s>
<s> this happened with two completely different motherboards </s>
<s> i stated this clearly </s>
<s> so quot bad caps quot is out </s>
<s> since there has been no other power related issues i do not believe it is the psu </s>
<s> since there are no other issues whatsoever i doubt it s the ram </s>
<s> i regularly put my machine under heavy use modern video gaming and hd audio video rendering </s>
<s> i never never have any problems outside of normal expected software quirks </s>
<s> i m going to go ahead and transfer my rig into the new case </s>
<s> i m guessing the issue is with the power switch on the case </s>
<s> i talked with a buddy since posting this </s>
<s> he s heard of such </s>
<s> bad switch on chassis </s>
<s> will send people away from you </s>
<s> try to remember these are member to member discussions </s>
<s> let s say it is the switch </s>
<s> that s easy to swap </s>
<s> the most common is to use the reset button for the power button as a test </s>
<s> and no case swapping required </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i read it thoroughly and never would have tried such as a motherboard first </s>
<s> in fact i d have done other troubleshooting than just swapping parts or quot shotgunning quot </s>
<s> look up something called the quot half split quot method if that s still taught </s>
<s> you d be well off not to reply back with such insults </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> and reading other responses including yours if you have a new case then why not try that first what can it hurt and it won t cost you anything </s>
<s> second i tend to lean towards the psu quot this has gone on since very early on quot a psu can crap out at anytime try unplugging all the components except the mobo see if the mobo heatsink boots should hear error beeps then plug in components one at a time booting between each component </s>
<s> it may be your favourite psu but it sounds like it has been causing problems from the start </s>
<s> you don t have to spend a fortune on a new psu just get one from a reliable manufacturer thermaltake corsair antec silverstone </s>
