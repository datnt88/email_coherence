<s> i know this probably gets asked all the time but i would really like some help with this i m looking to hopefully get a new desktop pc sometime soon and i ve just heard a few things that lead me to question just how much i really know about picking the right pc parts so i thought i would ask around and get people s opinions on just what to look for </s>
<s> i would like this new pc to be a great gaming rig preferrably for the least amount of money </s>
<s> i m a fan of intel and nvidia and i would really like this next pc to be able to run games in 3d and in 7 1 surround sound </s>
<s> if possible it should play games like witcher 2 new really awesome looking games on max graphics but i would also like to use it for star wars the old republic whenever it comes out </s>
<s> it should be easily upgradable should the need arise and last as is for a while i hesitate to use the term quot futureproof quot </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> also any recommendations on where to find a 3d monitor and any recommendations on what customization site to go through </s>
<s> or should i build it myself </s>
<s> keep in mind i am a beginner at all this </s>
<s> thanks in advance everyone </s>
<s> and you being a beginner my advice is to get it all at one place </s>
<s> i m not happy as i read posts where folk are complaining about getting their 3d to work </s>
<s> it appears there are not ways to solve their issues without changing video cards or displays so the lesson can cost more than getting a ready to use 3d game machine </s>

<s> i would only recommending building your computer if you have a friend who can supervise </s>
<s> i tried building my own computer and honestly the building part was easy it was just the troubleshooting afterwards if something goes wrong that makes it hard </s>
<s> if you re looking for a good company to build your computer you might want to try ironside ironsidecomputers com </s>
<s> they just started selling online earlier this year but they do a fantastic job at building computers and their customer service is great </s>
<s> at least from my own experience </s>
<s> i agree with grafixdude </s>
<s> i don t know anything about building a computer your self but i can say that ironside did a great job on my computer </s>
<s> i ve had it for awhile now and so far i haven t had a single problem </s>
<s> in my opinion it was definitely worth the money </s>
