<s> i have an ide hdd with an sata dvd rw and it takes about 5 mins to boot </s>
<s> once it finally boots everything runs as smooth as a baby s bottom </s>
<s> but it just takes forever to boot up </s>
<s> but when i unplug the sata dvd rom and plug in a regular ide cd rom drive to the same cable as the hdd and set its jumper to slave it boots in seconds </s>
<s> is there maybe some setting i m missing in my bios </s>
<s> geforce 6100pm m2 v2 0 megatrends bios v02 67 thanks for any advice beau </s>
<s> i ve seen that for years </s>
<s> and since the makers don t seem interested in issuing a bios or fix i use the drive that works best </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well that s a bummer i have all kinds of dvd burners that are sata and all kinds of hard drives that are ide </s>
<s> i guess i m going to have to invest in some ide burners and or some sata hard drives </s>
<s> thanks bob beau </s>
<s> the downside is it doesn t give me 2 devices per ide channel but it did allow me to use some cheaply acquired dvdrw drives </s>
