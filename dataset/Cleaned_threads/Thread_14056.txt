<s> i have a bfg geforce 6200 agp and it says it s overclocked but says a gf6200 can be overclocked to 700mhz core clock after looking at 6200 s overclocking capabilities at various web cites i found a program riva tuner to download it just google it and you will find it fairly quickly is said to overclock this card to the core clock speeds of a gf 6600 if used this program would i fry the graphics card overheat the pc drastically decrease the shelflife of the video card i ve heard that s it s risky to overclock my system info is if it is any help intel p4 2 66ghz ht 512 kingston pc3200 ram agp 8x bfg geforce 6200oc 300watt power supply 1 40gb ata hd win 98 os </s>
<s> i hope you know that oc ing will void that beatiful lifetime warranty </s>
<s> that psu might not be able to handle it </s>
<s> if you oc too much it might fry the card </s>
<s> it will cause your heat to go up </s>
<s> if you do overclock i would make sure that other parts especially the gpu have great cooling </s>
<s> i ve heard quot rumours quot about reducing the shelf life of products but i don t have solid evidence </s>
<s> what games are you playing that you want more fps in </s>
<s> it d be a better investment to get another 512 of memory or upgrade the cpu or even a bigger hard drive </s>
<s> just my 02 </s>
<s> ibrahim </s>
<s> i m getting around 20 frames per second on bf vietnam and i might get far cry soon </s>
<s> if i get it i ll want to run all the highest graphics settings </s>
<s> how mich will adding 512 ram increase my frame rates </s>
<s> when you add another 512 frames will go up way up </s>
<s> i don t want to be a party pooper but far cry on highest settings taxes even the fastest cards out there </s>
<s> you d have to get at least a 6800 to play most settings on high sorry </s>
<s> i m not trying to be mean kind of the truth </s>
<s> quot it s hard to believe but far cry shows that we still have plenty of need for more powerful graphics cards quot and that doesn t even have the fastest card listed </s>
<s> sorry quot when it came to overclocking the 6200 reference card was not the best overclocking unit in the world </s>
<s> we managed to get from 300mhz default core to 332 mhz using the stock cooler </s>
<s> memory was somewhat of a disappointment at 275mhz or 550mhz ddr we only managed to push it to 300mhz or 600mhz ddr which is not the best in the world let me assure you quot if you really want to get a performance boost and want to take some risk try it </s>
<s> but remember your card might not oc that much </s>
<s> i would try this but remember the warranty get the temps on the card oc the card very slowly </s>
<s> but if you want a bit of a bigger boost flash it the way your site says </s>
<s> i m not the best to comment on what effects that could cause but the performance would be greater if you unlocked the pipes as well </s>
<s> just my 02 ibrahim </s>
<s> i used to play bfv a great game </s>
<s> shame most ppl have stopped playing my new actually old computer doesn t even have an open pci slot for a gpu lol </s>
<s> have fun </s>
<s> also what game settings are you playing the game at </s>
<s> ibrahim </s>
<s> i m getting 20 40 frames per second on it </s>
<s> it ll lag sometimes </s>
<s> you can oc using this </s>
<s> i have a 5700le oc ed to over 100mhz from stock core and mem </s>
<s> o unlock coolbits 1 open the start run dialog box and type regedit and hit ok 2 browse to hkey_local_machine software nvidiacorporation global nvtweak 3 then right click and go to new and choose dword value 4 rename the dword value the comes up to coolbits without quotes 5 right click on it to modify it 6 and then change the value to 3 and the base to decimal once you do this go back to your nvidia control panel </s>
<s> you should see some new options </s>
<s> one of these options is clock frequency settings </s>
<s> select this click manual overclocking and then hit detect optimal frequencies </s>
<s> ive found this to be fairly reliable </s>
<s> however use this at your own discretion </s>
<s> keep on eye on temperatures in your case </s>
<s> resolution </s>
<s> it is a little old game though </s>
<s> do you aa af turned on </s>
