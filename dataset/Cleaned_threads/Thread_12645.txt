<s> this d link di 624 router is driving me nuts </s>
<s> it disconects and reconects after 10 minutes or so of being solidly connected at 54mbs </s>
<s> right now it is actually disconnected </s>
<s> now it came back up the bars in my task bar are green and connected while the disconnected wireless network has a cross in it </s>
<s> how can one thing say it is connected while the other contradicts it </s>
<s> if i disable windows firewall it connects to the network only to disconnect a while later </s>
<s> if i enable windows firewall the same thing happens </s>
<s> everything is contradicting something else </s>
<s> i have reseted the router a couple of times to its factory default but the same things happen again </s>
<s> it was working fine last night </s>
<s> my lan is working with no problems </s>
<s> i have had this router for a week now and i wish i had not bought it </s>
<s> update then run your spyware scans </s>
<s> dropped connections can be a side effect of the little vermin </s>
<s> i have run all scans there are to be run </s>
<s> i was just on the phone with these guys from d link support they have reseted and tweaked my settings </s>
<s> it seems to work a little better but when i activate the wep security mode it seems to be going the same old problem </s>
<s> i can t rely on an open system to run my wireless connection </s>
<s> it seems to me very strange that this was not happening for the first week i have had this router </s>
<s> how come all of a sudden it began doing this nonsense </s>
<s> checks out ok that leaves a hardware issue </s>
<s> if the problem persists on another pc that is known to have no issues then the router becomes the primary suspect </s>
<s> i would try another brand </s>
