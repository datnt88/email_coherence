<s> i have a hp a450n and i just added stick of 512 ram so now my im up to 1gb and i also added a new graphics card a gefore 7600gs </s>
<s> my problem is that when i play a game of any kind some kind of box comes up saying something about i need more power in order to fun the card properly or something like that </s>
<s> so i was wonder if i need a new power supply </s>
<s> the one i have right now is 250w </s>
<s> i was think about something around 400w becuase later on i might want to do more upgrading </s>
<s> and i also want to know which kind i should get so that it complies with my system </s>
<s> a good 400 500 watt would work and give you enough power to expand get a decent one you will pay a bit more but your paying for effeciancy and reliability </s>
<s> and check to see if your video card has a addon power spot plug it might need more power to use all of it at full speed </s>
<s> hp s site doesn t give any info on your power supply but it s probably less than 250w and it may be smaller than a standard power supply </s>
<s> standard atx 6 quot x3 5x quot 5 5 quot miniatx 5 quot x3 5 quot x5 quot microatx or sfx 5 quot x3 quot x4 quot or 5 quot x2 5 quot x4 quot once you figure out the size i recommend you get a 350w 400w power supply </s>
<s> if you need a microatx 350w will be the max that s available </s>
<s> i will check on the size and try to get something in my price range </s>
<s> thanks a lot you guys </s>
