<s> i have a new hp pavilion a1510n with xp mce 2005 it has the built onto mother board sound ac 97 with realtek drivers </s>
<s> it sounds ok but i have wondered if i would notice any real inprovement with installing a seperate sound card or would that just be more money for negligible improvement </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> what i found was that it did have less hiss and noise but i had to connect it to a rather big speaker set to notice it </s>
<s> on the headphones i could barely tell </s>
<s> now there is one area that was really better </s>
<s> this was the audio capture </s>
<s> that was definitely many steps up </s>
<s> hope this helps bob </s>
<s> i think there s a definite improvement in sound quality with an audigy 4 x fi over built in sound </s>
<s> definitely worth the 40 </s>
<s> in spite of what the realtek chipset ac97 and others specifications say it doesn t handle eax sound very well or at all </s>
<s> i bought a x fi gamer and love it </s>
<s> i noticed a lot of sounds that i was missing with the ac 97 hi def onboard sound </s>
<s> i spent about 100 on mine and i think it was worth it </s>
