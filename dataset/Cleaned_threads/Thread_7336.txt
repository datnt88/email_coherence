<s> i was wondering if someone could give me the idea of the life of a typical run off the mill dvd writer </s>
<s> i have been using lg dvd writers since a long time on customer s pcs </s>
<s> they have been good </s>
<s> but recently i have seen that the dvd writers go bad after burning 20 25 dvds </s>
<s> the model of the lg dvd writer is gh22ns50 </s>
<s> now these writers are used on different pcs at different locations </s>
<s> so i think i can eliminated bad power supply as the culprit </s>
<s> also all the time the dvds were burnt at 8x or lower speeds </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks sam ps specs of the pcs pentium dual core or core 2 duo asus motherboard with g31 or g41 chipsets 2 gb of ddr2 or ddr3 ram 450 watts smps </s>
<s> but i did encounter some go bad after a few months </s>
<s> it was easy to find out why </s>
<s> most of the cases had a hot enclosure with 2 drives back to back with no air gap </s>
<s> heat kills them fast </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i suspect a decent dvd burner drive last at least 18 24mos </s>
<s> w o some issue </s>
<s> however i have found more issues with poor dvd blanks and or the environments sometimes employed ie factory floor </s>
<s> since many users try to save costs buying some bulk purchase will at times bite them </s>
<s> often they work well but can become flaky either because the blanks are poor or the burner is starting to show wear amp tear the combo of each isn t rewarding </s>
<s> while burn speeds can be auto downgraded many users still want the old level of before and thus complain of poor dvd drive </s>
<s> regardless a typical home user should see in the neighborhood of 400 burns or so in maintained good pc </s>
<s> i exclude other manufacturing issues or quot kids </s>
<s> quot because i view that as a problem </s>
<s> poor handling of blanks and storage is not unheard of </s>
<s> just to be clear if a dvd drive is beginning to show problems just swap it out </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
