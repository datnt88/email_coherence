<s> i have att dsl internet service with a 2wire wireless network router which works ok except for sporadic service interruptions </s>
<s> from time to time there are 5 6 laptops and a printer working from it wirelessly and a dish network receiver wired to it </s>
<s> problem is i have two other dish receivers that need to be connecter by wire in different rooms floors away from where the current 2wire router is located </s>
<s> is there something i can used to connect these receivers by wire to my existing wireless network from 2wire </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> i assume you just cannot run ethernet cable which is the best and most reliable </s>
<s> there are 2 popular options </s>
<s> the ethernet over powerline and a ethernet to wireless bridge </s>
<s> the wireless bridge method tends to be a little cheaper and simpler to setup </s>
<s> the system that carry the data over your electrical lines once they are setup are much less susceptible to random loss than wireless </s>
<s> thanks bill correct i don t want to run wires all over the house </s>
<s> the ethernet to wireless bridge sound like what i want to do </s>
<s> would the linksys wet610n or similar be the device i would need </s>
<s> also do you know if they make one of these with multi port </s>
<s> since i m hooking up the dish receiver if there is a multi port device i could use the same device to hook up the blu ray and tv </s>
<s> i didn t think about those yesterday </s>
<s> again thanks for the help </s>
<s> i picked up the wgps606 for 25 refurb and liked it so much i now have 2 look at that one too </s>
