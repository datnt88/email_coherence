<s> i had a problem that i was told was a rootkit so i decided to reformat my hard drive </s>
<s> details on that problem if necessary are in this thread so now i have a fresh install of xp pro and i need to install my wireless driver </s>
<s> i ve done this successfully at least once before </s>
<s> this time i am having problems </s>
<s> i have the original disc with the drivers that came with my computer </s>
<s> as i was installing the driver the icon appeared in the taskbar with a quot new hardware found quot kind of message </s>
<s> a couple seconds after that my screen switched to a blue screen with lots of white text for a second and then the system restarted </s>
<s> then i have the option to start windows normally in safe mode or last known good configuration </s>
<s> if i start windows normally the blue screen and restart happens again </s>
<s> if i start with last known good configuration i don t have wireless </s>
<s> does anyone know what my problem is </s>
<s> motherboard chipset drivers before the wireless or any other drivers </s>
<s> did you do chipset first </s>
<s> no i didn t do that </s>
<s> i started over and installed the two chipset drivers and a networking driver </s>
<s> are there any other drivers i should install before the wireless one </s>
<s> is there anything else at all i should have to do first </s>
<s> sorry but some machines like a dell need one more thing after i install the os motherboard drivers and the wifi card driver </s>
<s> it s called quickset and maybe your machine needs this or something like it </s>
<s> i m going to plead with all members to start making good posts </s>
<s> include those make and model numbers to save you time and getting asked for the detail </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s a dell inspiron 600m </s>
<s> is the quickset another driver that should be on my disc or is it something different </s>
<s> google what that is and yes without it all dells i work on can t use wifi </s>
<s> not a driver </s>
<s> i installed the chipset drivers quickset and several other drivers and i m still having the same problem </s>
<s> the computer says that no wireless adapter has been installed </s>
<s> when i install the wireless driver it begins to detect it but then the computer crashes </s>
<s> is it possible that the wireless adapter was damaged somehow </s>
<s> i find the internals to give out </s>
<s> let s say you have a pc card slot </s>
<s> try something like this one _ gt i keep one around or some usb version for days like this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for all the help </s>
