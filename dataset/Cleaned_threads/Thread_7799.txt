<s> i had built my computer with a wd 640 black as my boot drive </s>
<s> i decided i wanted to add a velociraptor 300 as my boot drive </s>
<s> i had the 640 black partitioned in three even splits </s>
<s> i added the vr300 and ran the acronis true image program and did the clone disk </s>
<s> i let it do the auto thing and even though the quot c quot partition at 79gb on it and one partition had 121gb on it and one had only 5gb on it and this was less then 300gb </s>
<s> so i did not think then it would matter that i was cloning a larger drive to a smaller drive </s>
<s> it cloned it and then i went in and reformated the 121gb part as i did not need that data cloned just the operating system </s>
<s> now how do i get the system to boot off the new drive </s>
<s> i still want to use the 640 black and so i will remove the op from it when i get this to work </s>
<s> i tried just having only the new drive plugged in and got a ntrdl is missing </s>
<s> so i plugged them all back in and it would not boot at all </s>
<s> so i left the new one unplugged and it boots up like normal </s>
<s> but if i plug the new one in now it won t boot and i get the same error </s>
<s> at first it would not try and boot off the new one </s>
<s> now if it is plugged in it tries and gets the error </s>
<s> i can t even boot up to reformat the new drive </s>
<s> what the heck have i done </s>
<s> what should i do now </s>
<s> i would have avoid acronis altogether </s>
<s> all this partitioning and more seems to have ended badly </s>
<s> what i learned years ago is to learn the native tools use simpler setups so repairs could be done without calling acronis </s>
<s> if i had to deal with this i would install just the new drive clean it off by booting my xp other cd and installing the os and drivers </s>
<s> then i d add the old drive and recover my stuff </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the win 7 save image restore image did not work either </s>
<s> can t understand as my computer is no different then anyone elses </s>
<s> i ended up just backing up my other quot c quot hard drive and then totally re installing the os on the wdvr like you said </s>
<s> did all the updates and did the backup restore and it works </s>
<s> i want to first say i am a loyal wd user </s>
<s> i have nothing but on 4 systems </s>
<s> not sure what is on my wife s laptop </s>
<s> none have ever failed me </s>
<s> but the reason i was adding the velociraptor drive was to increase my windows experience rating like it was going to matter </s>
<s> my processor was at 7 3 my memory was at 7 5 my graphics was at 7 6 7 6 </s>
<s> but my harddrive was only at 5 9 that was the wd 640 black </s>
<s> well the velociraptor is at 5 9 also </s>
<s> so all that and i did not improve a bit </s>
<s> so now my plan is to pull it back out and go back to my 640 black and put this one in my kids which has a 5 4 rating on his harddrive </s>
<s> like i said i like wd and still will continue to build wd </s>
<s> but this was a little disheartening </s>
<s> the quot media speed quot of the drives is at or about sata 1 x speeds </s>
<s> while a few per cent points can be gained by going to 3 0 and 6 0 gb speeds the quot media speed quot appears to be unchanged </s>
<s> quot linear transfer rates quot seem to be governed by this too </s>
<s> more rpms help a little but not the media speed as it gets the needed sectors under the heads faster </s>
<s> i m sure there is a paper web page about this but the lesson is expensive as you figure out that windows scores are not a good measure of a machine and could have folk chasing rainbows or other things </s>
<s> hope this helps bob </s>
<s> partition after successfully creating the boot partition then manually create the other partitions and copy the applicable data to them </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
