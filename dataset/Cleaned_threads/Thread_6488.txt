<s> i was given an older gateway laptop with an orinoco wireless lan card built in </s>
<s> i have updated the driver so that i could use wpa </s>
<s> i have a belkin router g and a desktop and an ipod connected </s>
<s> i get great connection speeds with my other devices through my dsl connection however the gateway laptop is getting less than dial up speed 17k i am sure it is some kind of setting tweak </s>
<s> please provide me with any advice </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you gave the slim version of the details </s>
<s> first is it setup per our forum sticky </s>
<s> some enable ap isolation disable ssid try mac filters and end up with slow speeds </s>
<s> sometimes its the firmware in the router or someone is running p2p on the other connection </s>
<s> the story is much too light here and i can t ask all the questions </s>
<s> let s let you tell more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sure the details are that i have no idea what mac filtering is the ssid is enabled and i have no idea what ap isolation is </s>
<s> the firmware in my router is current </s>
<s> the laptop has 512mb of memorty and an intel 4 m at 2 18ghz </s>
<s> the orinoco driver is updated and it shows connected as if it were 11mbps </s>
<s> additoinally i cannot access the other computer on the network from that laptop </s>
<s> when it does appear i get an erro stating that that computer is unaccessible and i may not have permissions </s>
<s> contact administrator </s>
<s> i am not a uber geek please talk to me like i m four lol </s>
<s> that s right </s>
<s> mixed mode on the router can be fickle </s>
<s> but you didn t confirm if the setup was per our forum </s>
<s> no word about security the channel you tried and the details </s>
<s> gt if you don t want to know networking go find network magic see google com it s very good for us that don t want to find why it didn t share </s>
