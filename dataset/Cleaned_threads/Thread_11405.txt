<s> i think samsung has an 8 quot tablet coming out soon </s>
<s> i want to buy a tablet but have been wavering between a 7 quot for its compact size and 10 quot because it would be easier to read </s>
<s> i wouldn t be doing anything serious on it maybe surfing and photos solitaire emails </s>
<s> i have an ereader now i have to have the print on medium large so 7 quot might be hard to read i m a senior </s>
<s> i m wondering if anyone has used both a 7 quot and 10 quot and if they think an 8 quot would be a good compromise </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i m a senior but i can read my 7 quot kindle fire just fine </s>
<s> just because you re a senior doesn t mean your eyes aren t any good i did have to have cataracts removed 3 years ago </s>
<s> i d say that how much you re going to travel and how much it would bother you to have something take more space not to mention cost would be factors to consider </s>
<s> you should consider battery life </s>
<s> another thing is typing </s>
<s> the onscreen keyboard on my kindle leaves a lot to be desired and some web sites that require sign ons are really difficult to position so that you can get your id and password in </s>
<s> personally i travel very little and will take my nice 15 quot laptop 95 of the time over a tablet </s>
<s> only you can weigh how these factors stack up for you though </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> what will be it s special feature other than having today s tablets </s>
<s> both are the good and everyone have a different choice its totally depend upon your personal will and choice </s>
