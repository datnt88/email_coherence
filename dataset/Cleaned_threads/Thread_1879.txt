<s> hi i was working with my computer and suddenly it froze </s>
<s> then after rebutting the monitor its does not come up </s>
<s> its stays black with a factory message stating that it has no problems and to check the cable connection </s>
<s> i have unplugged restarted from scratch several times with no luck </s>
<s> i can hear the computer working and doing something but nothings comes up to the monitor </s>
<s> i even have restarted with no other devices connected to my computer </s>
<s> i have a gateway pc1500 xp thanks </s>
<s> it could be the cable or it could be the video board </s>
<s> first i would reload the video drivers </s>
<s> if that does not work can you borrow another monitor to plug in </s>
<s> if it works then your monitor needs to go to the shop for a new cable </s>
<s> if the substitute monitor does not work then your video board may need to be replaced </s>
<s> hope this helps frank </s>
<s> thank you frank i will try this and will let you know ramon </s>
<s> check for pc issues </s>
<s> if your monitor claims it has no video input trust it </s>
