<s> i have recently purchased a sony dvd rw dw u18a and haven t succesfully burned one dvd yet </s>
<s> the burn process fails at the last 10 or so i can t remember the exact error message but it entails failed </s>
<s> i have tried burning a dvd mixed data film audio with the most recent nero and alcohol and yet it still fails </s>
<s> i have tried looking for updated drivers for the dvdrw but they don t seem to exist help </s>
<s> i am running winxp </s>
<s> 1 you are right </s>
<s> no drivers </s>
<s> none are required </s>
<s> 2 you didn t say if you tried with the software they supplied </s>
<s> 3 try it with the imapi service disabled </s>
<s> 4 xp </s>
<s> sp2 </s>
<s> all the drivers have been updated </s>
<s> tip microsoft doesn t do this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> 1 ok 2 i wasn t supplied any software with it 3 how do i disable the imapi and what does this do </s>
<s> 4 not installed sp2 as i believe at the moment it causes more problems than it cures </s>
<s> quot i can t remember the exact error message quot knowing the error message would be a big help </s>
<s> when burning 1 slow down the write speed to 1 2 the default 2 walk away from the system while burning other thoughts 1 not as bad with xp but possible incompatable memory chips </s>
<s> 2 check for spy ware virus 3 quality of disk 4 capacity of disk 5 do nero and alcohol play nice together </s>
<s> 1 ok 2 i wasn t supplied any software with it big mistake </s>
<s> what many find out is they get laughable support on bare drives </s>
<s> if it was mine i d make sure the firmware is uptodate and see if dvdshrink works with it </s>
<s> 3 how do i disable the imapi and what does this do </s>
<s> i do not hold hands </s>
<s> you would type xp imapi into google com 4 not installed sp2 as i believe at the moment it causes more problems than it cures your choice </s>
<s> and this may sound bad but i move quickly to update all drivers firmware and the os so i know i m stable </s>
<s> you haven t </s>
<s> you picked up a bare drive and that means you are an expert or have great support systems </s>
<s> i ve shared what i would do and you have to decide what to do next </s>
<s> let me be blunt </s>
<s> you may eventually find out what s wrong but without latest firmware drivers and sp2 i leave you to figure it out </s>
<s> cheers bob </s>
<s> yeah thanks for that mr proffitt i can t help noticing that on most of your replies to peoples questions including mine you treat them as imbeciles when all they are doing is asking for a little help </s>
<s> maybe it s time for you to hang up your keyboard and do something less stressful as your highly paid high pressure job seems to be taking its toll hahaha </s>
<s> quot i ve shared what i would do and you have to decide i leave you to figure it out quot cheers </s>
<s> your last reply did not supply any feedback if dvdshrink worked or not </s>
<s> as to your ire you should direct it to the friendly people that took your money </s>
<s> i pull all the nasty problems up on the table for discussion </s>
<s> some will not want to hear that a bare drive is trouble for most owners </s>
<s> get over it and let s whip this drive into working </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks mate </s>
<s> i ve put burn speed down to 2 but still problems </s>
<s> i ve walked away whilst burning many a time </s>
<s> hahaha </s>
<s> i ve checked for virus spyware etc and quot i m clean quot </s>
<s> quality of disk they re datawrite yellow v2 </s>
<s> capacity of disk 4 76gb </s>
<s> i ve never had conflicts of any sort with nero or alchohol both being installed </s>
<s> apologies if i did sound irate but i m sure you can understand why people get shirty especially if they re not as technically offay as some </s>
<s> i ll check dvdshrink out </s>
<s> you ve been taken a little advantage of by the person place that took your money gave you a bare drive and tossed in the deep end of the pool </s>
<s> it s not funny </s>
<s> and while you can beat me up i have to pull all the dirty items up on the table so we can work the issues </s>
<s> it would be interesting if dvdshrink was able to dupe and make a good dvd since that points to updates needed in nero other or even a firmware update </s>
<s> these bagged drives are for oems that update the firmware and more bob </s>
<s> as to bob s question to you about nero and alcohol working together i think just listening to people that use them together the answer is sometimes </s>
<s> dvdshrink and nero work very well together </s>
<s> another factor you might consider </s>
<s> dvd burning more so than cd reinstituted the old problem of media compatibility </s>
<s> you have to find what media works best on your machine mine doesn t like sony and then pick out the good quality from that list </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> thanks chuck </s>
<s> hiya rob i tried dvdshrink and the burn failed again at the lead out part of the disc so close so close </s>
<s> from what i gather searching on the web sony use other peoples drives and rename them as sony possibly why i can t find any firmware updates etc </s>
<s> the dw u18a see discussions like this quot only use discs that the writer does like </s>
<s> the solution here is to stop using the dvd r discs that don t work </s>
<s> a firmware update probably will not help you because your current firmware is not old enough to be significantly improved upon by a firmware update quot 1 are you using dvd r </s>
<s> 2 did it ever work </s>
<s> 3 with what make type media </s>
<s> 4 looks like you are not alone </s>
<s> i d get another model but do try dvd rw or dvd rw until you sort it out </s>
<s> have you been talking to the supplier </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks i ll give the salient points a try and let you know how i get on </s>
<s> if you do not have usb 2 0 installed try burning at 4x speed </s>
