<s> i am buying a new computer </s>
<s> i will be running a small web design company on the computer playing somewhat highly graphical games and doing a lot of multimedia work </s>
<s> i need to know which is the better buy and what will last me longer </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> intel amd oh and i have heard that if i buy a very good graphics card for the intel i would have great gaming and multimedia is that true </s>
<s> or would i need the amd </s>
<s> well i have always been an amd man they serve me well with gaming rite now i have an amd sempron 2500 which is 1 4ghz and 768mb of ram my games are good i havent used pentuim d yet i only used pentuim4 but the amd seems to be a little better but if its being used for mohaa and bf2 and hl2 i d go with amd i hope this helps </s>
<s> amd x2 dual destroys the pentium d and i m not alone in this opinion </s>
<s> i ve got a the x2 and it is sweet </s>
<s> i d been a little concerned that these pre config s might not meet your needs </s>
<s> i d like to learn what the power supply is rated at you ll want at least 350w 420w or higher would be good 500 w is best </s>
<s> the graphics card may need an upgrade if you do heavy graphics for web like manipulation in photoshop and for your gaming needs </s>
<s> that could be a few hundred bones alone </s>
<s> i d definitely want 10 100 1000 base t ethernet if you do web development for a living </s>
<s> uploading sites would blaze with cat7 speed right </s>
<s> that s a mobo and ethernet card issue i d consider for now and for future needs </s>
<s> i d also wonder if you have enough drive bays internal and external for all your needs </s>
<s> consider monarch computing for a more customized build </s>
<s> you might pay a few hundred extra up front but it is for value in all the right places </s>
<s> or you may be upgrading later with heavy limitations like your mobo and expansion slots </s>
<s> you can search my posts profile to read about my pc rig i built for 2300 including everything operating system full rig monitor keyboard etc </s>
<s> good luck cheers </s>
<s> i think for the money this is the best deal on the market </s>
<s> gateway 3800 desktop with 19 monitor printer cable surge protector </s>
<s> dell hp gateway etc </s>
<s> all install bloatware on their computers which clogs the hard drive uses system ram and slows the machine down overall </s>
<s> they also put crappy power supplies which will need to be replaced if you want a good graphics card </s>
<s> the cases are badly designed and there is a risk of the computer overheating </s>
<s> if you build your own you can choose exactly what components you want right down to which cpu cooler you prefer </s>
<s> you ll know that the components are quality after all you picked them </s>
<s> if you think you re capable of building post again with your budget and i ll find a setup for you </s>
