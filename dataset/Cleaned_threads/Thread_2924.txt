<s> i m looking at buying the cyberpower ultimate gaming desktop however i ve read in reviews that there are issues with vista in terms of the drivers or something like that </s>
<s> then i called cyberpower and talked to a rep about it and she said that it is definitely a problem and that certain games may not be recognizable to vista espeically older games </s>
<s> she said that if i took the vista out and replaced it with xp pro i would have no problems at all </s>
<s> so my question is how big a problem is this </s>
<s> does anyone know exactly what games i would be able to play and what games i wouldn t </s>
<s> i am mostly interested in playing new games anyway so i was wondering if this would be a nonissue for me </s>
<s> also does anyone know how long it will take before these issues with vista are worked out </s>
<s> and lastly what is the difference between xp pro and vista </s>
<s> i know vista is new but am i really hurting myself by not getting vista and instead settling for xp pro </s>
<s> my uses for the pc would only be for gaming internet photo storage and some word processing </s>
<s> and advice is greatly appreciated since i am a total computer noob and am completely lost when it comes to this stuff </s>
<s> stick with xp pro </s>
<s> your pc should come with a free vista upgrade that you can use when vista stabilizes probably when sp1 is released </s>
<s> as for compatibility here s a list quot compatible quot doesn t guarantee it will play without issue </s>
<s> xp is a very stable operating system with few bugs and vista is new with lots of compatibality issues and such therefore i would recomend xp </s>
<s> then in a few years when microsoft works out all the problems you can upgrade to vista </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> chris </s>
<s> stay away from vista it s broken and has uncounted compatibility issues </s>
<s> xp and xp pro are solid performers </s>
<s> and vista takes tons of resources and hd space </s>
<s> i ve been watching it since it was announced and am not impressed </s>
<s> i got the free upgrade and attempted to install it big failure </s>
<s> first i downloaded vista upgrade advisor and removed like half the programs on my computer that were causing compatibility issues </s>
<s> next i started to install it i got about 3 4 the way done and then it stopped with a message telling me to install upgrade advisor and fix compatibility issues which i already did </s>
<s> upgrade advisor said everything was correct so i tried again and got the same problem so i said the heck with it and tossed it so in the end i lost like half of my programs and documents and still have xp </s>
<s> pissed the hell outta me </s>
