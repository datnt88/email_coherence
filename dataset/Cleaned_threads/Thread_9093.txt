<s> i need to add some extra ide discs to my server but already have 3 and a cd drive in it </s>
<s> if i buy a seperate pci ide controller will it work alongside the existing one in the motherboard allowing me another 4 drives or will there be a conflict </s>
<s> i ve had a look around various web sites but can t find anything that answers this question </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> quot i ve had a look around various web sites but can t find anything that answers this question quot the question is a little unclear to me </s>
<s> maybe you want some controller that will quot just work quot without all the hoopla of drivers and more </s>
<s> the short answer is that there was no standard in the basic design for this so you step off into drivers and more </s>
<s> you also may have skipped the usual suspect of promise technology which has the cards and you can read the manuals </s>
<s> here s their web site for example is a manual for one of the products </s>
<s> as you can tell you can t put cdrom type devices on it </s>
<s> but that s not a big deal since the hard disks 4 can go on the promise and the cdrom 4 units can be on your motherboard </s>
<s> when allocating watts for each drive use about 30 watts per drive </s>
<s> can get you some other numbers so you don t overtax the psu </s>
<s> bob bob </s>
<s> you need to give a lot more info to get this right </s>
<s> what brand model server do you have </s>
<s> is it a brand name or a clone </s>
<s> is there even room inside for more drives </s>
<s> are the existing drives scsi or ide many servers use scsi drives </s>
<s> you might consider adding a snap server to the network to add disk space instead of adding more drives to the system </s>
