<s> what equipment is required to do vpn </s>
<s> can you just use the two computers you want to network </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> no special equipment is needed </s>
<s> if your running xp on both ends the necessary protocols are already there </s>
<s> you simply need to set up the vpn </s>
<s> so i would like to connect to a server at my school </s>
<s> do i need to set it up here and at the school </s>
<s> the school s server needs to allow incoming vpn connections </s>
<s> you then need to create a vpn connection on your pc </s>
<s> your vpn will find the remote server via ip address or fqdn fully qualified domain name </s>
<s> so just out of curiosity can you set up vpn between two different computers </s>
<s> say like have two xp home editions connect without a server just the pc </s>
<s> for an example say you wanted to connect to a relatives computer through vpn </s>
<s> could you do this with just the pc and dsl </s>
<s> this would work fine if the computer has a static ip address </s>
<s> you could still connect without having a static ip but you would have to call the relative each time you want to connect and have them tell you the current ip address </s>
<s> some isp s don t offer static addresses or they charge you more for the convenience </s>
<s> but if they have a static ip simply create a vpn on your computer and then configure the relative s computer to act as a vpn server </s>
<s> how do you find the ip address </s>
<s> also how do you configure as a vpn server </s>
<s> thanks i very much appreciate your posts </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ok i found the ip addresses and both of our computers have in our home have the same one </s>
<s> will this be the same as on the schools computers if i want to connect to a school server </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it s qite simple </s>
<s> open network connections from control panel </s>
<s> under network tasks click create a new connection </s>
<s> the wizard appears and you simply follow the prompts </s>
<s> choose to set up an advanced connection </s>
<s> regarding finding ip addresses open command prompt and type ipconfig all to see info relating to all the network connections you have </s>
<s> or simply ipconfig if there is only 1 computer </s>
<s> hello i want set up vpn connection over more computers and more ip is there any one who know more about this </s>
<s> would be great </s>
<s> send me a message and ill respond quick back to you </s>
