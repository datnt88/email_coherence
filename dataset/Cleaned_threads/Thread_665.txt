<s> hi everyone my question is pretty straight forward </s>
<s> the cell processor that is used to power the playstation 3 does anyone know if i could purchase that processor as a stand alone and not as part of the ps3 </s>
<s> it is an awesome processor and a gigantic step forward i would like to build my new pc around it if it is available for purchase </s>
<s> thanks and happy thanksgiving </s>
<s> but i am curious </s>
<s> could you load an os to it </s>
<s> if yes then why not try it that way </s>
<s> if this processor is not of intel or amd then you will have lots of problem getting a motherboard or design your own </s>
<s> is that what you are going to do </s>
<s> so good luck and have fun </s>
<s> you can get the linux os for ps3 and turn that into a quot pc quot but you can t get a cell processor and motherboard to create a cell based pc </s>
<s> at the end supplies references and links of interest </s>
<s> personally i d just look into cheap x86 sbcs </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> right now as a ps3 the cell processor is capable of booting the debian linux kernel with just some configs </s>
<s> although i use linux and windows in tangent i prefer windows in which case if i built a cell based pc i would have to do some extensive configuring in order to allow windows to boot but it is possible </s>
<s> in my opinion for the processor it is well worth it </s>
<s> i am going to get a quad core x86 possibly either xeon or phenom architecture </s>
<s> but looking at the cell article i read i was amazed at the the architecture and ability of the chip and wondered if it was available </s>
<s> you should skip it for some x86 a ps3 or if you are really wanting to get embedded the arm family </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> arms were powerfull processors </s>
<s> i thought that they were embedded for pocket pc s and what not </s>
<s> as for the dev kit x86 emulators are available online for the cell processor so you can run windows in the emulating enviroment </s>
<s> which of course i know would limit the power of windows over the hardware but the emulator is open source and i thought maybe i could tweak it </s>
<s> if not i could boot the debian kernel then run a virtual machine or emulator program directory from the kernel </s>
<s> as for a ps3 i wouldn t buy one for two reasons the first being i wouldn t use it as a pc it s a game console </s>
<s> second i wouldn t use it as a game system i am an xbox fan and as such already have an xbox which i enjoy </s>
<s> all this was just a far off option one that i would have to consider when i came across it </s>
<s> it was always my intention to go with an x86 processor but i was curious if it was available for purchase </s>
<s> if quot power quot is what you want why not skip right to the sun com platforms </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but your reply is talking about arm embed processors correct </s>
<s> as for the sun comment i do not follow </s>
<s> are you speaking of the sun architecture or solaris os </s>
<s> the cell processor is something of a mystery to those that are new to embedded computing </s>
<s> i wonder if you are aware of this subject as well as what a sbc is </s>
<s> if not i need to adjust my replies </s>
<s> i m getting the feeling you are not into such and should be gently shown more x86 gear </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> however i am aware of enough information on the topic </s>
<s> the cell processor itself is not an embedded computer chip it is a full fledge microprocessor connected to the board via a socket not soldered on like an embed </s>
<s> as far as sbc that is a single board computer it means everything needed to make a device a computing device is put onto one circuit board </s>
<s> i am not interested in sbc but i am pretty sure that the cell processor is not an embed </s>
<s> you are looking for some quot system quot like we have in pcs where you get your cpu in some stock form for boards etc </s>
<s> this is pretty much a powerpc and x86 phenom </s>
<s> i suggest you dive into quot that other market quot and attend a few quot other than x86 quot shows to get your feet wet </s>
<s> your replies mean that you should look at x86 gear </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no cell is not an embed it is a microprocessor that s why i asked if it was available for purchase </s>
<s> therefore i could buy the processor and then the corresponding socket motherboard to build a pc </s>
<s> and yes the cell processor is a power risc platform not x86 </s>
<s> but i am able to get windows to run on risc without any problem that is why i am curious </s>
<s> some label the ps3 an quot embedded quot system </s>
<s> and today people are using x86 for embedded systems </s>
<s> this means the cell processor is not so limited to be this or not but let s skip to why i noted the embedded market </s>
<s> it s where you would find your cpu </s>
<s> remember it won t work in your common x86 board so by itself it is pretty much like a paper weight </s>
<s> why isn t a sbc ps3 or dev kit the answer for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i had read an article that stated that ibm was beginning to put cell chips in high end servers non embeded </s>
<s> so i figured someone might know if they were available yet </s>
<s> this was the reason for my posting </s>
<s> sbc is not an option for me because it limits the design of my syswtem in ways which would take to long to explain </s>
<s> as for actually buying a ps3 i don t want one i don t want to use the console as a pc and i am an xbox fan and very satisfied with my 360 besides the ps3 to me says game console not computer it may for other just not for me i prefer to build my machines </s>
<s> and like you said a dev kit costs thousands of dollars </s>
<s> therefore my question was answered the processor is not available and i will stay within the x86 64 world </s>
<s> no other power risc processor impresses me </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
