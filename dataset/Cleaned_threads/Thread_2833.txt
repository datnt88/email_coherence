<s> we have a home netweok with a netgear wgr 614 router </s>
<s> the main computer which is connected to the dsl modem and router works ok but the wirelss connections do not work </s>
<s> they have in the past but the other desktop always got a low signal strength </s>
<s> the laptop signal was always strong on the floor above </s>
<s> verizon does not support netgear so they won t be any help </s>
<s> could the router have gone bad </s>
<s> we haven t changed anything on the setup </s>
<s> would we be better off getting a new stronger router with a speed booster </s>
<s> verizon is trying to sell us fios but we re not sure it would work in our house and don t want any more wires around </s>
<s> the main computer is faster and always gets on line faster </s>
<s> i would appreciate any suggestions before we buy anything </s>
<s> many routers arrive with out of date firmware or wireless disabled </s>
<s> check both </s>

<s> thanks </s>
<s> i disconnected one wire from the router and then reconnectged it and tried again </s>
<s> i got a connection on the other desktop but the signal was so low i couldn t connect to the internet </s>
<s> i am on the laptop now so that gives me more information but doesn t clarify what the real problem is </s>
<s> i have heard that vertical connections work better than horizontal ones </s>
<s> are you using a westell 6100 modem router with your verizon dsl </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> why you didn t check the items i wrote about </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it wasn t that i ignored your suggestion i just remembered once before that netgear had asked me to unplug the connection for a while and it helped then </s>
<s> so i tried it again and it worked well for the laptop but the desktop got too low a signal to access the internet </s>
<s> if it works so well with the laptop i figured it is not the router but something else </s>
<s> i will check again with netgear and give them my updated information and ask about updates </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i am using a westell 2110 dual connect router with verizon </s>
<s> the model is b90 210015 04 i have noticed that they now offer a combined modem and router with their service </s>
<s> we need to check with them anyway since we could get a much cheaper rate by paying for a year </s>
<s> they were supposed to replace the model some time ago and didn t </s>
<s> i found a new ehternet cable made all the difference in the connection </s>
<s> we also moved it up higher so it didn t get bumped </s>
<s> router uses the ip of 192 168 1 1 it may br conflicting with the netgear router </s>
<s> log in to the westell router </s>
<s> if you cannot run belarc advisor and see what the ip for the westell is </s>
<s> if it is 192 168 1 1 then change the netgear router to 192 168 7 1 and it should solve the problem </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
