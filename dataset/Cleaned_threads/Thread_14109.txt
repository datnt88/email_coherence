<s> i was given a hp pavilion that has the network card on the mb </s>
<s> i replaced the card with a netgear fa 311 pci adapter when the original decided it had worked long enough </s>
<s> however i can t get the computer to recognize the new card </s>
<s> i have tried uninstalling and disabling the old card but i get a quot code 10 quot error message whatever that means </s>
<s> do i need to get into the bios to change stuff and if so how do i do that </s>
<s> i have windows xp but i don t know the model number of the computer it s not anywhere on the case </s>
<s> hp support told me to contact netgear and netgear doesn t seem to know what i m talking about </s>
<s> i appreciate your help the kids are driving me nuts with only one computer connected to the web </s>
<s> talk about spoiled </s>
<s> when i was a kid computers were made out of rocks and you had to use your feet to stop the car </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> what you didn t write in your post is if you installed a driver for said card </s>
<s> a clue is this user s review quot easier install driver than the netgear 311 but netgear packaged the wrong software driver disk with my 310 they send me the 311 driver disk </s>
<s> i figured if they included the 311 driver there must be a good reason but that turned out to be a poor assumption </s>
<s> after wasting sometime with the wrong driver i got the 310 driver from their site and install was pretty easy from there </s>
<s> it works very well i just wish netgear was a little more careful quot they had some 311 s too and noted difficulty with the driver install </s>
<s> in closing i think something fishy is going on here and i d just get another card </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> look over and if you download documentation and files the latest date i see is 2001 this is years before windows xp so it may be just a bum card </s>
<s> try another make model </s>
<s> or at least another slot bob bob </s>
<s> if you haven t already go to hp s web site go to the knowledgebase and do a search on the quot code 10 quot error message </s>
<s> try pressing the delete or ctrl or f10 key during the power on but before windows starts to load that should get you into the bios </s>
<s> good luck ciao </s>
