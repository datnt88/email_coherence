<s> i am working to set up a home business i am developing a web site to sell albums i have a linux and an xp pro system that i want to network together </s>
<s> i also want to burn most of my albums to cd after first converting them to mpegs </s>
<s> one of my concerns is security on a wireless network but more than that i have a neighbor that has put a radio antenna up on his roof and its not so bad anymore but when he gets on his cb and cranks up his amplifier i get him coning over my computer speakers and ive even heard him over my tv set which is satellite </s>
<s> i know that amplifing is illegal but trying to get any action out of the fcc is next to impossible </s>
<s> thats why i am thinking of going a physical ethernet network </s>
<s> any comments would be appreacated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> its secured and you don t have to worry about radio interference its negligible if any as for your tv and pc speaker ask your radio shack people for a device that can reduce such interference </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> hey thanks melati thats what i thought too </s>
