<s> hello all i currently have a dilemma </s>
<s> i currently have an hp pavilion a6700f desktop pc that i use for recording music </s>
<s> i use the computer program pro tools 8 but i am trying to make my machine efficient enough to handle the newest version of protools </s>
<s> now it doesn t do badly but for the amount of music i am currently doing i need it to function at an optimal level hence i am interested in doing some upgrades </s>
<s> i am new at trying to upgrade computers because usually when they become obsolete i scrap them to get another model but my music partner told me it may be more cost efficient simply to upgrade my machine </s>
<s> so my questions are what component can i upgrade without having to buy a new computer case </s>
<s> would i be able to change the motherboard so i can have a faster processor and store more memory </s>
<s> what kind of power supply can fit in my model of hp </s>
<s> any suggestions would be very helpful </s>
<s> below are my computer specs thank you ahead of time </s>
<s> hp pavilion a6700f desktop pc motherboard mcp61pm hm nettle3 processor phenom x4 9150e memory 4gb hard drive 500 gb power supply 300w windows vista </s>
<s> right now you are rapidly reaching that point of upgrading would be more cost effective </s>
<s> specifically your cpu is 1 8ghz so to upgrade your cpu you are looking at a couple hundred </s>
<s> ram is almost always more is better if you have a 64bit os if your os is 32bit you have reached your limit </s>
<s> you might get a ssd drive those are fast but the price is still pretty high </s>
<s> looking on new egg i found machines that would be an upgrade for the sub 500 range </s>
<s> of course you could pay a bit more and get something more </s>
<s> hope this helped </s>
<s> unless a member who is using the app comes on the boards the rest of us are left guessing </s>
<s> hp says your machine has vista 64 </s>
<s> i could tell you to add ram won t hurt anything but if your not using all the 4gb won t be of much value </s>
<s> ram gt gt gt gt 2x2gb 50 bucks </s>
<s> your machine has integrate video </s>
<s> avid suggest a dedicated video card </s>
<s> gpu gt gt gt gt gt hd4550 5450 50 bucks </s>
<s> you might want to spend a little time with task manager and perf monitor windows tools </s>
<s> you don t have to become a wizard with these tools just a basic understanding will let you spot where the machine needs a little help </s>
