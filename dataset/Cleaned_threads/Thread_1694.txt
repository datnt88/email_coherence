<s> i am running xp pro with a sony 710a drive and have tried nero 6 to back up some home video files that are avi format and have already made 2 expensive coasters </s>
<s> i have no idea if i should bother with dl format or just use a bunch of single layer dvds </s>
<s> i am not new to computers but new to doing this </s>
<s> can someone help me out please </s>
<s> my camcorder is a sony hi 8 and i am copying the video using the dv cable into windows movie maker </s>
<s> then trying to copy the file with nero udf </s>
<s> i don t even know what the difference is with the udf formats and the udf physical or virtual format </s>
<s> is it better to copy with udf 2 01 or does it matter </s>
<s> thanks in advance for the help </s>
<s> meg </s>
<s> since all we need to do is quot backup quot and no conversion to dvd playable format is noted cdburnerxp is free and what i use to do this </s>
<s> hint </s>
<s> google com bob </s>
<s> i checked out cdburnerxp it does not look like it supports double layer dvds </s>
<s> my videos are very long will need either 2 dl or 4 single layer dvds to back up </s>
<s> i ll keep my eye open for when they release the new version of cdburnerxp which is supposed to support dual layer </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
