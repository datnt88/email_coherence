<s> hey everybody i m a newbie on these forums </s>
<s> i was on cnet live today </s>
<s> they directed me here </s>
<s> i called in asking about wanting to build a system now with one hard drive but later as my budget allows add additional hard drives in a raid array </s>
<s> the only way i know how to do this is to reinstall the os and start from scratch </s>
<s> is there a way to streamline this process so i can add drives and not lose my data or rebuild the array every time </s>
<s> someone would do that by bouncing their os image to a bigger drive </s>
<s> such as installing the raid and using acronis to copy the existing drive to the raid </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok so right now i m starting with a 1tb seagate hard drive </s>
<s> what you are saying is when i am ready to add matching hard drives i should buy an extra one to make a backup image build the raid array and then restore the image now on the raid array </s>
<s> i guess then i could wipe the back up hard drive and take it back to the store for a refund </s>
<s> this is a good idea and defiantly solves the problem of losing my data but the process still isn t what i m looking for </s>
<s> maybe i m asking for too much but i just want an easy way to add hard drives to an array without having to rebuild the array or back up my data </s>
<s> after all one of the main advantages of using raid is that you don t need to make backups because you would have to have two or more hard drives fail at the same time before the array failed </s>
<s> it may be time to address what the backup plans are </s>
<s> imagine my shock yesterday as a friend showed me their 20 tb storage server </s>
<s> they didn t have an answer to what to do if it was struck by lightning theft quot oops i deleted it quot bob </s>
<s> first of all i want to start by saying i am a person who has 4 backups of my essential data at any given time </s>
<s> i keep a golden image of my machines as well backup my personal data in several locations </s>
<s> but to have a complete disk image of a raid array that i want to eventually reach 4tb would just be impractical </s>
<s> i understand what your saying </s>
<s> it is important to have backups of your data so you can get everything back in the event of a catastrophe but all i want to do is build my system with one hard drive now and add more in the future the easiest way possible </s>
<s> i wonder if you didn t like the solution since you end up with a drive along the way </s>
<s> isn t time money </s>
<s> or rather let be very blunt here </s>
<s> no current solution exists for you to install drive number 2 and create a raid without a wipeout of the first drive </s>
<s> is that more clear </s>
