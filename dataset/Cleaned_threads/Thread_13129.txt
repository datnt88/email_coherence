<s> i have recently purchased a gainward 7950gt golden sample 256mb i do alot of gaming so this cam to quite a dissapointment for me i used to have a 6600 512mb geforce dont know the make and in bf2 i used to get an fps of 50 60 average and ever sinse i put this 7950gt in im getting 10 20 40 fps averaging between them i have been told that i need a better power supply i currently have a 400w bog standard psu and i have been told i need one with a special slot for the graphix card hpu 4r580 the pink one at the bottom i looked on reviews of this card and should be getting 100 fps and on quake 4 around 178fps at the moment i am getting 10 40 fps in bf2 battlefield2 would this power supply really make all the difference from 20fps to 100fps i just dont see how a power supply could make that much effect if anyone could please answer that would be grate thanks </s>
<s> when i looked here i would say check to see if you installed the drivers and also check the connection where the power supply connects to the card </s>
<s> the last picture on the right shows where that extra power connection is if that is all ok then i would try talking to the place you purchsed the card </s>
<s> it could be that your psu is not adequate but i would think you would be having other problems also if the psu is overloaded </s>
<s> you have a different gpu chipset and from 512mb to 256mb ram difference expect a slight change in output </s>
<s> if the gpu box manual suggests a psu rating then you need that </s>
<s> of course be sure all the drivers etc </s>
<s> are installed right </s>
<s> the old drivers as well should be removed before the new video card was installed it can cause conflict s </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> means you have to re install your games so that your games can setup for that new card </s>
<s> the different characteristics of different cards are setup in the software </s>
<s> you might want to even go to the microsoft website and download the latest directx after you put in the drivers for it i wouldn t even use the cd that came with it </s>
<s> i d just go to nvidia com and download the latest drivers from there </s>
<s> also i d check the bios and make sure the card is seated properly and plugged into the power supply </s>
<s> i got battle field 2 and that s a terrible game imho </s>
<s> call to duty 2 is way better </s>
<s> and now there s a call to duty 3 </s>
