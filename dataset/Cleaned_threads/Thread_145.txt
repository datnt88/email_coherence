<s> quot the msi states that it must be a 1 5v card are all agp 4x cards 1 5 volt quot no </s>

<s> it s very confusing to most that the agp voltage is not set by the motherboard but by the card you put in </s>
<s> and there are keys in the slots to stop you from plugging in an incompatible card </s>
<s> sorry but i decline to re explain this further </s>

<s> i noted the keys to stop you from plugging in a card that won t be compatible </s>
<s> what more could we need to know </s>
<s> just noticed you were my lecturer at wiltshire college d yeah </s>
