<s> as the title suggested </s>
<s> how do you achieve optimal hard drive parition </s>
<s> or what do you think is the best way to achieve it </s>
<s> for me i use partition magic but i am not sure if it is the best and whether i doing the right way with it </s>
<s> it depends on what how you want to partition </s>
<s> for creating new partitions including logical ones i use window s disk management and that has never gone wrong for me </s>
<s> however if i want to do more of the complex stuff that partition magic offers merge partitions rename a partition redistribute free space resize etc </s>
<s> i would use that </s>
<s> oh and for installing a new os even though pm offers that i don t use it i like doing it the conventional way </s>
<s> but if you like it use it </s>
<s> i m just stating my opinion </s>
<s> is there an optimal way to partition a hard drive </s>
<s> in general or in any particular situation like quot tell me the details of your pc and what you do with it and i ll tell you the optimal configuration for that machine quot </s>
<s> if there isn t the only possible answer to your question is that it is an question without an answer </s>
<s> something like quot how do i walk to the moon quot or even quot how do i reach the end of the rainbow quot </s>
<s> i think for most of us one partition per drive is optimal </s>
<s> and that s easy to achieve the first time you use it </s>
<s> no magic needed </s>
<s> kees </s>
