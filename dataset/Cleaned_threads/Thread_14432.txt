<s> sorry to repeat this issue but have read through previous discussions and am still unclear what to buy and do </s>
<s> i am square one except i got a new laptop </s>
<s> i have a pc at home connected to a comcast cable modem </s>
<s> house is 3000 square feet i have a new power book g4 i would like to use all over house </s>
<s> 1 any cheap fast routers that could cover my house for the mac </s>
<s> 2 i would like to leave the pc hardwired and not wireless </s>
<s> 3 how to setup </s>
<s> 1 does your desktop already have a network card ethernet card 2 make sure your powerbook g4 already have a wireless capability have a wireless card read the manual 3 you need a accesspoint router the most common is an access point with 4 port router many brand you can choose from i e </s>
<s> apple linksys d link netgear belkin 3com just to name a few 4 you may need a repeater or range expander to cover the house </s>
<s> accesspoint can be use as a repeater look while you are looking for the accesspoint above 5 of course you will need a network cable basic setting or connection is cable modem gt gt accesspoint router gt pc and wireless laptop place that accesspoint router as close as possible to the center area where you will be using your laptop remember you need to connect the accesspoint router and your desktop to the cable modem using a cable hardwired if you still have not enough range coverage then you need a repeater range expander which should be placed somewhere in the middle in between your accesspoint and the outer range of your area </s>
<s> accesspoint repeater range expander farthest distance you need </s>
<s> accesspoint not here not here farthest distance you need </s>
<s> after that you need to configure and update your accesspoint router firmware </s>
<s> don t forget to secure your wireless by enabling the wep wpa or wpa2 which ever available and use mac filtering </s>
<s> for detail configuration you would be better to search google for it or maybe ask this forum later on when you are ready </s>
<s> m thank you for your detailed answer </s>
<s> i understand the flow of how the connections need to be made </s>
<s> as to the products themselves can you recommend one that is cheap but fast and reliable for apple </s>
<s> do i need to worry that it is an apple and should get airport express or does that not matter </s>
<s> how about how many ports does the router need and speed and reliability </s>
<s> again many thanks for your time </s>
<s> ca </s>
<s> as for what product to recommend i can not recommend any product but i use linksys wireless router 54g and i also have two mac laptop in my network they work as it should by the way i also use airport express as my repeater range expander </s>
<s> fastest and cheapest </s>
<s> speed will be determine by the current standard which is 54mbps line of sight and interference around it can decrease the speed and range prize are almost the same but please note that apple product are more expensive than non apple product </s>
<s> a router is use to connect your devices so how many port you need depends on your network the more devices means more port </s>
<s> the most common router have 4 port usually 1 for wan connection where your broadband modem connect to </s>
<s> look at linksys com or other brand website and see for yourself you ll find wireless accesspoint wireless accesspoint router range expander router switch etc </s>
<s> my entire house is apple </s>
<s> at first i wanted to go quot cheap quot dont try that trust me </s>
<s> we bought a linksys wireless router at first but it was terrible the reception was poor and several times a day it would freeze </s>
<s> my inlaws who use pc s have the same problem </s>
<s> we returned the equipment and decided to cough up the money on the apple airport extreme router </s>
<s> the best money we have ever spent </s>
<s> the reception is great and not only that it will support pc s too </s>
<s> our house is 3500 sq ft and it works great except for one of our bathrooms </s>
<s> for a while </s>
<s> i just recently purchaced the airport express and basicaly set it up to where it acts as a repeater so it expanded my coverage to where it works all over my back yard and now the upstairs bathroom gets full signal </s>
<s> i only bought it so the kids and i could use a printer upstairs instead of printing and runing downstairs to get our print out </s>
<s> another cool thing about the express is that it has a port on the side to plug your stereo into it and wirelesly stream your music from any computer to your stereo </s>
<s> if you have a new laptop chances are that you already have a wireless card if you are unsure just click on the apple icon in the top left and select quot about this mac quot then click on quot more info quot and select airport card </s>
<s> trust me you need to use an apple product you wont be disapointed </s>
<s> i m by no means a wireless expert but i switched from my linksys to the airport express recently </s>
<s> i wasn t able to get video ichat to work with the linksys and of course the ae lets me use my isight camera </s>
<s> well i ve got my studio about 35 feet from my bedroom where i ve got my ae taped up high on a window so i can get reception in the other building </s>
<s> not the best arrangement </s>
<s> i heard about wds which allows ae or another airport extreme base station to act as another remote access point thereby extending the range of my wireless </s>
<s> i don t have another ae but i have my old linksys wrieless router </s>
<s> i nosed around on the web and found this blog that looks terrific </s>
<s> this afternoon i m going to attempt to make the linksys act as my repeater or the ae act as one </s>
<s> whatever i can get to work </s>
<s> another little tidbit do a google search on macstumbler and download this little piece of software that will show what your actual signal strength is throughout your wireless network </s>
<s> since i m new to wireless i ll really be interested to hear how your dilemma plays out </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> phil </s>
<s> i would recommend getting a wireless router with mimo </s>
<s> this technology is a little more expensive than a typical wireless g router it provides better range and speed </s>
<s> by purchasing a router that provides better range than older routers you should be able to avoid the expense and complexity of a reapeater </s>
<s> i am using a belkin wireless g with mimo router placed in a corner of my 2800 square foot home and it works great with my g4 powerbook </s>
<s> i also have it connected to three windows machines via ethernet and one windows laptop via an internal card </s>
<s> you will want a router with sufficient ethernet ports to handle any computers that you want to connect via ethernet </s>
<s> you might also want to have an extra port or two in case you add a network attached server or a network printer </s>
<s> as a previous writer said do be sure to enable the security feature of your router </s>
<s> have fun </s>
