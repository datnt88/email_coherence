<s> hey guys i m trying to get a clear answer here so i hope you can help me </s>
<s> i m about to change from a past decade old 17 quot crt to an lcd for the first time </s>
<s> going to get a 19 standard this time around and when more applications support widescreen then i ll upgrade </s>
<s> for the moment though i know that the size of the lcd will give a 1280x1024 reso </s>
<s> i ve been told that lcd worked best on their native resolution and even though that is obvious i would like to know how it responds to lower settings </s>
<s> i m an old school gamer </s>
<s> i play games like master of orion 2 and i still love my starcraft and diablo to name a few </s>
<s> how would these look on an lcd </s>
<s> i would be really disapointed in getting a screen that couldn t show some decently my all time fav games </s>
<s> if brand helps in this query </s>
<s> i m currently looking at the samsung 932bf and the lg l1900r both at 2ms and at 2000 1 and 3000 1 respectively of contrast ratio </s>
<s> thx </s>
<s> it works from 320x200 all the way up to it s native resolution </s>
<s> hope this answers that question </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that s great but how is the quality </s>
<s> working is fine but if the quality is unbearable that doesn t solve my issue </s>
<s> i expect a shot in quality but to a certain limit only </s>
<s> 19 quot lcds although not samsung but equal in the specs </s>
<s> two are wide screen the other is standard </s>
<s> you ll love yours </s>
<s> one thing you didn t mention is your video card </s>
<s> will it support the native resolution of the proposed lcd </s>
<s> the reason i ask is i recently purchased a 22 quot and was excited to hook it up </s>
<s> although my high end nvidia 256 meg video card supported a gazillion resolutions the specific native of the 22 quot was not listed </s>
<s> in tears i returned it </s>
<s> quality is a subjective item </s>
<s> here it looks exactly as i expect a 320x200 or such display to look like </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the card is an nvidia 8600gts </s>
<s> this may vary by os </s>
<s> if i r c the desktop select properties settings i find a slider </s>
<s> it s my res adjuster </s>
<s> as i move the slider left right i think it s trying to tell me what res my vid card can handle </s>
<s> perhaps worth a look to see if the s match </s>
<s> i m well familiar with resolutions </s>
<s> but the specific one for that monitor was not listed </s>
<s> i could set it a little below and the picture specifically text was not good </s>
<s> above the native and i got the screen message quot out of range quot </s>
<s> well i finally took the plunged and aquired last night the samsung i had mentioned </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> talk about an improvement </s>
<s> i m still tweaking the settings but already i am impressed </s>
<s> after much research my fears about how older games would look like had abated a bit </s>
<s> i loaded up master of orion 2 and found out that i could play with native resolution by quot changing quot it to what was required for me to play 640x480 for this game </s>
<s> i m not sure if that is standard but my video card allowed me this </s>
<s> it looks a tad bit soft but its nothing major </s>
<s> came with a dvi corde so i was all set </s>
<s> yay </s>
