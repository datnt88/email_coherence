<s> hi i have a pc with the following spec windows vista home premium 32 bit intel g33m motherboard 500 watts ps intel core 2 duo e6550 2 33ghz 2 x 1gb patriot pc 6400 ram 800mhz geforce 8800gt oc wd 500gb hard i know that he maximum supported ram is 8gb on my pc i currently have 2 gb in dual channel and i notice vista is a bit slow on startup </s>
<s> will i see a performance increase if i upgrade to 3gb </s>
<s> what if i upgrade my ram to 8gb by adding 2 more 2gb ram sticks </s>
<s> will having unused ram decrease my pc performance </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> upgrading to 3gb i m told i use xp should be plenty for vista </s>
<s> anything after that would not be recognized by your computer once fully booted up but it can still be used you ll see it if you go into your bios </s>
<s> extra ram will never decrease your performance </s>
<s> although your pc can handle 8gb vista 32bit will only be able to address 4gb and only 3gb or so will be useable </s>
<s> slow startup is usually caused by crapware or uneeded apps </s>
<s> run windows defender and use its quot software explorer quot feature to see what s running currently and what runs automatically at startup </s>
<s> get rid of software you don t use and don t allow products like quicktime and acrobat to put their helpers in the startup group </s>
<s> read this posting for more info </s>
<s> startup performance </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> that s not the problem </s>
<s> 2g is more than enough memory for a bootup </s>
<s> if the bootup is slow look for some other cause like running processes </s>
<s> turn off quiktime real player printer programs that load on startup etc </s>
