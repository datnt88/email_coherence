<s> i ve received alot of great help here and i m hoping you can do it again </s>
<s> i live in a long ranch house </s>
<s> on one end i have my desktop computer and a netgear wndr3300 wireless router </s>
<s> in another room approximately 70 feet away is another desktop computer that is not near a cable jack so i m using a d link airpremier dwl g550 pci card with antenna to connect to the internet </s>
<s> the connection is so so and reception depends on the placement of the antenna </s>
<s> approximately 20 feet further away is a wii which cannot detect the wireless signal </s>
<s> i would like to replace the router with one that has a stronger signal that is able to reach the 90 feet necessary to establish good connections to the computer and wii </s>
<s> are newer routers able to dependably cover long distances </s>
<s> most usually have disclaimers about walls building materials etc </s>
<s> what i don t want is to buy a new router and spend several hours setting it up only to find that it s no better than the one i have now </s>
<s> i was looking at the asus rt n56u model </s>
<s> i would appreciate any opinions on this or other models that would solve my problem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> all router quot power quot is limited but the fcc so no router is more powerful than the next </s>
<s> i will write the dwl g550 is a card that was indeed so so and using another antenna helped </s>
<s> this is why we have other solutions like moving the router to a central location or using a second router as a wap </s>
<s> sorry but the answer is no </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok now that we know that routers don t have quot more power quot or vary greatly in distance what can we do </s>
<s> 1 location location location there are many that for whatever reason will not place the router in the central location or worse in the basement </s>
<s> these folk are best left alone to let them buy enough routers until it sinks in </s>
<s> this is not mean at all </s>
<s> it s how many folk learn </s>
<s> 2 with location our of the way the basic settings are covered in the cnet forums often </s>
<s> let s repeat them </s>
<s> router defaults except for what the isp wants </s>
<s> then we change the ssid to simple things </s>
<s> short is good </s>
<s> never hide the ssid and switch to wpa2 aes psk wpa if your gear does not do wpa2 </s>
<s> finally we may change the channel </s>
<s> 3 no 2 4ghz cordless phones allowed </s>
<s> hope this helps bob </s>
<s> 1 i cannot centralize the router </s>
<s> my office is where it is and cannot be moved </s>
<s> 2 if all routers are distance limited then why if i do a network search does the computer pick up signals sometimes moderately strong from the neighbors routers which are certainly more than 100 feet away </s>
<s> 3 i ve heard about gizmos you can buy that you place in other parts of the house that boost the router s signal so you can cover more distance </s>
<s> do these things work </s>
<s> 4 my phones are panasonic dect 6 0 </s>
<s> item 2 can be rough on folk but let s try </s>
<s> you know how light bounces off mirrors and walls </s>
<s> you get dark and light spots </s>
<s> the same is true with rf </s>
<s> it s not an even distribution and a spot could be better because of a bounce or other reflection </s>
<s> 3 gizmos </s>
<s> i never use them </s>
<s> i use well worn solutions such as quot how to use a router as a wap quot google that since it s cheap effective and i am sure of what it does and the boost in the coverage </s>
<s> no gizmos </s>
<s> in short i can use a 25 to 50 foot ethernet cable to my router as a wap towards the spot that isn t so hot and i ve good </s>
<s> if the ethernet cable is verboten i can use a powerline bridge to the router as a wap </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> due to bob s replies i did google research on waps which led to repeaters and wireless range extenders </s>
<s> i read reviews on many of these mostly netgear linksys and d link and most got many bad comments </s>
<s> i was ready to give up when i ran across a relatively new model by diamond the wr300n </s>
<s> it had almost uniformly good reviews so i decided to try it out </s>
<s> it took me about 15 minutes to set it up and i m glad to report that it works like a charm </s>
<s> i plugged it in about 50 feet from my router and now both the desktop computer and wii at the other end of the house have strong wireless signals </s>
<s> if you can t move your router or use a router as a wap i suggest trying out this product </s>
