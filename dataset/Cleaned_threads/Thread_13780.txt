<s> i have a dell xps 400 new in 2005 that was shipped with an ati radeon x300 se 128mb hypermemory video card </s>
<s> it is incapable of showing my hd videos from my new 18 megapixel canon camera without the image quot jumping quot or quot stuttering quot on the screen </s>
<s> i want to purchase a new video card that will perform better and that my dell machine will be capable of using </s>
<s> i am currently running windows xp media edition version 2002 with sp 3 but i plan on upgrading to windows 7 professional after installing a new video card </s>
<s> the processor is an intel pentium iv 3 0 ghz with 4gb of ram </s>
<s> can someone please recommend a good to high quality video card for me to purchase </s>
<s> you ve got a 375watt power supply that should be able to handle these cards </s>
<s> radeon hd 5750 about 155 radeon hd 5670 abut 110 geforce gts 240 about 110 but your power supply is 5 years old </s>
<s> it may not hold up well with a hd 5750 due to it s age </s>
<s> i also don t think the power supply can handle a gts 250 about 140 because they draw too much power </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
