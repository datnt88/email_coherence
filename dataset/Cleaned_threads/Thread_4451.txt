<s> okay i ve had it with my epson c80 and i m looking for a new printer starting from scratch </s>
<s> the epson self destructed because i didn t use it enough and it s design is as bad as its inks are good </s>
<s> clearly print quality alone epson would be it imho </s>
<s> however i m now taking two other points into consideration ink economy and maintenance </s>
<s> i want a printer that doesn t jam easily and i m looking at the canon pixma ip4000 </s>
<s> of course i m also open to anything else that gets a strong thumbs up so recommendations would be appreciated </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> an epson c80 would be some number of years old </s>
<s> if you feel that printers should last longer than what s on the ink printer market today is not worthy of your desires </s>
<s> i d look at color laser since it does not have an ink drying issue and i m getting 5 years from such in office settings </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but you can t get photo quality or anything even near from a color laser can you </s>
<s> we have a high priced one at work and the output looks terrible </s>
<s> there are no subtleties in color and the color overlapping is just a tiny bit off </s>
<s> given the design problems of the c80 do you think the canon would be any better </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> the models you ve noted last for just a few years </s>
<s> you want more </s>
<s> while the laser you have doesn t do photo the current class of lasers is much better and doesn t have the ink drying issue or the short 2 to 3 year lifespan </s>
<s> there was not a design problem in the c80 </s>
<s> but you wanted something like a refrigerator </s>
<s> something that just works for 7 plus years </s>
<s> again any consumer ink printer will not satisfy what i ve read in your postings </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi confed i am a printer engineer and think that your office kit needs calibrating the output is usually pretty good </s>
<s> i don t like canon inkjets partly because if there is a quality problem and you remove the ink cartridge it can take up to 10 cleaning cycles with the wastage that entails to get it to print again </s>
<s> i much prefer hp or lexmark </s>
<s> bear in mind that due to the nature of my job i only see the problem kit and i see far more canons </s>
