<s> i m looking at getting a core i7 920 and i wondering if anybody has already purchased one and if they could tell how well the stock heatsink fan work </s>
<s> i ve heard that they are terrible so i am just wondering </s>
<s> have been the best over the years </s>
<s> i think i ve replaced a few intel fans where as all the others are a daily replacement in the shop </s>

<s> if you plan to quot overclock quot then consider a higher rated or suitable replaceable fan that s rated for such use </s>
<s> in most cases just trust the supplied fan that came with the cpu </s>
