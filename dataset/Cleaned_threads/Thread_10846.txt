<s> i have an olevia 27 inch monitor tv </s>
<s> i have it connected to my hp media center m7360n via the vga connection and it works perfectly well </s>
<s> on black friday i decided to get a bigger monitor tv but i am cheap so i bought the emerson 32 inch that wal mart had on sale for 388 and then gave my old tv to my roommate </s>
<s> i thought i was getting a good deal however now maybe not </s>
<s> the problem is my pc has no hdmi port and the new tv has no vga port </s>
<s> i tried connecting them using rca cables with no luck </s>
<s> i think that problem lies with the pc as the dvd player connected to the new tv with no problem </s>
<s> my question is do i have to buy a new computer with an hdmi slot or is it possible to upgrade my existing computer </s>
<s> i would appreciate any help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> here is my suggestion just get a vga to hdmi cable and hook it up and you should be good they are only like 6 00 so it isn t a pricey fix just run to fry s or get on online i hope this helps </s>
<s> i ve never done this with vga to hdmi to a tv but i did this with a dvi to vga to a regular monitor </s>
<s> two possible fixes </s>
<s> find an adapter that matches your needs the cheap fix or buy a new video card </s>
<s> if video card you need to disable the on board video install new card with required ports and s w to finish install </s>
<s> being a media center system may complicate things imho </s>
<s> of course you can google away for others that may have fixed a similar issue </s>
<s> believe me this hd tv stuff is getting popular but attaching to old systems can be a no go w o added attention or expense </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
