<s> i have 2 desktops and a inspiron 8200 on my network </s>
<s> the desktops are connected via a nic and the inspiron via belkin pre n card </s>
<s> a belkin pre n router connects them all </s>
<s> it seems i m having trouble with the inspiron s wireless connection </s>
<s> i have internet access i can print to other printers on the desktops and i setup quickbooks to access the file on a desktop </s>
<s> however the inspiron can t see the desktops in workgroup computers can t access the shared files that show up in my network and it doesn t show up in the desktops workgroup computers </s>
<s> the desktops can t print to the inspiron s printer </s>
<s> all this happens with all firewalls disabled </s>
<s> how can i get full access with all the computers </s>
<s> win xp thank you </s>
<s> and see if both have same workgroup name and turn on files and printer sharing </s>
<s> try also to disable the firewall </s>
<s> thanks for your suggestion </s>
<s> all have the same workgroup and have file printer sharing installed </s>
<s> not only did i disable the firewall i uninstalled trend micro pc cillin you should uninstall any 3rd party software not just disable it as i was told on all the computers and rebooted them </s>
<s> now all 3 computers are visible in workgroup computers on all computers however the wireless xp home dell only shows the dell s shared folders </s>
<s> the xp pro shuttle and the xp home gateway hard wired nic s shows each others shared folders but not the dell s </s>
<s> getting closer </s>
