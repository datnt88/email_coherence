<s> hey guys my 250 gb hard drive looks like it s nearly running out of space and i figured i would go out and buy a new one </s>
<s> the thing is i m split between internal and external </s>
<s> i have a relatively fast desktop computer with 3 sata 2 connectors so internal sounds like a clean invisible fit </s>
<s> however they aren t portable </s>
<s> what i wanted to know was which one had better seek time </s>
<s> durability </s>
<s> and similar pros and cons of each </s>
<s> another thing that i wanted to know about was raid </s>
<s> will raid enable both of my hard drives to work as one </s>
<s> and are there different types of raid or does every motherboard have the same compatibility </s>
<s> my last question was that some of the external hard drives that i ve seen had rj 45 connectors on them </s>
<s> this would be really handy because i m planning on buying a laptop soon and this would be handy </s>
<s> but do you guys recommend this over networking my router </s>
<s> any other info or personal details will really be appreciated too </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> because i bought an external usb 2 0 case and used my selection of drives </s>
<s> parting hint they don t use different model drives in those ready to use externals than what you find internally </s>
<s> the downside to external is the transfer speed is slower </s>
<s> yes someone will note esata but many fail to get it to work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> 250gb hdd fails </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
