<s> hi i am for sure getting the e8500 core 2 duo cpu and later planning on getting a radeon 4890 the cpu is very nice but i m wondering if it would bottleneck the card at all and if so to what degree </s>
<s> i m also planning on getting a new 750 watt psu at the same time as the card and my current system also has 4 gigs only 3 3 usable from vista 32 bit of 667 ram </s>
<s> any estimations would be appreciated thanks in advance </s>
<s> unless you re doing video editting or some 3d ray tracing the e8500 has plenty of compute power </s>
<s> i agree with the previous poster </s>
<s> keep in mind that e8500 3 16 ghz can outperform many quad cores in single and dual threaded applications because of the higher processor frequency </s>
<s> good purchase </s>
