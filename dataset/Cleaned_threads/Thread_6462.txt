<s> ok so here s my problem </s>
<s> i m home from school and for some reason or other my laptop will not connect to the internet </s>
<s> i was home for thanksgiving break and it was working fine </s>
<s> it seems to be working fine now aside from it not connecting to the internet </s>
<s> my wireless signal is as strong as can be and it connects to the router but when i open ie it wont connect to the internet </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea what could be wrong or how i could fix it </s>
<s> to the router then open internet explorer and click on tools and click on online </s>
<s> then try it </s>
<s> if it does not work try a different browser to make sure you really are connected </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>

<s> yeah it says that its connected to the wireless router i ve tried disconnecting and re connecting but it still says its not connected to the internet </s>
<s> i can t get on aim or anything but the signal strenght is strong and it says its connected to the wireless router i dunno </s>
<s> i think most probably you are not connecting to wireless router although the signal is strong </s>
<s> check out this link to confirm your wireless adapter configuration if still having problem use ping to troubleshoot the problem </s>
<s> i had that problem twice with me sony viao </s>
<s> i was using norton antivirus software somehow a glich would occur in my security settings and block my access to the wireless internet connection </s>
<s> i had to go into norton and change my settings </s>
<s> also if you are running windows xp and those security settings are set to high that might also block you from the internet </s>
