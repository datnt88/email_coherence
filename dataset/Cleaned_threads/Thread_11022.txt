<s> i have had a netgear wgr614v7 for about 18 months </s>
<s> attached to it was a mac laptop leopard ibm desktop windows xp a hp printer and a lenovo laptop vista </s>
<s> the desktop and printer were wired with the mac and thinkpad operating wirelessly </s>
<s> this past week the router went bad the cable company verified that it was the issue so i bought a new wgr6214v10 </s>
<s> i installed it and everything works as expected except the lenovo laptop </s>
<s> if i connect the ethernet cable to the laptop it works fine but it will not work wirelessly </s>
<s> i have spent some time with a technical guy who could not find the problem and suspected that my norton anti virus might be the culprit </s>

<s> i am not a computer maven but this sounds a bit like quot get it off my plate and go somewhere else quot do any of you experts have any suggestions or should i try another brand of router </s>
<s> 1 try it setup the forum s advised way </s>
<s> see top of the forum defaults wpa etc </s>
<s> 2 another post had them tinker with the mtu down to 1400 but it has been years since i found that tweak needed </s>
<s> might be making a comeback </s>
