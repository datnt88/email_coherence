<s> hi all i ve recently bought a laptop and set up a wireless network at home </s>
<s> both computers connect smoothly and the pc can see the laptop s shared folders but the laptop can t see the pc s shared folders </s>
<s> any idea what might be wrong </s>
<s> both computers run xp both have home networking enabled with the same workgroup name </s>
<s> my suspicion is on the firewalls i have the laptop running norton s personal firewall where i ve set up the router address as a trusted computer </s>
<s> but does that open me up to all internet traffic </s>
<s> the pc is running windows firewall </s>
<s> file and printer sharing are excepted from the firewall but i still can t see the laptop and don t see any other place to specify the workgroup or laptop to allow traffic </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas </s>
<s> i m out of em </s>
<s> thanks beth </s>
<s> try access home pc from laptop using its ip lt sharedfolder gt type the shared folder you know </s>
<s> i was also having same problem </s>
<s> i wasn t able to see homepc in the network neighbourhood then </s>
<s> i guess this is the way i resolved it before </s>
<s> uninstall the network from laptop and resetup the network by using your xp cd </s>
<s> if not then uninstall the network completely from all the devices and install by the one xp cd in all divices </s>
<s> is the pc xp home or xp pro </s>
<s> this is too much for me to get into here but basically you want to create an account for the laptop on your desktop pc </s>
<s> setup an account on the pc for the laptop example laptop give the account a password </s>
<s> setup a user account on the laptop called laptop and give it the same password as the account on the pc </s>
<s> from the pc you will need to give laptop permission to access the folders in question </s>
<s> that s all i can really get into online </s>
<s> if you need help invite your local 7 year old over for milk and cookies </s>

<s> remember you have to enable file print sharing on both the laptop and desktop in order to share both ways </s>
<s> if you only ran the network setup wizard on the laptop your desktop is not setup properly for sharing </s>
