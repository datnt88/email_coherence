<s> i have an inspiron 1525 it boots up and then my wallpaper comes up and covers my desk top that has the start button icons ect </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> what if you set the wallpaper to none </s>

<s> set the wallpaper to none </s>

<s> thanks for responding </s>
<s> i can t get to anything because everything is covered by the wallpaper </s>
<s> i need for the wallpaper to go away so i can get to the start button icons ect </s>
<s> any more suggestions </s>
<s> then a right click on the desktop would let me set the wallpaper </s>
<s> sorry but i have to disagree with you about the wallpaper covering the icons </s>
<s> i think the machine has the usual malware damage </s>
<s> repairs vary with the user s skill level </s>
<s> i see you posted in the newbie forum so i m guessing you don t do a lot of pc repairs </s>
<s> here s an article so you can get your files out of the machine then restore the pc to its factory issued os quot load quot </s>
<s> gt read this article works for xp vista 7 and 8 bob </s>
<s> i ve tried right clicking and nothing happens </s>
<s> duplication of effort </s>
<s> locking this one </s>
<s> please continue in the newbies forum </s>
<s> however i m getting the feeling this is your first encounter with a balky machine </s>
