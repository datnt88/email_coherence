<s> i ve built a number of pcs without ever experiencing this common problem here s what happened and how i fixed it </s>
<s> i built a micro atx machine for my wife all moderate components </s>
<s> i researched their power requirements and figured a 150 watt antec power supply should do the job </s>
<s> after installing win 2k i always install chipset drivers first then zonealarm then norton av and hit the net for updates </s>
<s> when i tried to open ie spontaneous crash reboot </s>
<s> hmmm </s>
<s> after several repeats i booted into safe mode all was well but when i booted normally and tried to run an app the crashes returned </s>
<s> figuring the machine was underpowered i schlepped off to fry s to get a 350w atx psu </s>
<s> after shoehorning it into the case imagine my surprise when the same incident occurred </s>
<s> i had purchased the mobo with the cpu installed and figured the assembler might have messed up the install but before i went to that extreme there was a piece of tape saying warranty void if removed i re traced my steps and realized my problems started when i installed nav </s>
<s> i re booted into safe mode removed norton and voila </s>
<s> problem solved </s>
<s> i re installed norton and updated machine ran sisoft sandra s burn in routine with no problems </s>
<s> i guess there was some conflict between zonealarm and norton or just a bad software install for whatever reason </s>
<s> i ve heard of bad drivers bad psus bad cpu installation causing this problem never a bad install of software </s>
<s> keep this info in the back of your head for the future </s>
