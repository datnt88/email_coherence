<s> what is the difference in the speed of sata compared to ata raid 0 </s>
<s> which one of the two is faster </s>
<s> also which of the two is the most cost effective solution of the two options </s>
<s> i would also get a motherboard that would support either of the two because i am planning on building my own gaming machine </s>
<s> if you look at you find that sata and pata can be for arguments sake speed equivilent </s>
<s> raid on either would have to be benchmarked </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sata is the means by which the hard drive connects to the computer </s>
<s> raid redundant array of independant disks was originally a security backup device using multiple identical hard drives </s>

<s> raid 0 changes this a bit however </s>
<s> it takes 2 drives and creates a single drive </s>
<s> not unlike dual channel memory </s>
<s> it nearly double the rate that data can be both read and written </s>
<s> it requires a special controller that is either built into the motherboard or can come as a seperate controller card </s>
