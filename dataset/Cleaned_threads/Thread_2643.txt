<s> buying a new mid range desktop later this week </s>
<s> haven t decided on whether to buy one off gateway s web site velocity micro s site or just go to best buy and make the purchase </s>
<s> i chose gateway and velocity for there customer service and quality of systems </s>
<s> most reviews on them seem to be good </s>
<s> i know you can customize if you buy from thier web sites but that is the only advantage i see so far </s>
<s> gateway velocity or best buy store </s>
<s> your opinions please </s>
<s> after many looksee s i wonder if they have nothing but older models or units they bought a boatload of </s>
<s> if you go that route get the make model and go back home to research that model and see if it s been superseded or you can beat it by going direct </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the retail versions of gateways are technically not as good as those offered direct from gateway </s>
<s> the retail pcs use more low end components lower rated power supplies ddr2 533 vs ddr2 667 ram i945 instead of i965 chipset etc </s>
<s> but the prices of the retail units are hard to beat 749 for a core2duo 2gb ram and 320gb hd </s>
<s> i ordered one from vm last week after doing much research </s>
<s> i had originally ordered one to be customized from hp </s>
<s> i also ordered a monitor from them </s>
<s> i got the monitor actually 2 and since both were defective i cancelled my order after spending about 4 hours on the phone with their quot tech support quot </s>
<s> arrgh </s>
<s> i think the deciding factor for buying a vm was this article </s>
<s> i thought it was very helpful good luck </s>
