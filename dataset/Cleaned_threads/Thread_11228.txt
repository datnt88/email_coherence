<s> i have a d link wbr 1310 router and everytime the phone rings and is picked up my internet connection becomes unplugged </s>
<s> i am new with routers cox cable says it s the router </s>
<s> has anyone any information on the set up that would have caused this to happen </s>
<s> it s very frustrating </s>
<s> remember i am a rookie too </s>
<s> that becomes unplugged i would guess both the router and the phone are operating within the same frequency range </s>
<s> try moving the base stations further apart and change the channel that the router operates on </s>
<s> thanks i will try that </s>
<s> not sure how to change the channel on the router but will get the book out </s>
<s> thanks again for your help </s>
<s> i changed the channel two times and it still is doing it </s>
<s> my digital phone connection is close to my router so i suppose maybe a different phone on a different mgz speed might help </s>
<s> you have tried moving the two further apart </s>
<s> the house is wired close so i can t move it any farther </s>
<s> do you think a different router or phone mghz would help </s>
<s> i could buy a new phone </s>
<s> i have a netgear router i could hook up that is a wg102 model </s>
<s> thanks for all of your help </s>
<s> it s much appreciated </s>
<s> go for the phone change </s>
