<s> my cd rom in my laptop is not registering and i can t add one in new hardware </s>
<s> win98 was installed with this drive so i know it worked </s>
<s> i have checked to make sure it is securely attached </s>
<s> it spins when i put a disk in but no recognition </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> quot win98 was installed with this drive so i know it worked quot you may have left out part of the story </s>
<s> was this install recent </s>
<s> if so did you install some os other than what came with the laptop </s>
<s> if so you then have to install what motherboard or ide drivers this laptop requires </s>
<s> this is true for desktops as well but in laptops they usually supply a restore cd that does it all for you </s>
<s> when a person installs the windows os from microsoft they learn about drivers other items are set the ide controller to both in device manager no cdrom items are allowed in config sys or the cdrom will vanish </s>
<s> test the cdrom with a bootable cd or with a combo of boot diskette and cd </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks yes to recent install yes to new os 95 to 98se </s>
<s> i have tried reinstalling win98 with a boot disk and got no drives found when it wanted cdrom support </s>
<s> i attempted to load drivers screwed up config sys had to go back into dos to change back to previous config bak not a skilled worker here </s>
<s> microsoft does not install these for you </s>
<s> you may have to fish around the toshiba web site for them </s>
<s> be sure to check that setting both in the ide controller device manager as well as sharing the content of config sys bob </s>
