<s> is there a dvd writer you would recommend </s>
<s> at the office we use generic names like teac liteon sony lg and more </s>
<s> we pay from 39 to 99 bucks for the drives and use software such as cdburnerxp or other titles </s>

<s> some want to analyze the makes models until they find the best solution </s>
<s> we can t do that so we buy it install it and start using it </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
