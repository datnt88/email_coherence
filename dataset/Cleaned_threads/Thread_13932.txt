<s> also i would considering getting the nvidia 6800gs instead for the gfx card </s>
<s> also the ram isnt very good </s>
<s> i would get something from ocz or corsair xms but i m not sure about your budget also u can skimp down on the cpu </s>
<s> go with the 3000 venice core </s>
<s> 3200 is not that much of a boost </s>
<s> also i dont think the sound card is necessary </s>
<s> and i never heard of the company of your psu b4 </s>
<s> but other than that pretty good </s>
<s> and depending on the price of the mobo u could change it to something from asus msi or dfi </s>
<s> all of those are good </s>
<s> others which are pretty good would be epox chaintech abit etc </s>
<s> but the gigabyte one would be good </s>
<s> i would look into a better psu a dvd rom or media card reader </s>
<s> don t forget extra fans for cooling windows and arctic silver 5 if you don t have windows cd but oem or layman if you have a store bought windows computer s hard drive </s>
