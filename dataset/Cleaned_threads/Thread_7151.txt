<s> i want to hide everything that can be used to find the location of my internet connection </s>
<s> in order to do that i m planning to use ultrasurf hotspot shield smac or any program to change my mac address and maybe putty </s>
<s> the only problem is that i need to know how i can combine these programs </s>
<s> i need to know if there is a program that can take a proxy address like ultrasurf and let me select which program will run with it </s>
<s> this would be very helpful because in that way i do not to change the configuration of mozilla firefox or ie every time i use them and it also allow me to use ultrasurf in programs that don t have an option to set up a proxy </s>
<s> the program that most closely would fulfill my needs is gtunnel but for some reason did not work on windows vista and it did not shows all my programs </s>
<s> do you know any program like this </s>
<s> any suggestion on how to hide my location </s>
<s> please do not tell me this question is illegal because it s not </s>
<s> i do not plan to do anything wrong with this </s>
<s> the reason is simple </s>
<s> if you were hidden internet traffic would not make it to your machine </s>
<s> this is just like hiding your mail box and asking for the mail to be delivered to your secret location </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> first i assume you are going to pay for a service </s>
<s> the only way to do this is to make all your traffic appear to come from another machine </s>
<s> that other machine someone has to pay for </s>
<s> there are some free services out there but you will have to search </s>
<s> the simplest and the one that will bypass just about any firewall or proxy is ssl vpn </s>
<s> because this uses the same protcol as https sesions it is unlikely to be blocked </s>
<s> this is how the kids play world of warcraft at schools </s>
<s> the ssl vpn client itself generally does not need to be quot installed quot so it will run on even the most secure machines since most are java based </s>
<s> the next is a ipsec vpn </s>
<s> many small routers support this so you could use a friends house if they allow it </s>
<s> this is how we watch tv in other countries that have ip restrictions </s>
<s> any type of vpn is the best because it creates another interface on your machine </s>
<s> the application do not have to be reconfigured since they cannot tell if the port is a wireless ethernet vpn etc most the other solutions are a pain </s>
<s> you have to configure proxy which of course does not work for apps that want to use ports other than the standard ones </s>
<s> you can use ssh to build a sorta vpn tunnel but it is a pain but the way we used to do it years ago </s>
<s> be somewhat careful of what software you run </s>
<s> many things can get lots of information </s>
<s> google chrome has been blasted by many for the tracking info it sends keeps </s>
<s> it will at times even send the user id you are logged into </s>
