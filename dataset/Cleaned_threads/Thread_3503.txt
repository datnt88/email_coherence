<s> quick question i have a printer with a usb connection currently connected to my win xp desktop </s>
<s> i don t really care for the windows print feature on xp seems to be hit or miss with my other pcs on the network at times </s>
<s> i would like to know if i can connect the printer directly to the network router port </s>
<s> i understand there are usb to ethernet adapters will this assign an ip from the router that other pc s can use as a network printer or do i need to get a mini print server </s>
<s> also the printer port is the type b square usb connection while most convertors have a type a to lan </s>
<s> do they sell a type b unit </s>
<s> each device connected to a router must have a nic </s>
<s> does your printer have a nic </s>
<s> either the printer manufacturer offers an internal print server that you can install in the printer or you get to purchase a usb print server </s>
<s> usb a or b doesn t matter because you can purchase whatever cable you need </s>
<s> there are wired and wireless print server models </s>
<s> it s best to purchase a print server that is known to work with your printer model </s>
