<s> i have purchased two of the above monitors and have waited 4 months for my rebate </s>
<s> based on what i have read i guess i will never see it </s>
<s> as to the quality of the monitor it has performed without any problems for me and one other employee </s>
<s> i am not picky about how true the colors are so i cannot comment on that subject but functionally it has been fine </s>
<s> i have nothing to say that it is exceptional nor anything to say that is poor </s>
<s> rcs </s>
<s> i have the same monitor </s>
<s> it s a reasonable monitor excellent for price </s>
<s> i did wish it had some more options with regard to turning the monitor up and down and around but its been fine </s>
<s> i never recieved my rebate either which is highly dissapointing maybe this is an issue others are having </s>
<s> the monitor only have with one dead pixel which as i understand it is much less than the industry average </s>
<s> i m happy with it </s>
<s> if you want more reviews go to newegg com its been reveiwed hundred s of times </s>
<s> but i would absolutely not accept a monitor with any dead pixels </s>
<s> it just shouldnt happen </s>
<s> i once bought an lcd on the internet that had three </s>
<s> i returned it and the lady told me an lcd could have up to eight dead pixels </s>
<s> just ridiculous </s>
<s> now i have a samsung without a single dead pixel thank heavens </s>
<s> i once got a kodak digital camera that had a dead pixel on the screen </s>
<s> returned it for another </s>
<s> these items are not cheap and if you can find items without dead pixels why settle for one with them </s>
<s> im sorry about your pixel but if it were me i would zip the monitor back to where i bought without any hesitation </s>
<s> even exchange it rather than to settle for it </s>
<s> the rebate thing to </s>
<s> i mean id call the president of fuji if i had to </s>
<s> it used to be that the customer is always right </s>
<s> now we do the big boys a favor just buying from them </s>
<s> no respect for the purchaser anymore </s>
<s> cheap quality service and greed </s>
<s> monitors are good to buy at big box stores just for that very reason </s>
<s> id wear the place out if i had to to get satisfaction </s>
<s> well thats what happens when you buy a monitor from a company like fujiplus </s>
<s> i mean have you ever heard of fujiplus </s>
<s> my second monitor is a 20 quot hp lcd and i dont have one dead pixel </s>
<s> i think industry standard is that they will replace monitors if they have 6 dead pixels or more </s>
