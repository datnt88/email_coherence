<s> a lot of the cpus sold these days are of 64 bit </s>
<s> but are they of any help at all if i m still using 32 bit applications on a 32 bit os </s>
<s> and is there any point at all to go into 64 bit if i m using less than 4gb of ram </s>
<s> today the apps would run no faster if ported to 64 bit only </s>
<s> the rare exception will be noted here and there but for today you can do wonders with the 32 bit os 2 0gb ram and a better video card </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s a general argument that i ve heard from various sources that 64 bit won t become mainstream in quite some more years to come </s>
<s> if that s the case wouldn t it be more sensible to go down a grade and get a 32 bit cpu instead of a 64 bit </s>
<s> the core 2 duo gains over the core duo are such that you would get the c2d everytime </s>
<s> essentially you get em64t for free </s>
<s> but the real payoffs for many is the video card games </s>
<s> i have to stick with generic answers since we are not talking specifics here </s>
<s> specifics </s>
<s> mysql gets a speed boost from 64 bit </s>
<s> games in general get nothing but by curbing the cost of the usual 64 bit os and putting that into our video card we gain fps </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> even the 50 celeron e1200 is 64bit </s>
<s> so don t waste your time looking for a quot 32bit quot processor since they are all obsolete </s>
