<s> my friend has a samsung hd103uj hdd 1tb and he used it to put his pictures of family from russia his home country before upgrading his windows xp to 7 after the install he went to put the pictures back only to get a message telling him to reformat </s>

<s> he doesn t have money to spend on getting these pictures back so i was wondering i anyone knew of a way to get pictures from a hdd that isn t readable by windows xp or 7 without paying someone 800 </s>

<s> controllers are attached by connectors and are generally not soldered in place </s>
<s> but first i d try all the software solutions mentioned above until i was comfortable knowing that none of them worked </s>
<s> then i d freeze the drive in the deep freeze over night and try again before the drive warmed up </s>
