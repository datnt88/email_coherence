<s> i have a network setup in my house using a netgear 3500 wireless n router </s>
<s> i have a dell computer hooked to the router with a cat 6 cable and a hp printer hooked up with usb to that computer </s>
<s> i bought a new laptop with windows 7 and am trying to get that to be able to print wireless to the hp printer </s>
<s> i have followed the instructions from the microsoft site and can t get it to work </s>
<s> microsoft says it is possible so i must be missing something </s>
<s> i talked to a couple techs at bb who said they didn t think it would work because of the windows vista and windows 7 mix and advised me to buy a wireless print server </s>
<s> i could buy a wireless printer for a little more money than the print server but really don t want to spend the money right now unless absolutely necessary </s>
<s> my granddaughter uses the laptop for her school work and then we have to hookup the laptop to the printer to print things out which is a real pain </s>
<s> has anyone else on the forum run into this and if so how was it fixed </s>
<s> if it won t work i will bite the bullet and buy a wireless printer </s>
<s> thanks wayne </s>
<s> i have a network setup in my house using a netgear wireless n router </s>
<s> i have a new dell desktop with windows 7 hardwired to the router and a canon printer connected by usb to that computer </s>
<s> i have a laptop with vista and am trying to get that to to print wireless to the canon printer </s>
<s> when trying to print from the laptop i get a message which says that the print drivers can not be found on the laptop </s>
<s> do i need the drivers installed on the laptop if the print is connected to the desktop </s>
<s> i was thinking the same thing and loaded the drivers and software on the wireless laptop and still couldn t it to work </s>
<s> a friend of mine has the same router and printer setup i do and has no trouble at all getting his wireless laptop to print </s>
<s> the big difference is both his desktop and laptop are windows 7 home premium </s>
<s> it must be a problem with windows 7 and vista not working with each other causing the problem </s>
<s> the techs at bb said it wouldn t work but they were also trying to sell me either a wireless print server or wireless printer </s>
<s> i am going to another computer tech today that does this for his living and see what he says about it </s>
<s> will let you know what he says </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> contrary to what the bb and staples techs told me you can print wireless without the expense of added equipment </s>
<s> the tech yesterday told me it can be done and said i had it setup right but was leaving out one step the last one choosing the network named printer rather than local </s>
<s> if you go to microsoft support and follow the instructions closely on setting up your network it will work </s>
<s> wayne </s>
