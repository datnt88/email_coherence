<s> i need to buy a good gaming pc for myself </s>
<s> i will be playing games like battlefield 2 f e a r rainbow 6 las vegas and other awesome games like that </s>
<s> i cannot spend more than 1000 on this </s>
<s> all i want to know is what are the best things to get so i can get good memory a good video card and all that junk </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> i m really only a casual gamer </s>
<s> i will play rainbow 6 and battlefield mostly </s>
<s> i probably won t even have any other games on my computer </s>
<s> what i am looking for is basically an awesome pc that can handle those games easily so i don t get mad that it lags all the time </s>
<s> but along with that i don t need and won t spend money on the 4000 5000 pc s </s>
<s> how about the gateway fx530xm with intel core 2 duo processor e6600 2 40ghz 1066mhz fsb 4mb cache non ht 2048mb 667mhz dual channel ddr2 sdram 2 1024mb modules intel 975x chipset with ddr2 and intel core duo support 500gb 7200rpm serial ata ii 300 hard drive w 8mb cache raid 0 2 250gb hard drives and either one of these i can t decide on which one i actually need nvidia geforce 7600gt 256mb ddr2 video card dual dvi tv nvidia geforce 8800gts w 320mb dual dvi i dual link tv out factory overclocked w vga adapter </s>
<s> i know i said i don t want to spend more than 1000 but the reason i like the gateway is because i can get a computer from either gateway or dell for a little bit cheaper </s>
<s> so it would actually be a good price </s>
<s> gt the 8800 is noted </s>
<s> see how it fared </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> how about an xbox360 for 400 </s>
<s> you re looking at a 105 geforce 7600gt and a 285 8800gts </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> if the 8800gts fits in your budget get it because there s no other 300 card that can match its peformance </s>
<s> if you only have 200 get a radeon x1900xt </s>
<s> if only 160 its a tough call between a geforce 8600gts dx10 geforce 7900gs faster or radeon x1950pro fastest </s>
<s> don t put anything slower like a 7600gt in a new gaming rig </s>
<s> so your saying either the 8800gts or the radeon x1950pro </s>
<s> but if i want i can get the 7900 gs and still play my games without getting really mad cuz the frame rate sucks </s>
<s> but when i buy it from gateway com i have the choice between the 8800gts 299 00 or the ati radeon x1900 crossfire w 512 mb 357 00 nothing about 1950 pro it says crossfire and its an added 470 </s>
<s> so idk which one to get since i ve actually never used any of them b4 </s>
<s> all i want is to play a few games without getting any lag </s>
<s> thanks a lot by the way </s>
<s> really appreciate it </s>
<s> gateway offers a limited number of graphics upgrades but any of the cards i mentioned will work in the pc </s>
<s> gateway s price on the 8800gts is reasonable especially since they will pre install it for you </s>
<s> the x1900 crossfire won t match the all around performance of the 8800gts </s>
<s> as i said before if you don t have the budget for the 8800gts get what you can afford from the earlier list </s>
