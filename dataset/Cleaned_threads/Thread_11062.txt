<s> while trying to find and install a working driver for a dvd drive on windows 98 if that s even possible one program i tried screwed me over on both of my drives so now the computer will not detect either </s>
<s> i need firmware for both </s>
<s> the info i gathered on each ricoh company rw5125a dvd cdrw and hp cd writer plus 8000 series 4x2x20x ide hp c4465 56000 please help two drives down the drain really stinks i ll get more information or pictures if need be </s>
<s> what do u mean lose firmware firmware and driver are different i am thinking that the drivers are missing </s>
<s> give the spec of ur computer </s>
<s> if this is indeed an hp or compaq machine visit the site </s>
<s> what would be much easier would be go out and buy a new dvd burner drive </s>
<s> it is probably much faster at reading and burning disks than both of your drives and relatively inexpensive and easy to install </s>
<s> thanks for the advice i thought about just getting a new one but um yeah really weird story </s>
<s> you probably wont even believe it the computer is just sitting there turned on while im over here on this one and it just like turns off randomly </s>
<s> so i turn it back on and the drives work take note this is maybe the 8th or so time the computer has been restarted but now i need to find a driver for the ricoh </s>
<s> my problem was firmware and now its the driver </s>
<s> does the system see the compact disc drives during bootup </s>
<s> optical drive firmware start here </s>
<s> i solved the issue but thanks </s>
<s> i just need a driver now for the ricoh rw5125a </s>
<s> it didnt it would say they are incompatible on startup now i believe it does </s>
<s> but as cd rom s i need drivers for them </s>
<s> try here for latest </s>
<s> you ll need software to play movies or burn discs but no drivers </s>
<s> you didn t mention things like powerdvd cyberlink or nero so we don t know what you already have </s>
<s> chuck </s>
