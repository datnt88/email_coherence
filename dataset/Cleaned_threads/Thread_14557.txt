<s> anyone know where i can find a transformer for a set of logitech x540 speakers </s>
<s> logitech says they don t sell them </s>
<s> tiger direct and newegg are also no gos </s>
<s> and many other pictures do not show this component </s>
<s> my bet is you ll have to buy a second x540 off ebay </s>
<s> that s not a bad deal since power bricks could run that much </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> try going to radio shack see if there is a universal adapter kit that might work </s>
<s> the critical points are the input fitting size and dc voltage best to take them with if you decide to try this </s>
<s> oddly enough i had an old scanner laying around a while back and the inverter had gone south went to radio shack did a match up and it worked </s>
<s> just a thought </s>
<s> again the fitting and voltage dc are the critical issues </s>
