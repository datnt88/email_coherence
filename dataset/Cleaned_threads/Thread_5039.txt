<s> for christmas even though it is a little late i want to get a terabyte hard drive </s>
<s> it would be set up to be an external hard drive but i could purchase the 3 5 hdd and put it in a 1 tb enclosure </s>
<s> my past experience with external hard drives or individual hdds is that although a hard drive may be cheap and high capacity it could corrupt on you as easy as pie </s>
<s> while high end ones lower capacity but still can crap out on you as well but less likely to </s>
<s> 1 terabyte hard drive is an extreme high capacity hard drive so i want to be sure not to fall for them cheap and high capacity hdds but i lose all my data because it craps out on me </s>
<s> my question is what is a good hdd brand specifically for a terabyte that also won t break the bank but also will not crap out on me as well </s>
<s> thanks in advanced </s>
<s> then see what questions remain </s>
<s> my observation external hdds are generally much more susceptible vulnerable to problems and failure than internals </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> true single 1tb hds are not that plentiful yet but available </s>
<s> the brand that seems to pop up is that from hitachi and wd while others really offer dual 500gb setups in ready made ext </s>
<s> cases and or if you diy </s>
<s> it rally doesn t matter what hds are out there as all are prone to damage for whatever reason being 1tb isn t going to isolate it from similar damage </s>
<s> i tend to lean towards wd and seagate for typical installs seagate more as they have a better warranty period compared to anyone else </s>
<s> samsung is another to look for when 1tb is made by them </s>
<s> imho wait for seagate offerings if at all possible </s>
<s> so far i haven t heard any horror stories but i don t fix a zillion hd problems neither </s>
<s> adios willy </s>
<s> put it in an external usb 2 enclosure </s>
<s> bring money </s>
<s> google info on it and discover it sets up some roadblocks to file sharing for certain file types that might interfere with your intended use of the drive or not </s>
<s> supposedly if you don t load the mionet software you won t have the oppressive digital rights management policing the drive s usage </s>
<s> unfortunately most places selling the world book 1tb drives don t mention any of that in the sales pitch </s>
<s> here s the most popular article about it </s>
<s> for primary data storage </s>
<s> for backup of data stored on internal drives </s>
<s> really need portability </s>
<s> is there room for another internal drive </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> thank you all for your input and suggestions </s>
<s> i really very much appreciate it </s>
<s> to vapcmd thanks for pointing me to the storage forums </s>
<s> i didn t get too much information about 1 tb hard drives but a lot about external hard drives as well as good or bad brands </s>
<s> as per your other questions i would like to use this hard drive as an external hard drive for it s portability and not for primary storage or backup but just to use for my gigabytes worth of folders i transfer and download </s>
<s> after much research surrounding terabytes there are some things i ve learned </s>
<s> i don t know if it s good or bad but because there aren t much 1 tb hard drives it wasn t a vast amount of research that was required </s>
<s> although the wd world book is the most known and by far the cheapest there have also been a lot of complaints about it as well </s>
<s> also i have had negative experience with western digital hard drives as well to add unto it </s>
<s> what i have heard is that seagate is an execellent brand with much positive feedback about their hard drive </s>
<s> it s significantly more but it seems the most worth it because of it s extraordinary manufacturer s warranty </s>
<s> this works well because of all the research on how these hard drives fail as well </s>
<s> coincidentally enough i ended up going the route that coryphaeus suggested </s>
<s> thank you all again </s>
<s> it seems that all that i have researched is confirmed by all of you </s>
<s> if anything it puts my doubts at ease as i have already gone through with all the purchases and what not </s>
<s> thank you </s>
