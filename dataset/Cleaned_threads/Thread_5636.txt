<s> hi i bought a sony dvd burner drive and i hook up to my workstation </s>
<s> some times my xp pro recognizing the drive and most of the times it is not recognzing </s>
<s> i can t see the drive in file explorer </s>
<s> when i go to the safe mode i was able to see </s>
<s> right now it is not working and i was frustrated why it is not recognizing </s>
<s> pls help me out with this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> is it jumpered properly </s>
<s> when you saw it in safe mode was there also another entry </s>
<s> if so remove all of the entries and then reboot and let the system find it again </s>
<s> power and ribbon cables for likely damage and are securely plugged in </s>
<s> are you using clonecd or uninstalled it recently </s>
<s> i had this problem and it appeared to stem from that </s>
