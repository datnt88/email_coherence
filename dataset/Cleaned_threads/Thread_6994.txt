<s> i have a pc running xp that has a dual head s vga video card </s>
<s> it came with a cable which splits it to two vga outs </s>
<s> so i comfortably run two monitirs at a decent relolution </s>
<s> one goes to a projector the other to my monitor </s>
<s> cool beans </s>
<s> now i have a need for an additional s video out carrying the same signal as the projector which goes to a video switcher and ultimately to a dvd recorder </s>
<s> what is the simplest way to accomplish this </s>
<s> i have an older all in wonder card that could be installed at no cost but will xp allow that </s>
<s> svga is not the same as s video </s>
<s> are you looking for an adaptor that would convert svga to s video </s>
<s> so long as it has different interface agp pci pci express than your primary video card and you have a slot for it </s>
<s> but you re trying to clone a high res s vga image onto low res s video signal </s>
<s> that s going to be a problem unless a you re willing to drop the res of one of the s vga outputs or b you re prepared to manually switch your video playback between output devices s vga or s video </s>
<s> ati s video driver can automatically send video to a preferred monitor but i don t think it can send it to two seperate monitors of different resolutions </s>
<s> the video cable needs to be connected directly to the tv for windows to configure and use it properly </s>
<s> get a switcher for the tv not the dvd </s>
<s> if i have a pci dual head svga and one vga card all in wonder would they not process the signal separately </s>
