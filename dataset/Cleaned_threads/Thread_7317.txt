<s> recently i ve turned off my psu and unplugged my computer then replugged it from moving </s>
<s> but then from then on my computer would go straight into the bios setup seconds after i turned on my computer </s>
<s> so then i would save setting and exit my bios setup after checking all setting were correct </s>
<s> but after this my computer would just go to a blank black screen and freeze and wouldn t boot into windows </s>
<s> i would restart but it would do nothing forcing me to force shut down my computer </s>
<s> then i would turn it on again same thing happens </s>
<s> because it goes into the bios setup in seconds after turning it on i cannot prompt it to go to safe mode or anything </s>
<s> my computer has been like this for weeks </s>
<s> i ve also check my boot settings as it boots first from my hard drive and then my dvd rom </s>
<s> i ve also switched this around with no luck </s>
<s> i ve tried to have it boot from my dvd rom so i can try reformatting it </s>
<s> but still it jumps straight into the bios setup </s>
<s> any one got suggestions to fix this </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> computer boots to bios several options there it sounds like a hardware problem </s>
<s> what do you by chance mean </s>
<s> you shifted the computer to a new location </s>
<s> if so sounds like loose cable somewhere internally either on your harddisk side or motherboard size </s>
<s> check all cables internally are connected securely which could have came off while moving else it seems quite bad news to me regarding your harddisk </s>
<s> in your bios is your motherboard able to detect the harddisk </s>
<s> if no your harddisk may have it s cable loose or worst damaged </s>
<s> if yes your partition may have crashed big </s>
<s> if you can remove the harddisk test it on another system as an external or something to see you can save off important files before doing anything else </s>
<s> are you able to hear whether the harddisk is making some spinning noise </s>
<s> if it doesn t there s possibility the powerline supplyiing the harddisk has failed thus need to switch to another powerline </s>
