<s> i would like to build a dual processor computer but i don t know what motherboards can support this and what processors work best </s>
<s> i like to multi task and my computer now is just slow when i m doing anything that s processor intensive such as encoding a dvd </s>
<s> i read about multi core processors and if they work the same as dual processor then i suppose i could use that </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you are looking at opterons and xeons </s>
<s> the p4 is not a dual cpu design </s>
<s> however the ht version of the p4 does show dual cpus in windows nt 2000 xp and linux </s>
<s> and does pretty darn good in transcoding sessions at a good price compared to dual cpu opteron xeon based computers </s>
<s> today i d get a 3 ghz p4 with 800mhz fsb later this year a dual core athlon 64 bob </s>
<s> the opteron and xeon are pretty expensive </s>
<s> are there no cheaper processors that can be dual </s>
<s> for intel the i486dx most of the pentiums p2 p3 </s>
<s> the p4 is not a dual cpu design </s>
<s> then we have the xeon and itaniums </s>
<s> for sun then have some units from 1 to a few hundred sparc cpus </s>
<s> the old mips cpu was multiple cpu capable but stickly listed for mention then we have the alpha but not in wide distribution </s>
<s> in the apple camp they have some dual powerpc or powerspec or such </s>
<s> i hope this gives you the lay of the land today </s>
<s> the ht tends to be you lowest cost almost full dual core unit today </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what motherboards are good but cost effective </s>
<s> i would like to build a decent dual processor system below 1500 is at all possible </s>
<s> also i thought amd had some processors that could be used as dual processors if the motherboard supported it </s>
<s> will the multi core be faster than dual processor systems nowdays even though they sound the same </s>
<s> i m really not all that dumb when it comes to putting a computer together i just am not good at putting this processor with that motherboard </s>
<s> if i can just get those 2 picked out i think i can take it from there </s>
<s> i would have bought a system but i can t find many places online that sell dual processor desktops </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> those were not quot friendly quot to builders </s>
<s> most builders tried to shortchange the power supply or the case cooling </s>
<s> if this is your first pc build you will not be happy </s>
<s> not many places sell dual cpu boards </s>
<s> it s a premium product </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> how can i tell which motherboards are dual processor capable </s>
<s> for example at pricewatch com </s>
<s> it should be fairly obvious </s>
<s> it will be outrageously expensive and the dual processor sockets are pretty distinct </s>
<s> this board supports dual xeon processors up to 3 6ghz a peice </s>
<s> it has support for up to 16gb s of dual channel ddr2 ram it has pci express the works </s>
<s> but a board like this and the dual processors will most likely cost you 1500 by themselves </s>
<s> you never said what you are using now </s>
<s> anyway i built a dual processor piii tualitin 1 2ghz with 1gb ram 2 years ago very fast for the time </s>
<s> it would render a 20min vedio segment in about 12 14min </s>
<s> complete a seti unit in 5 6 hours </s>
<s> got everything off ebay ended up spending about 700 </s>
<s> an amd2700xp will outrun it an amd 64 3000 will eat it alvie do a seti unit in 2 7 hours </s>
<s> remember when your encoding a dvd or any video app </s>
<s> there is no multi tasking no matter how fast your processor is since those programs take all of the cpu s cycles they just getit done faster </s>
<s> add up the cost of one expensive but superfast pc or 2 fast pcs but reasonible cost </s>
<s> i have 4 pcs on a kvm switch and just switch to a different pc when one is rendering video </s>
<s> your choice john </s>
