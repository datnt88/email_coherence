<s> you may have a quot cooling problem quot be sure that the pc case is well taken care of </s>
<s> if needed that the video card has even more air flow or that immediate hot air pushed out besides what it already does </s>
<s> since you seem to be into gaming all too often cooling issues arise </s>
<s> prolonged play and or hi end usage tends to find the weakest link </s>
<s> thus cooling is very important not only to keep up and running but also to reduce any quot heat stress quot because once that takes hold again the weakest part will start to falter though it won t outright fail but produce symptoms such as yours </s>
<s> also if possible increase the wattage for your pc as well 580w maybe at the edge of good use but having more is a good thing </s>
<s> if this pc has running well for some time and now seems to be acting up this a result of heat stress imho </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> then you are stuck with issues that require you to figure which part is either getting too hot if there is a part that doesn t work well with the others and arcane things like matching the bios settings to your ram </s>
<s> today i m beginning to find that such is too much to ask and the sellers of this are not providing support even when you buy from them </s>

<s> computers sometimes freeze but if a computer freezes on startup regularly or if it freezes when multi tasking there s probably something wrong </s>
<s> a computer could suffer permanent damage when it stops running abruptly these illegal operations or freezes can many times be related to bad or intermittent hardware or simply mismatched hardware mismatched hardware is common even some of the large computer manufactures do insufficient analyses and testing when they select the components that make up their systems </s>
<s> many components that make up a computer just don t play well together </s>
