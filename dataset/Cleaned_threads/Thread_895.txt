<s> my epson stylus c 62 printer has recently started printing only part of a page even if i print a multiple page document i get only the top part of the pages sometimes just a few lines sometimes half the page sometimes two thirds of a page </s>
<s> this happens no matter what my source is word notepad internet it does not matter </s>
<s> it worked fine when i was using windows 98 i recently upgraded to windows xp </s>
<s> i can t remember if it started when i changed over or if it was awhile after </s>

<s> i have a few spare ink carts for the c62 bob </s>
<s> here is the website for the newer drivers etc for the c 62 it could also be that there has been a problem for the printer </s>
<s> if the new drivers do not solve the problem i would explore a different printer as the c 62 is getting old </s>
