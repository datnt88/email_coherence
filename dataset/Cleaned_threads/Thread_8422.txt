<s> do you think that the antek 1200 cpu case is the most suitaqble one for my msi eclpse motherboard loaded with 3 video card 5 hard disk 2 blu ray psu included </s>
<s> any good suggestion </s>
<s> or better cpu case much larger than antek 1200 is more likely appreciated </s>
<s> it should be big enough to hold everything </s>
<s> i think the only issue might be some longer cable may be need you will get that solution when you get to that point </s>
<s> i like antec stuffs good building </s>
<s> not a cpu case easier to assist if the terminology is correct </s>
<s> picking out a computer case for a new build or as an addition is strictly a personal choice however with new technology comes more problems in regards to heat management and making sure there is ample room for the newer video cards etc </s>
<s> the antec 1200 is a nice case 20 2 x 8 4 x 22 9 inches the corsair obsidian 800d is only 40 more than the 1200 24 0 x 9 0 x 24 0 inches offering more room better airflow better cable management </s>
