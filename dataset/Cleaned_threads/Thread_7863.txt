<s> i have this samsung 400gb pata drive that spins ok but windows wants to initialise all the time </s>
<s> i have tried easyrecovery professional and it says there s no file system on it the rapid smart test shows the drive passes the test so i tried the raw data recovery option but after 5 minutes i get an error message and the drive starts clicking so i stopped it immediately </s>
<s> i tried r studio and it too sees the drive with no file system attempts a raw recovery but there again after 5 minutes the drive starts to click and i stop it </s>
<s> now i boot from ubuntu cd ubuntu rescue remix or even knoppix and none of them sees the drive </s>
<s> any idea how to get my data back </s>
<s> it might be interesting if you told what that error message is </s>
<s> the best way to get your data back is from your backup </s>
<s> the second best way is by paying a data recovery company </s>
<s> with disks that fail mechanically as appears to be the case with this one that s quite expensive </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i ve just downloaded the samsung utility test and it passed with flying colors all the tests read dma spin down up check smart simple surface scan write verify random surface scan ram verify test multiple read test quot your dd has no error quot it says lt div gt lt div gt </s>
<s> so it s a perfect drive </s>
<s> but it s unpartitioned raw recovery stops after 5 minutes if you trust that diagnostic you simply repartition it loose all your data and hope for the best </s>
<s> but you said you want to recover your data so maybe that wouldn t be your preferred idea </s>
<s> all i can offer try the other recovery programs from maybe one works </s>
<s> maybe none work </s>
<s> you ll only know when you try </s>
<s> kees </s>
