<s> would love to find a laser printer that works with refilled cartridges trying to be green or at least has cartridges with such high yield that you don t mind paying for them every once in a while </s>
<s> it s a small office we probably print less than 50 sheets a day and do not require color printing </s>
<s> we are switching to laser due to running through our print cartridges so quickly with the inkjet and being fed up with printers not working with refilled or refurbished cartridges </s>
<s> if you have a suggestion for or against any laser we would appreciate it </s>
<s> there are a lot of laser printers out there for a basic reasonably inexpensive one look at brother i saw one on sale i believe at office depot for around 70 00 a couple of weeks ago </s>
<s> as i said there are many manufacturers out there it depends on what you are doing from a quantitative standpoint </s>
<s> the best thing to do would be to go and look at a few and compare specifications cost per page etc </s>
<s> best of luck </s>
<s> lt a href quot gt lt a gt lt span gt ive had an hp laserjet 1018 for 4 5 years now not wireless and it has run very very well </s>
<s> having wireless technology will work very well in an office setting </s>
<s> i have never used a stock hp cartridge with this one except the very first one that came with the printer </s>
<s> hp wants 70 bucks for them and i m getting them on amazon now for 11 bucks including shipping </s>
<s> our family has always had good luck with hps </s>
<s> another thing to keep in mind is that at least when i was shopping for a laser you might want to see if the drum is a separate accessory and if so how many pages you can expect to print off of one before replacing it </s>
<s> when i was shopping hp said that the drums are built into each cartridge so you don t have to worry about this but they can be quite expensive for other printers </s>
<s> maybe they are all like this now built into the toner cartridge but when i was buying this a brother that i was thinking of had it as an extra part that would need to be replaced </s>
<s> practically all laser ptrs </s>
<s> out there have refillable toner carts available </s>
<s> the more popular the more likely easily available </s>
<s> there are also services that maybe local to you that provide the actual refill service or carts when needed </s>
<s> from what i ve seen brother and samsung have the bottom end of mono lasers out there </s>
<s> they re good and you need to review the specs </s>
<s> many are under 100 and deals can be had </s>
<s> at those prices you can buy another printer and leave it on the shelf until dire need </s>
<s> replacement toner carts while new from oem are cheaper now refills still are cheaper but as always cheap is cheap </s>
<s> buy from a source you deem worthy </s>
<s> also hp has low cost mono laser but here you need to review what options start to fall into place like wifi memory paper handling duplex etc to include other brands as well </s>
<s> a low end printer should last at least 2yrs </s>
<s> before some issue crops up and that also depends on usage </s>
<s> as a small soho don t settle for price alone </s>
<s> i have recommended konica hp and canon while more expensive tend to simply last under normal use </s>
<s> taeda willy </s>
<s> be careful with refilled toner cartridges </s>
<s> i used to spend my days charging a lot more than a cartridge costs to tell people quot the problem is the toner cartridge quot or worse yet cleaning up the mess when a quot rebuilt quot cartridge dumped its toner in the machine </s>
<s> canon basic smallest model appears to be the best for home use </s>
<s> it has many features not found in others </s>
<s> i am using it for about 2 years now without any trouble </s>
<s> i am delighted to use it </s>
<s> lt div gt lt div gt </s>
<s> hi when you are checking out the specs as others have suggested be sure to check the duty cycle usually expressed in pages per month it s a pretty good indication of the workload a printer can handle </s>
<s> that said most lasers will have no problem with your 1000 pages per month 50x20 </s>
<s> i ve had a samsung ml 1750 for about six years now and the quality of the print is still as good as the day i bought it </s>
<s> it happily runs on cartridge world refilled toner cartridges ut then they do refill genuine samsung cartridges not compatibles </s>
<s> the only niggle with samsung is that the initial cartridge supplied with the printer is half load a tad mean </s>
<s> hp laserjet 10xx models have a pretty good reputation too and should be fine for the print capacity you need </s>
<s> i ve no experience with brother but their price is very attractive </s>
<s> depending on your needs you might want to take a look at some of the laser all in ones that have now reached the quot affordable quot level </s>
<s> can also result in a blue face if the refill invalidates the warranty </s>
<s> i have a brother 5370dw its a work horse fast printing print on both sides of the paper wifi </s>
<s> they sell around 170 to 200 </s>
