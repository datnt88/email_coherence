<s> i moved to linksys after my 2nd netgear wireless increasing lost range my first one died outright </s>
<s> but as it still has a little life in it anyone know if it s possible to bride the netgear to linksys so extend wireless range </s>
<s> i ve also wondered if a macairport could be used for the same purpose </s>
<s> or do i have to stick with netgear </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any ideas </s>
<s> i read your post twice and it appears you don t want what a bridge does </s>
<s> so i ll write quot no quot bob </s>
<s> i have done this with two linksys wireless g routers as described here connecting two wrt54g routers together </s>
<s> the same networking principles should apply to connecting two different routers but there is no guarantee of success </s>
<s> post the particular router models that you are using </s>
<s> maybe someone has done this </s>
<s> it doesn t fit your situation and is more complicated but it is possible to wirelessly connect two linksys routers with the same 3rd party firmware that is capable of implementing wds </s>
