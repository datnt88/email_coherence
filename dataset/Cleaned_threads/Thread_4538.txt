<s> i recently purchased a tv that didnt specify that only pc input was 1024x768 resolution </s>
<s> the component cable connecters on back are 1080p and i want to connect to that port so my pc can display 1080p </s>
<s> so i was wondering what do i have to get to make that possible </s>
<s> specs evga 7900 gt ko video card akai lct37z6ta telivison </s>
<s> you need a pc video card with that resolution and connector output </s>
<s> i didn t research your video card </s>
<s> if it doesn t have the proper output you ll need to get one that does </s>
<s> there s no way to change the tvs pc input </s>
<s> i am guessing you don t have 1080p on that tv </s>
<s> if it has 1080p i am pretty sure there would also be hdmi connection </s>
<s> what kind of contents are you trying to view at 1080p </s>
<s> you have a ps3 or blu ray player on that pc </s>
<s> i will also venture to say if you don t have a hd video card you might not have much fun trying to output 1080p contents </s>
<s> just my thoughts </s>
