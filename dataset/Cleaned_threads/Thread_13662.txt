<s> hi i have a toshiba tablet laptop and lost my software modem agere </s>
<s> it intially had com3 but wasn t working working after loading i think bluetooth stacking software so i thought i would just uninstall and delete the modem for it to auto find itself again </s>
<s> no such luck </s>
<s> i downloaded the modem software with drivers from toshiba used their delete program and reinstalled </s>
<s> still no modem </s>
<s> i tried to add 56k standard modem but there were no com ports in the dialog box </s>
<s> i have a usb printer on com4 that works fine </s>
<s> any help is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> alan </s>
<s> i am using xp </s>
<s> alan </s>
<s> what shows on com 3 now </s>
<s> another option if windows won t auto detect and you have the correct driver is to use the quot have disk quot option to add new hardware </s>
<s> thanks for responding </s>
<s> this is a laptop and i believe the modem is a software modem agere and is part of the motherboard </s>
<s> i would say it is a hardware problems except it was there saying it wasn t attached to a com port </s>
<s> i deleted it thinking it would refind itself but it didn t </s>
<s> now it doesn t show anything when i look in the control panel phone and modems </s>
<s> i reloaded the driver for the modem </s>
<s> i tried to add a com port and it picked com3 which leads me to think it was also removed </s>
<s> i got a yellow exclamation even though i changed the resources to reflect no conflicts </s>
<s> any help is appreciated </s>
<s> alan </s>
<s> put the driver files in a folder of your choice </s>
<s> call it quot modem quot if you wish </s>
<s> go to add remove hardware but don t let windows search for new devices but use the quot have disk quot option </s>
<s> point to the driver in the folder you used </s>
<s> it should display the modem </s>
<s> sometimes driver utils cover several models so you need to have an idea of what it is </s>
<s> select the right model </s>
<s> windows will alert you if it doesn t match any of your hardware </s>
<s> if it s a match install it and see what happens </s>
<s> i have the driver in a folder </s>
<s> wen i use have disk it shows an inf file but doesn t show any modems </s>
<s> i think the problem may lay with having no com port </s>
<s> when i add a port com3 comes up which means maybe it wasn t there </s>
<s> unfortunately i get a yellow exclamation even after i remove all conflicts </s>
<s> any help is appreciated </s>
<s> disable an unused com port in the bios if possible </s>
<s> if your modem is actually still there and functional you might be able to put it on that port </s>
<s> you did mention something in your first post about a bluetooth device installation </s>
<s> did that coincide with this problem </s>
<s> if so backtracking to a point before that might offer clues </s>
<s> i deleted the driver in the system32 driver and it reloaded on com11 </s>
<s> however i now get a message saying the port modem attached to couldn t be opened </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> alan </s>
<s> sounds like a virtual port </s>
<s> in my other post i suggested you try backing out of the bluetooth software you seemed to suggest was related to the modem going missing </s>
<s> if it worked before the new software but not afterwards it would make sense to verify the suspicion by removing that software and seeing what would happen </s>
<s> in fact remove it and see if you don t have a restore point available that s prior to that time </s>
