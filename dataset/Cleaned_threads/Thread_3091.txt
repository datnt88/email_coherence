<s> i m not in the repair or resale business rather the school of why </s>
<s> this was part of the compaq presario 4550 given to me last year </s>
<s> it also contained cd rom floppy and zip drives </s>
<s> i only used the ethernet nic to backup data from my xp and then disconnected the power connection </s>
<s> syncback 5 stars </s>
<s> i have a guess why the 4550 was changed this way but not sure </s>
<s> anyhow this year i was given an hp pavilion 6746c </s>
<s> i had to replace the psu floppy and hdd </s>
<s> so i traded the at psu 4550 for an atx and the old floppy 4550 for another at my computer club </s>
<s> then i put the above hardware into the 6746c </s>
<s> celeron 733mhz the more i read about ata the confusier i get </s>
<s> i m guessing this setup in the 6746c maybe should just be connected to the motherboard and remove the promise ide controller </s>
<s> i still use the 6746c for backup to the xp system with an ethernet connection and syncback </s>
<s> the promise add in cards had several possible uses </s>
<s> they could increase the number of ide devices one could put in older pcs whose motherboards only allowed for 4 as well some older motherboards couldn t take advantage of the size or speed of newer drives </s>
<s> by now this is all past </s>
<s> if your motherboard specs say they support ata 133 which your drive can handle you can yank the promise card </s>
<s> there isn t much use for these anymore </s>
<s> drives larger than 137gbs even if the mb bios won t </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> i now understand how to ask a better question </s>
<s> the pavilion 6746c trigem cognac board supports pio mode 3 and 4 so does the 40gb hdd run at the 133 speed or revert to the lower speed of the mother board </s>
<s> the history is interesting to me since i started clicking in the pc world in 2004 with a dell 2400 promise no longer sells the 133tx2 </s>
<s> the 6746c sold for 800 real money in y2k </s>
