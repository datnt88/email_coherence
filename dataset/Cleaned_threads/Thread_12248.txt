<s> what one </s>
<s> amd athlon 64 3000 venice 90nm socket 939 or amd athlon 64 3200 venice 90nm socket 939 there is a 20 step in price that s like 39 would be be worth getting the more expensive one </s>
<s> would i notice a difference in gaming </s>
<s> but my understanding is that the video card has more impact on gaming and then the amount of memory </s>
<s> that slight difference in cpu speeds should be third </s>
<s> so put the money in the video card if you have it </s>
<s> check with ozos on which card </s>
<s> i know almost nothing about overclocking but i have heard it is quite easy to overclock a 3000 to a 3200 and a 3200 to a 3400 </s>
<s> if 3000 gt 3200 3200 gt 3400 i might go with he 3200 not sure though i am planing on another pc build so if i did get a 3000 i could later get a 3200 and pop the 3000 in me older one </s>
<s> it depends on you mb </s>
<s> i have a msi neo with a amd64 3000 running the fsb at 210mz </s>
<s> this takes the cpu up to the 3200 range </s>
<s> msi has an program app that does this in xp </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> a motherboard supporting pcexpress with a video card that pushed your finances in combination with dual channel ram would hedge you for the future as well as a performance demon take a look at amd systems at www gogocomputers com in the 899 </s>
<s> range to give you an idea the video card could be improved to the nvidia 6800 series and the hard drive could be changed to a hitachi for improve hard drive response thats what i would do hands down i was skeptical of hitachi harddrives until i bought a 160 gig unit 7k250 deskstar not expensive but performance dripping maybe investigate further system startups and file transfers were reduced in regards to time you may ask what do i reference this to </s>
<s> maxtor western digital quantum fugitsu and seagate used on my family system building do the research with the net google it use tomshardwarecorner etc </s>
<s> hope this is of help </s>
<s> you may want to overclock gpu </s>
<s> they re much easier to overclock and more heat resistant so it s safer too </s>
<s> it can be done just by using a user friendly software utility like this one cpu ocing is tricky and you really shouldn t do it espeically for amd processors </s>
<s> sometimes it can end up with higher clock rate but lower performance </s>
<s> listen what you want to do is you want to buy the amd athlon 64 3200 venice integrated into chip fsb 512kb l2 cache socket 939 processor oem </s>
<s> this comes without a fan so you ll have to supply your own </s>
<s> tigerdirect com is the best place to buy anything so buy it from there </s>
<s> but the reason you want to buy the 3200 over the 3000 is because the 3200 is the most easily overclocked chipset in the world </s>
<s> you can take this in exspensive 190 procesor and overclock it to 2 6 ghz </s>
<s> yes thats right the 3200 can be as powerful as the 900 clawhammer fx55 chipset </s>
<s> so the answer is buy the venice 3200 939 socket with the asus delux sli motherboard future profing and and nvidia 6800 gt </s>
<s> or go with a nice dfy motherboard </s>
<s> hope it was helpful </s>
<s> to hva a higher clock speed but slower performance </s>
<s> i ve heard that amd s were the better cpu s to oc cause they were designed to take up to a 33 oc as is </s>
