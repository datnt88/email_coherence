<s> do netbooks run the regular full function version of windows xp or is it a special netbook version with fewer features </s>
<s> if so what features are no longer available </s>
<s> also does not having an optical drive make it a pain to install new software </s>
<s> can you install virtual drives like daemon tools </s>
<s> with xp home </s>
<s> i can t see where anything less was installed </s>
<s> as to the no optical drive i spent 25 bucks for an external dvdrw for that unit at geeks com </s>
<s> why would this be an issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i barely use discs anymore anyway get most of the software online only needed a drive once to install a game but again daemon tools worked </s>
<s> run windows 7 on netbooks </s>
<s> here s a link to some info </s>
<s> the netbook i have came with xp but i ve got windows 7 running on it right now </s>
<s> not saying it s going to work in every instance but for me it s working well </s>
<s> cheers ron windows outreach team </s>
<s> i have a thinkpad x40 </s>
<s> no cd drive </s>
<s> however it came with a docking station that had a drive </s>
<s> most software i use is available over the net </s>
<s> thus you download and install </s>
<s> some software i ve purchased and requires a cd dvd drive </s>
<s> i had to hack some of it to make it run without the cd dvd check since i normally don t have the drive </s>
<s> short answer </s>
<s> quot yes no cd dvd drive is a pita quot if you need to intall some software </s>
<s> if you can get all that software over the net or alreayd do then it won t be a problem </s>
<s> re formating the computer without a os disk should be interesting </s>
<s> netbooks are intended to be portable companions to desktops and or full sized laptops not as a primary only computer </s>
<s> that s part of the reason they lack the optical drive it s assumed that the owner of the netbook has another machine with an optical drive </s>
<s> all you have to do is copy anything from a disc on your regular machine then transfer it to a flash drive or external hard drive </s>
<s> plug the drive into the usb port on the netbook and install from there </s>
<s> or you can share the optical drive with your home network and use your netbook to connect to the network then you will effectively have an optical drive even though it s not physically attached to your netbook </s>
<s> else you can get an external drive which can be cheap depending on where you get </s>
<s> to me netbooks are kind of a hassle </s>
<s> i mean i see the point in them </s>
<s> but notebook computers are so cheap nowadays </s>
<s> i mean you can get a decent full running pc notebook pretty cheap </s>
<s> for just a little bit more or even the same price as these netbooks you can get a budget notebook that will actually be faster and have a lot more hard drive space with cd drive </s>
<s> theres also a lot of 14 1 inch screens out now that have really powerful processors and lots of ram </s>
<s> so if you wanted small that would work also </s>
<s> but i still do see the need in a netbook for some people </s>
<s> although i d much rather have my standard 15 inch screen notebook </s>
<s> i have 4 gigs of ram 320 gig hard drive core 2 duo processor hdmi port dvd rw and it definitely feels portable enough for me </s>
<s> stick it in a back pack and go </s>
