<s> hey all i m in the process of upgrading my dell pc and i have a couple questions about compatability </s>
<s> i had hoped to buy asus s new sli capable motherboard to run two nvidia 6800 oc pci express cards </s>
<s> i also have an upgraded power supply </s>
<s> what else to i need to purchase in order to get my system up and running </s>
<s> thanks m walsh </s>
<s> one major problem with oem systems like dell gateway etc is when you decide to replace the mtrbd </s>
<s> the physical size and location of mountings may not be proper or outright not compatible as a direct replacement </s>
<s> what this means is you have to verify any replacement mtrbd </s>
<s> is rated or designed to be one for your dell system otherwise don t expect an easy drop in and proceed forward w o extra effort </s>
<s> i suppose you were trying to re use the dell case </s>
<s> if not and plan to buy or have access to a generic of dyi case source then you re ok last don t expect the os to be transferable it may but it may not </s>
<s> the oem supplied os is prone to work only what it was sold with however dell is more flexible than others but again i can t say for your model 100 sure </s>
<s> enjoy willy </s>
<s> i actually have an extra case that i can use to transfer my system to so that wouldnt be a problem </s>
<s> my main concern is the processors compatability with a new motherboard </s>
<s> it would be nice to be able to pick up a new pci express motherboard and grapics card and not have to drop 1000 on a new amd processor </s>
<s> cpus can be swapped amongest other mtrbds </s>
<s> provided they re supported </s>
<s> the cpu type model and or class is best described by the mtrbd </s>
<s> specs and what it entails </s>
<s> you should have available new heatsink compound to use as the old may not work well once the seal is broken from removing the hsf and then cpu </s>
<s> i ve done this mucho times and rarely have a problem </s>
<s> beware though proper handling procedures from esd static should be followed plus proper ordination into cpu socket </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> the asus is only for amd64 939 pin </s>
<s> when all you keep from your old machine is the power supply and drives that s not an upgrade it s a whole new machine </s>
<s> and sli is just for bragging anyway </s>
<s> why spend an extra 500 for a 8 bump in framerates </s>
<s> you wont even be able to tell it s working cuz a single 6800 oc is enough to turn all eyecandy to full anyway </s>
<s> there is no sli for p4 so you have to 1 buy amd proc or 2 rethink sli i don t know if your 8250 had ddr or ddr2 ram </s>
<s> hopefully not ddr2 cuz thats only for p4 </s>
<s> maybe if you gave your proc speed ram size and number of dimms we could find a path for you </s>
