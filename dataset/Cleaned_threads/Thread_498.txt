<s> i have an hp deskjet 5550 that prints acceptable photos with its regular color bw ink </s>
<s> when i put in the special photo ink cartidges the print quality takes a nosedive </s>
<s> suggestions </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> use the photo paper plus tell the printer driver about the change to cartidge and paper </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this all along and it has made no difference </s>
<s> is this something i should ask hp about since the printer and scanner are theirs </s>
<s> sorry but the printers here seem just fine </s>
<s> but then again i m pretty stock latest drivers for printer video etc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> went to their online chat and found what the problem was </s>
<s> what solved the problem </s>
<s> standeb </s>
<s> the technician and i finally figured it out </s>
<s> since i hadn t been getting good printing copies using the photo ink i thought the cradle that came in the box might be something i was supposed to be using </s>
<s> that turned out to be a quot holder quot for the cartridge when it is not being used </s>
<s> eventually i was steered to a page which explained the correct combination of cartridges to use </s>
<s> 57 is the color cartridge whether it be regular or photo </s>
<s> the other cartridge uses a 56 or 58 i had to make sure that i was using the 57 photo and the 58 photo grey rather than just the black and white cartridge or the photo grey with just the color cartridge </s>
<s> still i don t see that using the photo ink makes a much better photo print than using regular ink </s>
<s> still perhaps the photo inks last longer </s>
<s> earmonivergh hi thank you for the reply </s>
<s> i think that you may at some point in time want to try a better printer </s>
<s> i have had two epson printers epson stylus c42 and now epson stylus c65 </s>
<s> the life of the c42 expired and the c65 although i got some problems installing the same it works really good </s>
<s> the reproduction is fantastic </s>
<s> i am happy with it although i need to have a printer that would give me 18 b w s per minute and 15 colour per minute </s>
<s> having said this you will not doubt understand that i will be going for an epson </s>
<s> you will get quality for your money </s>
<s> i have tried hp and canon </s>
<s> none compares </s>
<s> visit epson website </s>
