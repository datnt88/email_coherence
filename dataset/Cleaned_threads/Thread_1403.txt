<s> i m not sure what you are trying to do </s>
<s> do you want msconfig in win2k </s>
<s> the dirty secret is that xp s msconfig does work in win2k but do so at your own risk </s>
<s> you can copy the executable from xp and drop it in the appropriate win2k folder and make your own shortcut </s>
<s> i m not certain however that win2k s quot expand quot can extract the file from an xp installation cd </s>
<s> where can i find the article online in full of fast fixes may 2005 issue rick broida that was in computer shopper mag </s>
<s> thanks </s>
