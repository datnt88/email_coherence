<s> when using my laptops in the other end of the building from the present router the wireless is disconnected and signal is zero because of many walls in between </s>
<s> rather than spending on wireless extenders or repeaters or antennas i thought of plugging in a second dsl modem into the phone outlet in that other end of the building </s>
<s> this means i would need to buy a second router for that second setup </s>
<s> so is there such a thing as a combo modem wireless router available that i can just plug a cable into the phone outlet like a conventional dsl modem and then 4 wired connections to computers from the same combo unit plus getting the wireless capability </s>
<s> sorry for this wordy description </s>
<s> if any info would appreciate links to some vendors or models </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> my home can accomodate 2 dsl modems and my dsl supplier has that device you ask for </s>
<s> but the charge would be another 39 bucks a month to turn on the second dsl line </s>
<s> seems rather steep but it can be an option for those willing to pay </s>

<s> thanks for your prompt reply bob </s>
<s> expensive i ll find an alternative </s>
<s> i thought it s like plugging in a second phone into another phone outlet </s>
<s> you can find a multitude of adsl2 modem wireless router combos everywhere at very reasonable pricing or even used good working condition on ebay for less than 20 </s>
<s> you are correct in that they can plug directly into your phone jack dsl filters are only for phones faxes where you do not want a dsl on the line otherwise as stated no filter in the jack you have a instant access to dsl which the modem is plugged into </s>
<s> word of advice stay away from 2wire modems if you can especially if you re looking to get some range out of the device </s>
<s> they are horrible setting up or using wpa is a complete nightmare </s>
<s> i have heard that linksys cause some a bit of a headache also when initially setting them up but there are very good reasonably priced modem router combos by d link my favorite mainly b c i m used to the interface belkin am currently looking into a few new ones myself by zoom x6 model for example etc </s>
<s> one other thing to make sure of is the compatibility 802 11b g should be fine for all computers laptops netbooks these days 802 11n has even faster speeds range without much interference i e </s>
<s> portable phones etc </s>
<s> but make sure you re compatible or at least that they are backward compatible w 802 11b g you re off to the races </s>
