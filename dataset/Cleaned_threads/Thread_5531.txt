<s> the problem is the software is kind of screw up as well i look at the instructions and it tells me to go a particular place which is imposible to get there becoz 3 4 tabs is missing </s>
<s> anyway i have the exact problem and the same key changes as this guy after playing cs </s>
<s> if logitech can t make it work all i can share is that i also don t have a ready fix </s>
<s> but i will share that my lessons over the years taught me to never install logitech mouse or keyboard drivers </s>
