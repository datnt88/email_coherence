<s> hey is there anyone who can help me </s>
<s> i have an dell dimesion 4400 very old it has a dpt478 motherboard </s>
<s> i have a 1 6 pentium in it and have just scored a celeron d335 processor </s>
<s> i see the cooling fan and heat sinks dont fit but can i still use the processor with my old coolling system </s>
<s> do i have to edit and bios </s>
<s> any help would be much apreciated </s>
<s> you might be able to </s>
<s> go into your bios and see if there is a cpu temperature reading if you want to use the old heatsink and fan </s>
<s> remember you need to grease the heatsink with the cpu </s>
<s> besides don t the cpu you have came with a heatsink and fan combo mine did but it was a pentinum d if not look up a heatsink with the correct socket for the motherboard </s>
<s> you can look it up on yahoo or google and find the motherboard and its socket type </s>
<s> hope that helps </s>
<s> heatsink fan mounting is standardized for socket 478 and that s a mid tower case so height shouldn t be an issue </s>
<s> i wouldn t recommend using the original cooler since this cpu runs more than 1ghz higher and hotter than your original cpu </s>
<s> the latest bios for that system is from june 2002 2 full years prior to the release of the celeron 335 the dimension s bios may not know how to deal with that cpu </s>
<s> hey thanks for replying o k well i ve tryed the new processor celeron d 335 and no go my computer or motherboard or whatever wont reconize it </s>
<s> so i ve looked all over the net and have found out that intel no longer supports my motherboard but the last info on it that they posted was it supported a celeron 1 8 i think it was so i m thinking that if i change my bios to read the new processor it will work i m new to this stuff so if i m totally wrong dont hold it against me </s>
<s> exactly what i was thinking </s>
<s> can i change the bios to read the new cpu </s>
<s> if so can you tell me how </s>
<s> and as to the fan thing i dont have a clue why it doesnt fit the old system was a alu block mounted to the cpu with the fan mounted to the casing </s>
<s> the new systems clamps are completly different to the old </s>
<s> you may be able to get an updated bios from here but i think you re beating a dead horse </s>
<s> after the bios update and cpu change windows may need to be reinstalled or reactivated </s>
<s> you may just have problem after problem to deal with </s>
<s> if you are sure and double check what the bios update will support then it should recognize the celeron d 1 8 you are referring to </s>
<s> it should work because i just changed from celeron d to pentinum d on my intel motherboard but luckily i did not need to update my bios </s>
