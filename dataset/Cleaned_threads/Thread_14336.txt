<s> hi i recently bought an acer aspire notebook </s>
<s> when i plugged a gadget in the usb drive tried all 3 drives it says that the usb drive is low powered </s>
<s> i have tried a usb hub with a y cable a usb hub with external power and a usb 2 0 pcmcia card and it doesn t work </s>
<s> i checked and the usb port is 2 0 is there anything i can do to make it high powered </s>
<s> can i change the usb controller </s>
<s> any advice greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> question and make a suggestion 1 what does acer have to say about this </s>
<s> 2 if it s not fixed then use the warranty and exchange it </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
<s> duh </s>
<s> acer support were the first people i turned to for help </s>
<s> they said there was nothing wrong with the machine and therefore no exchange allowed </s>
<s> other techies i spoke to lectured me at length for wasting money on an acer </s>
<s> finds that along with others i ve never seen that message </s>
<s> there are low speed messages and a power message but not a message as presented </s>
<s> sorry but something is a little off here and it helps to use the same words as the message </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> already contacted acer in your first post </s>
<s> you d be surprised how many users haven t done that yet </s>
<s> bob s suggestion is a good one </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
<s> hi i posted a reply yesterday but it appears to be lost in cyber space </s>
<s> the message when i plugged in the gadget was quot you have a low powered usb machine </s>
<s> please contact your technician for assistance quot </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any assistance you can give </s>
<s> frankly i can only guess that some new programmer stuck it into a driver </s>
<s> may want to hear about this since it s a new message </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> i think i ll just sell the darn machine esp </s>
<s> since i have a buyer who is aware of the problem and for some strange reason is still eager to buy the acer </s>
<s> my next machine will definitely not be an acer </s>
