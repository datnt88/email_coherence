<s> hi i m running vista on my new laptop and trying to connect to my family s secured wireless network </s>
<s> it won t connect unless i reboot the router while my laptop is up and running </s>
<s> if the connection is interrupted for any reason including turning off or hibernating the laptop i can t get back on unless i unplug the router and plug it back in again </s>
<s> two other computers on the network 1 xp and 1 vista have no trouble establishing connection at all </s>
<s> has anyone heard of this problem before and if so how do i fix it </s>
<s> i note one reason in our forum sticky </s>
<s> but first tell us if you set it up as noted in our forum sticky </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but there are a bunch of stickies </s>
<s> for future reference how about linking hopefully you know how to the one you re specifically referring to </s>
<s> and this discussion has so little detail about the setup that i can t offer much more </s>
<s> that is do you feel that a member should post no details get asked then begin or should the member go ahead and share the details and skip the first round </s>
<s> in closing did you try turning off vista s broadcast flag </s>
<s> and if you want a direct link i m going to bow out </s>
<s> that flag on vista is widely discussed and quite a pain </s>
<s> in closing why dig up an old thread when you have a new issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> geez just admit you don t know how to hyperlink and let it go </s>
<s> you dug up an old post and don t have any network issue to discuss </s>
<s> if so please tell the forum that so folk know what your discussion is about </s>
<s> about me hyperlinking </s>
<s> unlike some forums some moderators tend to teach how to find things </s>
<s> that can upset those that want tech support </s>
<s> this is all volunteer so the sooner you learn to use the forum and do the basic searches the less you need support </s>
<s> bob </s>
