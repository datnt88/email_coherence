<s> maybe i m a little to novice to ask this question but i m curios and would like to learn </s>
<s> in my opinion am fm shortwave and ham radio waves would have more coverage or a beter signal in case some trees or other obstacles are in the way than wifi </s>
<s> wouldn t it be possible to modulate and demodulate wireless network into an other radio wave </s>
<s> in other words have a wireless network that transmits in am fm short wave or ham waves </s>
<s> another thought </s>
<s> what would the results be or is it possible to connect a gsm or gprs access point to a network then catch it with gprs card on the computer </s>
<s> wouldn t that give more coverage </s>
<s> more distance wouldn t that be a way also to connect with a cell phone and avoid the cell phone service providers high per bit transfer rate </s>
<s> what would be legal </s>
<s> would anyone be dangerous </s>
<s> etc </s>
<s> i will not research what the fcc regs are but you can </s>
<s> can you share why you need more than what 802 11a b g n wifi gives you today </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m searching for a way to get wifi or in other words any wireless network to my parents house located 2 kilometers form my house </s>
<s> see pictures and stories </s>
<s> notes 3 to 5 km so your s is less than that </s>
<s> the only requirement is los </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> those frequencies you mention are relatively low </s>
<s> because of this the data transmission will be low </s>
<s> higher frequency means higher data speed </s>
<s> data can be and is sent within those lower frequencies </s>
<s> but it s usually slower than dialup </s>
<s> if you ll dig a little notice the specific frequencies involved with the b g and n ranges and notice the associated data rates </s>
<s> is it possable to set up a gsm or gprs access point from ones own network </s>
<s> wouldn t that have a high range </s>
<s> i was under an impression you wanted a 2km link from your house to theirs </s>
<s> but that s not it </s>
<s> there are evdo routers that take the usual data card from your telco cellco and work great for remote locations </s>
