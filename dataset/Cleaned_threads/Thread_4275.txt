<s> i have winxp pro with a 2 4g p4 512 ram and trying the following on the nec dvd rw 1100 i m trying to get the drive to play a music cd so i can plug my headphones into the jack on the front panel of the drive </s>
<s> is there a utility that will cause this to work </s>
<s> i ve tried letting windows media player run the cd and can hear through speakers etc </s>
<s> but if i plug headphones into the front jack i hear nothing through the headphones </s>
<s> i can unplug the speakers and plug the headphones into the sound card and hear fine </s>
<s> i m trying to troubleshoot a quot static like quot pop or click that occurs only when a wav sound file streaming media mp3 or a cd is played through the system sound card </s>
<s> there is only the insert eject button the volume control and the headphone jack on the drive itself </s>
<s> perhaps i should be using a particular type of headphones </s>
<s> i m using my koss pro 4x stereo headphones </s>
<s> thanks ron </s>
<s> read and set wmp to play back in analog mode </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi robert and happy new year </s>
<s> that s quite a site </s>
<s> fortunately i can t find anything that applies this is a good thing my interpretation </s>
<s> wmp is up to 9 00 00 2980 directx was updated in the past two weeks </s>
<s> i only have one mp3 it was from clint black s site and offered free </s>
<s> other than that i don t download music files </s>
<s> no worries about pirated software just not worth it </s>
<s> xp pro is patched and drivers are updated as far as i m aware of </s>
<s> virus mal spyware regularly scanned for </s>
<s> i switched from digital to analog but still no joy on the headphones playback from the front jack </s>
<s> this audio anomaly is mostly heard during system wav files windows start etc </s>
<s> or feed from internet stream or web sites playing midi or wav files </s>
<s> i very seldom play audio cd s or video dvd s so i m only trying to use the drive to exclude the sound card source </s>
<s> i started with dell a couple days ago and they ve had me disconnecting this and that and everything in between </s>
<s> they seem to be looking for some sound issuing from a device but i can t seem to get them to understand that it is only heard through the speakers when played through the sound card </s>
<s> i ve moved the system isolated the sub woofer on a separate electric outlet tested with two other speaker systems and as i mentioned plugged my headphones into the speaker output from the sound card and get the same results every time </s>
<s> not sure where to turn at this point </s>
<s> it s not keeping me from using the computer and isn t causing any problems elsewhere </s>
<s> just something annoying </s>
<s> i would like to simply un install the sound card totally and replace it with a new one but right now i think this is dell s call </s>
<s> i m patient </s>
<s> thanks bob ron </s>
<s> if i re read both your posts then i realise that you may be expecting the cd audio output jack on a cdrom drive to output sound from the computer s sound card </s>
<s> quot ain t gonna happen quot bob </s>
<s> you do have the audio control turned up on the drive </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> no that s exactly what i want to bypass bob </s>
<s> i m trying to hear what s being played by using just the headphone jack on the drive independent of the sound card </s>
<s> i figured that was the only point of audio output i could use to isolate the play back from the sound card </s>
<s> ron </s>
<s> yup i can rotate it back and forth but still no sound through the headphones </s>
<s> ron </s>
<s> 1 what cd is this </s>
<s> while i did write quot audio cd quot and to make sure the settings are all set to analog playback another person had made a cd with mp3 files on it and was unaware it was not quot cd audio quot or quot audio cd quot just want to be crystal clear on this </s>
<s> use some store bought cd to clear up 1 2 of this question </s>
<s> 2 is it in analog playback </s>
<s> to use analog playback instead of digital 1 in windows media player on the tools menu click options </s>
<s> 2 on the devices tab click properties for the cd rom or dvd rom drive that is being used for playback </s>
<s> 3 under playback click analog </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but thought i would check </s>
<s> i do not believe you can hear anything through the cd rom headphone jack while an application has control of the drive </s>
<s> you must turn off mp or other player and use the play button on the cd rom </s>
<s> you can go so far as disconnecting the ide cable and trying the drive as a stand alone cd player </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> actually i am trying to use a commercial cd fleetwood mac rumours to be exact </s>
<s> i did go in and specifically set the drive to analog </s>
<s> it was in digital so i had to change it </s>
<s> is is possible there isn t sufficient output power or whatever from the cd rom itself to drive the koss headphones </s>
<s> it did work when i listened from the sound card output but then that wasn t what i wanted </s>
<s> ron </s>
<s> interesting however there isn t a play button on the drive </s>
<s> only the insert eject volume and the jack </s>
<s> i wondered about the program control and if it would have an effect that s why i was wondering if there was a utility that would cause the player to be used on it s own specifically for using the output jack </s>
<s> thanks ron </s>
<s> it sure seems to me that it s still in digital mode or the front panel is just too weak </s>
<s> here s how i test such </s>
<s> i unplug the small cd analog cable </s>
<s> here s a picture gt bob </s>
<s> when the jack is inserted into the quot socket quot on the front of the cd rom possibly the jack on your headset is not the corect one </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> to feed the analog music signal to the output on the front of the drive </s>
<s> they can fail </s>
<s> i had a friend with a dell that had that exact problem while under warranty lol </s>
<s> bob had to take an end run </s>
<s> wouldn t let me post further in that last one </s>
<s> i ll give the cable disconnect a try and make a trip to radio shack tomorrow and see if i can find an inexpensive set of headphones suitable for the pc </s>
<s> maybe the koss headphones need a little more output power </s>
<s> i ll let you know </s>
<s> ron </s>
<s> don t blame the earphone </s>
<s> if the light on the drive is blinking then you have either a defective volume control or a defective output jack </s>
<s> hmmm ok then i ll pose that one with dell also </s>
<s> thanks art </s>
<s> ron </s>
<s> ray i assume that you refer to the digital to analog </s>
<s> if so then i did try that </s>
<s> it would then go along with what art posted and i responded that i will now bring that up with dell also in addition to the sound anomaly </s>
<s> thanks ron </s>
