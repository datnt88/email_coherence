<s> ok here s the deal </s>
<s> i have the abit nf7 with a xp 2500 cpu </s>
<s> i have 2 gigs of ram and a ati radeon x800 pro 256 mb </s>
<s> i have 550 watt psu </s>
<s> i want the abuse the hell out of my video card </s>
<s> i wanna see graphics that i see in magazines ok maybe not that great but i wanna run things that are running at 30 fps on low settings to 75 fps on higher settings </s>
<s> i know that it s my mobo and cpu that s holding this creature back </s>
<s> any recommendations for a good combo that supports agp </s>
<s> i don t wanna spend more than 300 to do so either </s>
<s> i wanna upgrade so that this video card does backflips instead of running at similar fps as my old radeon 8000 i know that my old video card was nice and all but this one should set it on fire then eat it while it s still burning so i thought when i bought it haha </s>
<s> oh i m willing to check out either amd or intel </s>
<s> i guess what i m asking is what motherboard and cpu did they use to get the pictures they have on the box or which will do that </s>
<s> please help me out and thanks in advance </s>
<s> download ati tool and overclock the card </s>
<s> then try to unlock the four locked pixel pipes </s>
<s> download ati tool here google the unlo0cking part </s>
<s> unlocking the pipes isn t gonna have as big of an impact as changing the mobo cpu though </s>
<s> i ve tweaked around with my video card and have tried what you suggested buto nly to have a 3 5 fps increase there has to be some way to make my games like close to the way they do on the box anyways i ll just do some research on good motherboards for agp video cards or something </s>
<s> along with overclocking your gpu </s>
<s> buying a new cpu board won t make your fps 70 for that you ll need an x1900 7900 along with a new cpu and board </s>
<s> so people are not seeming to understand what i m looking for i ve overclocked my video card in attempts to make it faster </s>
<s> it didn t change but 2 5 fps i am looking for replacement of old mobo cpu </s>
<s> the nf7 was bought around 3 years ago </s>
<s> maybe longer and the cpu at the same time </s>
<s> the fbs of the cpu is 333 probably 266 though not 100 sure it s some old stuff processor i m looking at is the p4 3 40ghz some mobos i am looking at are listed below asus p4s800d x msi pm8m v mach speed matrix p4m800 help me out here please </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> get an athlon 64 athlon 64 x2 </s>
<s> the fact that they run a lot cooler than p4 s is just gravy </s>
<s> if you give me your budget for a cpu board i ll recommend one for you </s>
<s> however i ve said it before and i ll say it again a new cpu and board will not take you from 35 to 70fps for that you ll need a new graphics card </s>
<s> and if you get an a64 you ll want to get a motherboard with a pcie slot so you ll need a new graphics card </s>
<s> agp is obselete so i wouldn t waste my money on a new board with only an agp slot </s>
