<s> i was wondering how much effect raises your ram does for your pc </s>
<s> right now i have a 1 gb of pc2100 ddr </s>
<s> my question is if i bought 2 sticks of dual channel ram at pc3200 ddr </s>
<s> would it increase my speed by a large amount </s>
<s> my specs 2 53 pentuim 1 gb ram 80 gb hard drive 480 power supply radeon 9800 pro </s>
<s> you need to verify under your manual or latest info from the vendor mtrbd </s>
<s> support website what memory can be installed </s>
<s> then proceed to get some benefit from faster ram however it also ties in with the cpu as well as a good match with fsb speed </s>
<s> even if the cpu won t help the benefit will be there but don t expect a quot gee whiz effect quot in other words quot wow quot </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
