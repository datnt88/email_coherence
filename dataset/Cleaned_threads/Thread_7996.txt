<s> hello guys sorry if this has been asked before or if this is in the wrong forum but i figure i ll at least be pointed in the right direction </s>
<s> my computer has an 80 gig hardrive in it partitioned into 62 5 and 17 5 gigs worth of unallocated space the result of getting rid of a linux partition </s>
<s> now i d like to be able to use that 17 5 gigs to store files on but i don t want to pay for partition magic or any other similar programs </s>
<s> are there any working free methods out there and should i format it to fat or ntfs </s>
<s> boot with that in and go through the steps to format that partition </s>
<s> of course a reformat and install would return it to 1 partition </s>
<s> but you would need to back up everything to another source that you didn t want to lose </s>
<s> and make sure you have all drivers needed </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> thanks but that s another thing i d like to avoid having to back everything up and etc </s>
