<s> whenever i try to access a my tablet pc running windows vista 32 bit from my desktop running windows 7 64 bit i get a password prompt however i cannot login with the login used on my tablet or my desktop </s>
<s> i get the same problem if i try to access the desktop from my pc </s>
<s> they are in the same workgroup and password protected sharing is off what else could be causing this problem </s>
<s> do you have an account on that machine </s>
<s> more issues are covered at yes you wrote password protected sharing is off but that does not mean you don t need an account on the other machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes i have accounts on both machines with administrative privileges </s>
<s> the reason i am trying to access one another is so i can keep my music folder synchronized between the two using synctoy </s>
<s> and be absolutely sure of firewalls even the one in some routers </s>
<s> i didn t see where you check that other link </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t see exactly how that can help me unless you are just trying to say that you can t help me with this </s>
<s> i followed the steps on here and it still doesn t help </s>
<s> you had completed the changes at that site </s>
<s> this leaves us with firewalls in any machine or router and security suites too </s>
<s> yes i can t help you </s>
<s> i am not there to do all this for you </s>
<s> there are quite a long list of things that can be wrong and what confounds some is why those that help can t just tell which item is wrong </s>
<s> what works is if we keep going down the list </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i turned off both firewalls and still no progress </s>
<s> i am not sure if the firewall of the network adapter could be causing problem it is a mac time capsule which i can guarantee is running the default settings </s>
<s> what is next on the list </s>
<s> not a network adapter so something was lost in translation there </s>
<s> here s a windows nugget </s>
<s> create the shares after the accounts </s>
<s> i ve run into this oddity if the share was made and later i straightened out the accounts </s>
<s> since there is an apple device consider installing bonjour from bob </s>
<s> is it possible to create accounts for different domains though and if so how </s>
<s> also time capsules are also wireless network adapters </s>
<s> when makers rewrite the networking book we ll have to match the old names to what they write today </s>
<s> that s a bridge mode and can harbor a firewall </s>
<s> domains are going to tax even the most season it staff as the domain servers must be configured just so </s>
<s> but i wonder if you have confused domains with workgroups </s>
<s> if you have different workgroup names you have to correct that </s>
