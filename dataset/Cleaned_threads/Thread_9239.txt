<s> thanks a lot for your advises i would like to inform you that i tried to install quot autorun eater quot which i downloaded from cnet and mcafee alerts me that the zip file includes a trojan </s>
<s> best regards </s>
<s> there are affiliate download links that are known to have trojans </s>
<s> download com is clean so far </s>
<s> there is also some tools that norton and others will balk at </s>
<s> this is one of them since it installs a handler and an av may not like that </s>
<s> this is as far as i ll explain it </s>
<s> for a deep explaination see our spyware forum </s>
<s> here it s solving the pest issue </s>
<s> and in closing mcafee is not good enough yet to stop this new breed of pests </s>
<s> seems a shame it would paint the cure but not the pest </s>
