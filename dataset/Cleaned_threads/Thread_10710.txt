<s> hey i have a fairly great computer with a gtx660 and a i7 3770 but lately one monitor just seems too little so im upgrading my gpu to a gtx 690 and adding a few monitors to my setup </s>
<s> but of course like any sensable person i want to be sure that if i put in a 690 it wont everything up with bottlenecking my cpu so is a i7 3770 capable of keeping up with gtx 690 </s>
<s> the i7 3770 cpu should have no problem at all keeping up with it </s>
<s> more of a concern would be the power supply </s>
<s> that card calls for a 650 watt minimum supply it says at full load it draws about 300 watts </s>
<s> quot our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a 225 lga 1155 core i5 2500k and a 1000 lga 2011 core i7 3960x even when three way graphics card configurations are involved </s>
<s> it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don t hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge based machines </s>
