<s> i m at a loss i really am </s>
<s> i don t remember when this problem started but vista home basic won t display certain web pages </s>
<s> the model is an emachine walmart special which i bought in february this year 2007 the model is w3611 </s>
<s> it is completely unmodified i de crapified it and installed grisoft avg and it updates automatically </s>
<s> the only two webpages is doesn t display so far </s>
<s> is and </s>
<s> i ve been told both these pages are heavy with java script just this evening i installed the latest java update but there s no change </s>
<s> when it won t load the page i mean it won t load </s>
<s> i type in and i get this i can click on the correct link at the top and then i get the screen that says internet explorer cannot display page </s>
<s> then gives some options for quot fixing quot it </s>
<s> there s no connection problem either </s>
<s> i have wireless and it s always on </s>
<s> i have just this evening discovered i can bring up a cached page but it has aspects of the page that s missing </s>
<s> here is the link i checked my security settings and they are not too high </s>
<s> if someone can shed any light on this problem please do </s>
<s> i really need to get information from the ftc website thanks </s>
<s> charlene </s>
<s> if not then i suspect something with the new internet explorer version 7 is breaking them </s>
<s> however i use windows xp and both sites work with my ie7 </s>
<s> if they did work with your windows vista and with ie7 then there has been some change to your system that has broken ie7 for these sites </s>
<s> does this happen only on these two sites or does it happen with other sites as well </s>
<s> as a short term measure see if you can get access to these two sites with another browser </s>
<s> internet explorer isn t the only type of browser we can use on windows and there are other good ones available </s>
<s> mozilla has one called firefox at </s>
<s> it is compatible with windows vista and doesn t affect using ie for other sites if that is what you wish </s>
<s> if firefox does not allow you to access these sites then i suspect some software is blocking your computer from accessing them </s>
<s> do you have any anti spyware software installed </s>
<s> mark </s>
<s> go into a command windows and type ping lt enter key gt and ping post your output here copy paste or retype whatever you like </s>
<s> it might take you more time to find out how to copy and paste from the command window than just retyping it </s>
<s> installing java surely doesn t solve the problem if it s javascript related </s>
<s> those are totally different technologies </s>
<s> it s like putting more air in the tyres of your car when you ran out of gas doesn t help </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> short answer only what came installed with the computer out of the box </s>
<s> i did ping ftc gov and got a quot timed out quot response three separate times </s>
<s> i m stumped </s>
<s> what does that mean </s>
<s> they don t want to be pinged </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> this will take some time to straighten out </s>
<s> if your pressed for time skip to the last item </s>
<s> when was the last time you did a defragmentation and error check on your computer </s>
<s> if you don t have registry repair software get one from this site if this fails this is a trouble shooter for ie7 from microsoft if this fails you may wish to reinstall ie7 java and adobe one of them may have a corrupt file in them that is blocking your access to these sites </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> sorry for the delay </s>
<s> i got distracted by another answer </s>
<s> i get a time out also on but it also tells me the ip address that s being pinged 69 46 230 66 and if i enter that in my browsers address bar i get to an advertisement site directnicparking com </s>
<s> however if i type i get to the ftc site </s>
<s> can you try that </s>
<s> if it works it might solve halve of your problem </s>
<s> authorityresearch com is 209 216 253 192 it pings ok but this ip address in the address bar leads to a general page of a company called plesk presumably their hosting provider </s>
<s> the first thing i would do to sort this out is find a laptop where you can view both these sites elsewhere </s>
<s> then connect it to the same internet connection either wired or wireless as this erroneous pc and see what happens </s>
<s> if the same error occurs with this laptop at your place and not elsewhere it seems an error with your isp or router </s>
<s> if the laptop is ok with you it s a problem in your pc </s>
<s> you check the hosts file but that s an unlikely cause or run it without any internet security program </s>
<s> the most likely way to solve it is to do a clean install of windows xp and start all over with your machine </s>
<s> while you install additional software keep checking if things go wrong and you might find out the cause </s>
<s> but just as well everything goes ok up to the end and the problem is solved forever </s>
<s> be sure to make a system restore point to go back to if it re appears </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> federal trade commission of feedthechildren both sites are up and running as i type jonah </s>
<s> i downloaded firefox from mozilla and the ftc site still won t load </s>
<s> firefox says quot the ftc site has taken too long to respond quot and quot there might be a problem with your internet connection quot in a pig s eye this is tooo much </s>
<s> i went to internet options and reset ie to all default settings </s>
<s> what is up </s>
<s> yes i know they are that s why this is so frustrating for me </s>
<s> i need the ftc website to complete my research </s>
<s> can someone help me </s>
<s> i have visited the vista website and can t find what i need </s>
<s> i have visited the windows website too </s>
<s> and have them run diagnostics on your connection </s>
<s> do you have diagnostics for your ethernet adapter run them first and try again </s>
<s> then contact your ip for assistance this maybe there problem or the way your adapter is working with your connection </s>
<s> this is probably too late as i see your post date was quite some time ago but i see no one mentioned this fix that has worked for me several times </s>
<s> hold the windwos key press r this brings up the run command window </s>
<s> type in msconfig and hit enter </s>
<s> this brings up the system configuration utility </s>
<s> click the startup tab and check the box disable all </s>
<s> click the services tab make sure that you check the hide all microsoft services and then click disable all for the remaining ones </s>
<s> reboot your computer it is now running only the stuff microsoft intended windows the start up with </s>
<s> try your browser now if it was software interferance there is a good chance this will fix the problem </s>
<s> especially if your computer is a brand name one like toshiba acer dell etc they always stack the computer with their garbage software right out of the box and sometimes it has issues with what the user is trying to do </s>
<s> i created a cnet membership only so that i could thank you for posting this solution </s>
<s> i m not charliegirl obviously but i have the same problem </s>
<s> for a while turning my firewall off would allow me to access some sites that work on my xp machine but not on my vista machine </s>
<s> but i tried your solution and so far it seems to be working </s>
<s> i have a sneaking suspicion that counterspy might have been part of the problem a service i disabled </s>
<s> but the computer is running much better now </s>
<s> and a site that wasn t loading before one i need for work is now working fine with the firewall on and working </s>
<s> sigh </s>
<s> thank you </s>
