<s> i just upgraded from win98se to xp pro and i can t find a driver for my gateway keyboard model 7001211 </s>
<s> gateway s website has a driver for newer keyboards and i downloaded one which i thought would work but no such luck </s>
<s> i visited microsoft s website and they didn t have anything of any use either </s>
<s> suggestions </s>
<s> microsoft will supply basic keyboard functionality so no keyboard driver is required </s>
<s> looking to microsoft for gateway support would a frustrating waste of time </s>
<s> maybe you didn t write what said driver would do </s>
<s> drivers get things working </s>
<s> in the case of a keyboard not so much a driver but a keyboard enhancer not a driver </s>
<s> is what some are looking for </s>
<s> the difference is there and be sure you are looking for the right software </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> your thoughts are greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i didn t think about the difference between a driver or some enhancements </s>
<s> the keyboard does work but the internet multimedia keys won t work since upgrading to xp pro </s>
<s> i m going to visit gateway again </s>
<s> thanks denny </s>
