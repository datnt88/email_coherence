<s> here is what i would like to do </s>
<s> i want to have a machine running xp pro with a shared drive visible on the network but have no one logged on to that machine </s>
<s> this is will allow the other machines to access the network drive and to administer the machine i can remote in from one of the other pcs </s>
<s> is this possible without logging in </s>
<s> thanks michael </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> but let s define quot logging on quot if you mean quot must the windows gui be logged in quot that is the name and password on the host be entered where you see the start button then the answer changes to quot yes quot but under the hood there is a login occurring when a client connects and asks for connection to a share </s>
<s> how deep must we go here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what i want is a small pc running xp pro </s>
<s> when it boots no one logs on to the pc but the drive on the pc is shared to the network </s>
<s> the other 3 computers running xp pro need to access this shared drive </s>
<s> this is in a peer to peer network so there is no server involved </s>
<s> i m trying to do this without having to put a client server environment in this really small office </s>
<s> they don t need the security </s>
<s> i was planning on not hooking a monitor to the pc and remoting in from one of the other pcs to administer the box if necessary </s>
<s> does this help </s>

<s> it sat in a corner on the floor with nothing attached but a keyboard </s>
<s> we could use the keyboard to turn it on or wol and it could be shut down remotely </s>
<s> what we did was pre define all users needing access including the administrator account and then recreate these same accounts on the pcs that would gain access </s>
<s> the shares were setup and permissions assigned to those who needed access </s>
<s> when done properly a user could login to a remote pc that already had an account on that quot server quot device </s>
<s> they could navigate to an authorized share and would not be asked for a username password </s>
<s> another way to do this would be to map the shares as needed to remote pcs or create shortcuts on the desktop </s>
<s> in this way the accessible shares were only visible when logged into these specific accounts </s>
<s> this only seems to work with windows smb but not remotely using ftp </s>
<s> be aware that xp pro has a ten user login limit </s>
<s> because of the 10 user limit and the need to accommodate more students at once we went to a windows xp embedded nas drive that allowed 25 simultaneous users </s>
<s> these devices however cannot be used like pcs </s>
<s> they don t run software or third party utilities </s>
<s> the one we got has remote administration capability and can be set up for remote ftp or http access over the web </s>
<s> it also resides in a relay rack </s>
<s> since all the machines logon using the same user id then it should be possible to map to the quot not logged on quot box without a problem </s>
<s> we don t really need a lot of security so the user id is all the same </s>
<s> i will keep working on this this gives me some more ideas </s>
<s> thanks michael </s>
<s> once you issue the share in windows you don t need to log on that machine for the share to function </s>
<s> however from the client machine there is a log on process so what wipes some beginning networkers is that you must have a log on account on the machine you are logging into as well as on the machine that is sharing </s>
<s> i won t rewrite this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> since all the machines use the same logon this should be easy just don t log that particular machine on in the morning and remotely administer it </s>
<s> thanks for the help everyone </s>
<s> michael </s>
<s> and not just a network attached storage drive </s>
<s> why waste an xp license and a good piece of hardware if you just want access to files in shares </s>
<s> a nas that supports windows smb will do that quite well </s>
<s> remote administration is a minimal chore </s>
<s> you need to turn it on off create delete shares add remove users and do backups not much more </s>
<s> they don t need much in the way of resources and can be quite small </s>
<s> i have been looking into nas for this situation as well </s>
<s> i cannot seem to find a reliable reasonably priced nas that will suite their needs </s>
<s> i have been reading a lot of reviews on different nas devices and some people love them and some hate them </s>
<s> wasting an xp license isn t really a problem </s>
<s> i have extra one at the moment and also have a licensed copy of windows 2000 that i no longer use </s>
<s> i m still researching all possibilities and haven t ruled the nas out yet </s>
<s> i also need the system easy for them to switch to a backup incase the nas or pc dies </s>
<s> thanks michael </s>
<s> while you can t install to a partition over 127gb just like xp it handles the big drives once the service pack is added just fine </s>
<s> it boots faster than xp and from memory allows more connections than xp </s>
