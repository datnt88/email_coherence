<s> i ve got a 1gb hp pav processor and am supposed to have 128mb of sdram only 92 mb show up on the performance tab </s>
<s> any ideas where my memory has gotten to </s>
<s> i ve tried shutting down down drivers one at a time to find a change no dice </s>
<s> do you have a separate video card or is this on your mb </s>
<s> if the later your ram might be shared with video and your system will not report that portion </s>
<s> your system probably uses build in video which uses system ram for its own reserved use </s>
<s> in some cases you can that value to suit your needs </s>
<s> it then either uses some vendor utility or the setting value in the bios </s>
<s> you can t defeat it if you continue to use the build in video </s>
<s> otherwise if capable get a video card that directly installs and uses it own ram </s>
<s> you needn t woryy about it and you add more ram if you have available ram slots open or swap out the ram for a larger mb size in its place </s>
<s> hope this helps good luck willy </s>
