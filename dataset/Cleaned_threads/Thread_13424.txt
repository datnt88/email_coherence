<s> i have a maxtor one touch 500g external hard drive </s>
<s> i m running windows xp with norton 360 utilities </s>
<s> well norton said i need to defragment my hard drives to optimize the performance </s>
<s> so i did </s>
<s> it took a long time to do it and now when i try to access the files on my external it says they are corrupted and unreadable </s>
<s> i keep my pictures and music on there from itunes and cd s so i don t take up space on my internal </s>
<s> i m a little frustated but is there anyway to get my stuff back or do i just need to start over by reformatting the drive back to original </s>
<s> and if i am able to salvage the drive should i just not defragment it again </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help </s>
<s> here s what i m finding </s>
<s> these externals arrive is fat32 format </s>
<s> that s not a bad thing since the drive will work on apple most versions of windows without having to do a thing </s>
<s> however fat32 is fragile and if you do something that is hard work or the cable comes unplugged at the wrong moment the files or the entire drive can become corrupt </s>
<s> fixes </s>
<s> 1 for most windows use ntfs </s>
<s> it s a journaled file system and damage resistant not damage proof </s>
<s> 2 if there are any issues with the drive connections power pc don t defragment it </s>
<s> even a machine with bad ram will nicely corrupt internal drives </s>
<s> sorry it s too late so start over and don t defrag unless you have to and you are ready with a backup plan </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i guess i know what i m going to be doing this weekend </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
