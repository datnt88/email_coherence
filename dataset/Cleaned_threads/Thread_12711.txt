<s> i m using win xp sp2 and have just reformatted </s>
<s> but then it my computer will crash freeze like every hour and becoming more frequent until recently it will crash every time right after i startup windows when i turn on my comp </s>
<s> every time right before the crash freeze occur i would hear a slight clicking sound from my comp sounded like its from the hd not the floppy </s>
<s> then after i restart i will get the message disk boot failure insert system disk and press enter </s>
<s> i then check the boot options on my bios and notice it isnt detecting my hd </s>
<s> but my floppy which is what i have set as a priority to boot from is detected </s>
<s> ive always had the floppy as the primary boot drive for the past few years and no problem until i recently reformatted </s>
<s> so now im just wondering what the problem is </s>
<s> is it my hd my operating system or something else </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> did you try a new hard disk </s>
<s> have had this same problem when installing a new motherboard in an e machine </s>
<s> the ide cable was to short and was not in the motherboard all the way </s>
<s> if you moved your cables around inside your computer it is more than likely the formentioned problem </s>
<s> ok dumb question you dont happen to have a floppy inserted d you </s>
<s> have you physically checked your hd </s>
<s> check the disc itself for scratches or indentations </s>
<s> and yes you will need to try another hard drive in your mobo </s>
<s> have yu tried a different port </s>
<s> have you set the jumpers correctly </s>
<s> spoon </s>
<s> unplug it then plug it into the motherboard again </s>
<s> check those jumper settings </s>
<s> if there not right it wont go </s>
<s> it should boot from the c drive first not the floppy </s>
<s> might need a new drive </s>
<s> do the above first then find a spare and test to see if it s shot </s>
<s> if it beeps see the beep codes at the manufactures web site </s>
<s> these will tell you where the trouble is maybe </s>
<s> this thread is untracked </s>
<s> if it isn t installed already </s>
<s> did you try a boot floppy and did it booted ok you didn t mention </s>
