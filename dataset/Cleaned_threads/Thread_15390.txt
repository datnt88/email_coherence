<s> hey bob yeah i have got it down to the cpu hsf power supply unit psu motherboard and the speaker but still no beep from the speaker </s>
<s> dont know what to do next </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> paul </s>
<s> at this point the possible bad parts in order of cost are 1 speaker </s>
<s> 2 psu </s>
<s> 3 motherboard </s>
<s> 4 cpu hsf </s>
<s> there is a simple part on the motherboard that should be checked with a voltmeter and that is the bios battery </s>
<s> if it s the usual cr2032 then anything below 2 8 or so volts means you get another </s>
<s> at this point you ve scoured the board for the jumpers that you ve checked are all in the right places </s>
<s> i always make sure the speaker is a good one </s>
<s> but my next move is cardboard </s>
<s> remove the motherboard from the case since some builders may install too many metal standoffs and short out the backside of the motherboard </s>
<s> place the four parts on the cardboard and set it up </s>
<s> flip the ac on and use a spare jumper to power up the affair </s>
<s> no beeps </s>
<s> if you have a voltmeter you can see if the psu has the correct voltage on each pin </s>
<s> if not another psu is obtained always oversize the watts </s>
<s> and the test repeated </s>
<s> then the motherboard and then the cpu hsf </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hey again i tried the cardboard and everything </s>
<s> nothing is working </s>
<s> i think i am just going to have to buy a new combo </s>
<s> i will tell you this however when i first took the heatsink off the cpu was practically glued to the back of the heatsink </s>
<s> in other words i didnt have to undo the latch to take the cpu out it came out when the cpu came off </s>
<s> do you think this could have done something to the cpu or the quot cpu holder quot on the mother board </s>
<s> is there anyway to test the cpu to see if it is still ok </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> there are no tests in the field except for swap and retest </s>
<s> if you don t have spare parts frankly if the cpu and hsf came out without unlatching but words haven t conveyed what a picture would </s>
<s> a real problem is that a faulty psu could have caused this as well as a loose screw or other conductive item in the machine </s>
<s> sorry i couldn t tell if it s good bad without placing into a working machine </s>
<s> bob </s>
