<s> before i pay for a disk recovery service i was wondering if anyone has had problems with xp and the 1394 fire wire maxtor 80 gb external hard drive </s>
<s> i use this drive to store music and pictures </s>
<s> i was in the process of backing this up to a different maxtor one touch 250gb hard drive when i received an error and my computer froze </s>
<s> after rebooting unplugging the firewire cables i was no longer able to see the 80gb drive </s>
<s> unfortunately only half of my 75gb worth of data was saved on my 250gb drive </s>
<s> anyone help </s>
<s> also can you removed the hard drive from the external case and plug it into a ide controller internally and make it a slave drive </s>
<s> thank you all </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> you ll find some reports of such </s>
<s> i know this may be too late but can i ask where the backup was for this system </s>
<s> hard disks of the consumer variety are designed to last 5 years </s>
<s> and some won t make it that long </s>
<s> we must save what we can t lost on our backup media </s>

<s> bob thanks for your help </s>
<s> i had no problems removing the hard drive from the case and hooking it up to the ide channel internally </s>

<s> i read somewhere about trying the knoppix cd </s>
<s> thanks again for your help </s>
<s> it supports a wider variety of disk formats </s>
