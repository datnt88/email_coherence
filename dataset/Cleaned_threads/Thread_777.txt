<s> i dont wanna blow my mouse up when i plug in the us outlet because i paid around 75 euroos for and i want to use that blue tooth when i have a blue tooth phone to tranfer things </s>
<s> why no details about the adapter </s>
<s> such 110 to 240 or such adapters are common for many devices </s>
<s> most of the time it s just common sense to get the right setup </s>
<s> but with such a lacking detail post plus the fact it works there isn t much to comment about except missing details </s>
