<s> hi i ve got a gateway desktop that i ve upgraded the operating system to windows 7 64 bit </s>
<s> it worked fine for the past month and all of a sudden it started turning itself off as if someone has pressed the off button </s>
<s> when i turn it back on it asks me if i want to reboot in safe mode </s>
<s> i ve recently tried installing a new printer but the same issue occurs when i have unplugged my printer </s>
<s> it does the same thing whether it s actively being used or being left unattended </s>
<s> i don t think it s an overheating issue because it s located in a relatively cold room </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you still need to consider overheating at component level or a malfunctioning stressed power supply </s>
<s> don t guess look </s>
<s> check the heat sink fan and cooling fins </s>
<s> i ve seen them so clogged you couldn t see the fins </s>
<s> i turned the machine back on this morning and it won t even boot now </s>
<s> it asks me to either start windows normally or restore </s>
<s> when i choose start windows normally the window logos shows up and then it freezes </s>
<s> when i choose restore it loads the file and when it s completed it freezes </s>
<s> my guess is that it s probably a driver issue with the new drive updates that i recently installed </s>
<s> am i correct </s>
<s> try quot last known good configuration quot </s>
<s> try taking the case off </s>
<s> did your problem occure when you installed the new drive updates </s>
<s> if so you might have damaged your hard drive </s>
<s> jerry </s>
<s> i ve set the machine aside for the past few days and it boots again </s>
<s> i m deleting the programs and drivers that i ve installed recently and hopefully it won t turn itself off again </s>
