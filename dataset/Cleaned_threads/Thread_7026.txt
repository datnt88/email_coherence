<s> winxp sp3 ram 2gb hd 160gb when i first time put my memory stick of my camcorder into the slot of the case of my computer it jolly well recognizes it and the contents get displayed very well </s>
<s> i use safely remove hardware icon and then remove the stick from the slot </s>
<s> now supposing i want to use the memory stick again the slot does not recognize it </s>
<s> i have to reboot the pc and then it gets recognized </s>
<s> this cycle remove reboot remains the only solution to me at the moment </s>
<s> this is true for all the memory sticks i do have here </s>
<s> kindly guide if this problem could be solved </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> i used to safely remove hardware all the time then i was told if it is usb 2 0 don t bother </s>
<s> so i stopped </s>
<s> is it true not sure but i have never had a problem </s>
<s> so try that first as you may be turning off your usb port each time also make sure that you are not having conflicting drives </s>
<s> i had a mapped drive set to e and everytime i plugged in a memory stick i never knew if it was going to recognise it </s>
<s> hope that helps </s>
<s> there is a simple solution for this in the case of windows </s>
<s> just do a quot regedit quot for storagedevicepolicies key </s>
<s> get into the registry press start gt run enter regedit press ok click on my computer </s>
<s> then press file export give some file name to backup the registry </s>
<s> just in caseyou ever need to rollback </s>
<s> navigate to hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset control storagedevicepolicies </s>
<s> in the right pane select quot writeprotect quot </s>
<s> reset the value to 0 repeat the same for controlset001 and controlset002 incase they exist </s>
<s> now plug in your usb drives and it should work </s>
<s> else just reboot the machine and try </s>
<s> i m running windows xp pro with sp3 and have noticed some problems removing usb devices even when i use microsoft s quot safely remove quot option </s>
<s> i came across a program called quot usb safely remove quot which monitors each of your usb devices that you put into use </s>
<s> this program sits in your tool bar when it is running </s>
<s> if you want to remove a usb item you just quot mouse over quot the icon and a window pops up showing all of your usb items that are connected </s>
<s> to disconnect one of the usb drives just click on it and it will safely remove it for you </s>
<s> if it has problems stopping the device it will pop up a window and show you the program that is keeping it from quot un mounting quot in a safe manner </s>
<s> this program comes in handy when i use a flash card reader that can read about 12 different types of flash cards </s>
<s> when i plug it in about 6 different letters show up </s>
<s> using usb safely remove i don t have a problem trying to decide which letter i need to stop to safely remove my flash card reader </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> here is the link for the website cheers </s>
<s> i was having this same issue </s>
<s> what i figured out was by using quot safely remove hardware quot i was basically turning off that drive </s>
<s> problem was it didn t come back until i rebooted </s>
<s> my work around was to skip the quot safely remove quot and just wait a few minutes for the memory card to finish it s work before removing from the slot </s>
<s> that took care of the problem </s>
