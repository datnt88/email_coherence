<s> my os is windows 7 p5k premium motherboard ive had this system stable for almost 2 years its not newly built </s>
<s> i recenlty bought a new monitor and my computer was shut down </s>
<s> i removed the old dvi cable from the old monitor that was hooked to the video card and then hooked the new dvi from the new monitor </s>
<s> then pressed power on the computer then it wouldn t start makes wierd noises and all the fans are slightly twitching even psu and cpu fans and the case fans which had leds on them flickered really fast it looked as if it was possessed or something i cant keep it on too long because im worried about the cpu frying although it may be dead already what can i do to diagnose the problem </s>
<s> edit i tried it again and the psu fan does spin but not cpu or any other fan however if i have a 3 fan speed knob on the case fans and when i move it to highest speed or something the fan begins to spin and will stay spinning also led on these fan still are flashing also before this problem when i presseed power all the fans go full speed for a few seconds then stop for 1 second or so and then start up normally </s>
<s> now they go full speed and then just stop or twitch </s>
<s> reconnect and try the old monitor and old cable </s>
<s> at least you will know if your computer is still a ok </s>
<s> i tried the old monitor i also tried unplugging the video card radeon 3850 256mb also cleared cmos removed everything put it back same deal one time the cpu fan did start to spin and stayed spinning but accessories keyboard were not powering up nor was the hard drive i dont think </s>
