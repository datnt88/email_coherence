<s> hey all i ve purchased an atlon 1 6 ghz 256mb ram everything was running smoothly on it however each time i installed a game when i played it i sometimes receiced some reboots this was starting to become a concern and a bother cause 20 min on your game the computer reboot at random times i though maybe it was because i overclocked my cpu so i went in the bios and reset everything in default now when my pc boots up again it will allways reboot before hitting to windowsxp and on occasions when i hit delete to go back to bios it reboots if i leave the computer on it will keep on doing a cycle reboot and ask me to run on safe more or normal mode </s>
