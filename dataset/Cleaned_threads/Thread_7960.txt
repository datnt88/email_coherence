<s> hey there </s>
<s> i have a compaq presario sr1300an </s>
<s> the spec s are i am wondering is this computer worth being upgraded </s>
<s> or should i build a new one </s>
<s> i am interested in using it for gaming browsing listening to music windows live messenger </s>
<s> should i just buy a whole new pc or just build one </s>
<s> if so can you help me find a cheap setup </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> when you change the motherboard the os that came with the compaq usually fails </s>
<s> at a few hundred bucks it can be the deal breaker </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> upgrade to a proprietary computer such as a compaq dell hp etc </s>
<s> you can reuse some of the components however the first major problem is the nifty little cases they use </s>
<s> simply too small to adequately cool any of the improvements you would want to make </s>
<s> start with a new case under 60 </s>
<s> best to buy one sans power supply and buy a separate supply that you verify has all the power needed as well as connectors needed for new mobos videos etc </s>
<s> very possible that your dell doesn t even have a slot for a video card which right there kills gaming </s>
<s> the fsb shows as 333 mhz which can t be upgraded without getting a new mobo </s>
<s> you don t want to get involved finding out if the dell mobo is wired for a standard atx v2 supply or pay an arm and a leg for one from them </s>
<s> go to newegg and check prices </s>
<s> yep you will have to buy a new op sys xp pro with sp2b oem cd from newegg is 139 </s>
<s> home is 89 </s>
<s> about all i plan to salvage from my old compaq is the case and even that will need some sheet metal work </s>
<s> ever time i try and start a build price it out i find that buying a new os must be real and complete causes the price to go up to the point i can buy for cheaper then i can build it </s>
<s> i usally stop and decide to live with what i have </s>
<s> try here for more general info look at my reply quot basic things to watch for when buying quot </s>
<s> the off the shelf computer you have now has a cheap motherboard and processor so most other parts will be selected on price rather than quality </s>
<s> by using a top class motherboard and processor these parts will have a 3 year warranty </s>
<s> a 400w 500w power supply in a large atx case for better airflow is needed to run a good video card </s>
<s> use either a p4 or athlon 64 motherboard with the latest socket size </s>
<s> gaming computers need to be top of the line with at least 1 gig of ram and a core 2 duo processor or dual core processor </s>
<s> you will not be able to build a cheap system if you want to play the latest games </s>
<s> brand name computers are built to a price first and foremost this is why a lot of them give trouble </s>
<s> the moment you cut corners on price you cut quality </s>
<s> if cost is a real problem forget using it for serious gaming and put your present system into a larger case with a 400w power supply and install a dvd r rw so you can burn dvds and add 2x512 of ram discarding the 256 stick you may be able to trade it in if is lifetime warranty ram </s>
<s> doing this will be a cheap option that will improve your performance and allow you to play older games </s>
<s> with the adittion of a 300 video card more modern games can be played </s>
<s> have fun colo39 </s>
<s> computers is you don t have to worry about hardware mismatches and warranties </s>
<s> and you ve got that support on their websites which nowadays is often a live chat </s>
<s> if you build your own you run the risk of getting jipped and making mistakes that could cost you a lot of money </s>
<s> computers nowadays aren t at all what they were 10 years ago </s>
<s> i don t mean that in the speed and technology sense but in the quot do it yourself quot sense too </s>
<s> those complete brand name systems offer consumers a no hassle no nonsense high quality alternative to the run around and being shafted by people who just want your money </s>
<s> compaq may have a faster video card sound card more memory and faster chip for you on their web site that could cost you a lot less than a new computer </s>
<s> the situation in usa is different to australia as here computer shop builds of desktops are far superior to brand name </s>
<s> the pcuser magazine almost monthly set a set of criteria to build a desktop too and the larger computer shop builders always are superior and cheaper </s>
<s> only occasionally do brand name desktops get anywhere near the selected criterior that also includes price and performance </s>
<s> pc user magazine is the largest computer mag in australia and is highly regarded within the industry </s>
<s> many local computer shops are crooks here too so by getting a desktop built to a pc uers specification can be the only safe way to build a system if you are not very computer savy </s>
<s> when you buy a desktop here you get much more detail as to what is inside than usa sites i have looked at </s>
<s> good computer shops will give you a full 3 year hardware warranty as this is what good manufacturers give </s>
<s> a good shop will just replace any faulty parts and deal with the manufacturer for you </s>
<s> if components are sourced from a chinese supplier direct not a local agent this causes all the warranty problems </s>
<s> our overall pricing is cheaper here than usa our au is worth 75 cents us </s>
<s> overall computer salesman here are rated like car salesmen not reliable and they tell lies </s>
<s> a good honest local techie is hard to find especialy if you know about computer hardware and cannot be bluffed and lied to </s>
