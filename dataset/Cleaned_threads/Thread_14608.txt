<s> i started with a 20gb hard drive and just added a 120gb hard drive </s>
<s> everything is still on the 20gb </s>
<s> i use xp </s>
<s> where should i put files </s>
<s> should i keep xp on the 20gb and move all my data and programs to the 120gb </s>
<s> or vice versa </s>
<s> any ideas on this </s>
<s> one thing i will be doing is putting old hi8 tapes through my camcorder via firewire so i can convert them to dvd </s>
<s> i would assume i am best off transferring these to the 120gb as it is faster and larger </s>
<s> but should i move anything off my old slower 20gb hd would my system performance increase by moving everything over to the new drive </s>
<s> oh and how would i do any of this </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> quot where should i put files quot where you can find them </s>
<s> quot should i keep xp on the 20gb and move all my data and programs to the 120gb </s>
<s> or vice versa </s>
<s> any ideas on this quot i just did something similar </s>
<s> i used ghost2002 to copy a system from one drive to another removed the older slower drive as a backup and made the newer faster drive as the master and wher the os is and files are </s>
<s> much nicer and no big questions </s>

<s> i would assume i am best off transferring these to the 120gb as it is faster and larger quot you ll answer this soon enough since for each 2 hour home movie which is best limited to 1 hour your choice i see my temp workspace to be about 20 to 30 gb </s>
<s> this question will sort itself out as you will soon realise </s>
<s> quot but should i move anything off my old slower 20gb hd would my system performance increase by moving everything over to the new drive quot your choice </s>

<s> quot oh and how would i do any of this </s>
<s> quot i used ghost 2002 but the drive may have come with software and instructions to do this move </s>
<s> try that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the quick and helpful answers bob </s>
<s> i will move everything over to the new drive and then make it the master </s>
<s> is there a need to change anything in bios or do i just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up </s>
<s> as far as transferring data the new drive is a western digital and came with data lifeguard tools which should do the trick i believe </s>
<s> i will then use the old drive as my back up drive </s>
<s> is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a slave and back up to that on occasion </s>
<s> or is there a chance that if the system crashes both drives could be obliterated </s>
<s> and thanks for the tip about preferably limiting movie files to 1 hour </s>
<s> sorry to ask more questions on top of my questions </s>
<s> much appreciated </s>
<s> quot i will move everything over to the new drive and then make it the master </s>
<s> is there a need to change anything in bios or do i just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up quot too dependent on the machine in question </s>
<s> the last time i did this the bios settings were on auto and not even a jumper was moved because 80 conductor ide cables use the drives in cable select mode </s>
<s> quot as far as transferring data the new drive is a western digital and came with data lifeguard tools which should do the trick i believe quot i ve used that </s>
<s> seems to work for most </s>
<s> quot i will then use the old drive as my back up drive </s>
<s> is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a slave and back up to that on occasion </s>
<s> or is there a chance that if the system crashes both drives could be obliterated quot i removed the drive for various reasons </s>
<s> the drive was smaller and slower and created too many questions about where to store files </s>
<s> i didn t want to upgrade the power supply or worry about cooling issues </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> data on writeable devices is at risk during any disaster </s>
