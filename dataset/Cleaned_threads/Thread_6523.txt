<s> i have a desktop running xp home connected via ethernet cable to a microsoft mn 700 router access point </s>
<s> i also have a notebook running xp home with a wireless connection to the network </s>
<s> both computers can connect to the network just fine </s>
<s> file and print sharing is enabled on both and the workgroup name is the same on both computers yet when i m on one computer and both are on the network i can t see the other computer </s>
<s> any ideas on what the problem might be </s>
<s> xps built in firewall icf may be the limiting factor </s>
<s> try turning it off on both pcs </s>
<s> i had the same exact problem when first hooking up new xp desktop through router to laptops </s>
<s> it s the firewalls as mentioned you have to disable the built in xp firewall however you must also disable the firewall in norton internet security which comes preloaded in most xp s </s>
<s> once i disabled norton s firewall the whole network was ready </s>
<s> good luck </s>
