<s> sounds like the usual failures </s>
<s> these are usually usb powered so i carry in my kit bag a usb quot y quot cable to get more power to such drives </s>
<s> and it is very important on laptops to be on ac power when using such things </s>
<s> for desktops be sure to try the rear usb ports which have more power and something else i will skip discussing </s>
<s> if that fails don t panic yet </s>
<s> order a new usb enclosure and move the drive to the new enclosure if you must save your files </s>
<s> if you fret about the warranty then exercise that but your files won t be coming back </s>
<s> bob </s>
