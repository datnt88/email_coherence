<s> i know most modern laptop pcs have wireless capabilities so they can access the internet in any wi fi hotspot </s>
<s> however i would like to know how you can access a wi fi hotspot with a desktop pc </s>
<s> my parents live in an apartment complex that operates a wi fi hotspot </s>
<s> they only have a desktop pc and a very old one at that </s>
<s> my sister can access the internet with her laptop pc in the apartment </s>
<s> is it possible to connect a wireless router via ethernet to the desktop pc to take advantage of the hotspot </s>
<s> if so are there any extra settings or software required to access the hotspot with the desktop pc </s>
<s> sorry for being a bit of a newbie in the area of wireless routers but i ve always used wired routers and i don t have a laptop myself </s>
<s> my only experience with wireless internet access is with my 3g samsung blackjack ii smartphone not desktop pcs </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> is a wireless nic installed in a pci slot </s>
<s> or something from any other vendor or computer store </s>
<s> you will need to make sure that the pci wireless card has drivers for the operating system of the old computer </s>
<s> a couple of years ago i was in a similar situation and a belkin product wouldn t work on a computer with windows 98 on it where a linksys was ok that may be even more of a problem now </s>
<s> another solution would be an ordinary pci network card may need an old second hand one </s>
<s> and a wireless access point that can be setup as a wireless client </s>
