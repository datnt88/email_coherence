<s> i want to add more memory 256mb to my dell l500r but am stuck because both 100 mhz and 133 mhz are shown in any catalog refences for this machine </s>
<s> een when i consult dell on line i get both options </s>
<s> are they interchangeable </s>
<s> there sure seems to be a price difference </s>
<s> if i look at crucial com it takes pc100 so the faster memory should be fine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so which is faster </s>
<s> 100 mhz or 133 mhz </s>
<s> and are they interchangeable </s>
<s> what happens for example if i use 133 and the existing memory is 100 </s>
<s> doesn t work or runs slower </s>
<s> 133 is faster but if you mix both speeds it will run at 100 </s>
