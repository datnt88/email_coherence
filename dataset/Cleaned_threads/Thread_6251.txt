<s> i can get more details tonight but i thought i might see if anyone has a clue as too what is happening </s>
<s> i have a case with 8 hd s in it for storing hdtv files </s>
<s> a few nights ago i was looking at one of the drives from another pc using remote desktop and when i clicked on one of the folders it said it wasn t there don t remember the exact error or that was not accessible </s>
<s> so i went into the computer itself and looked same error </s>
<s> so when i restarted it wanted to run scan disk i think thats the dos disk utility at startup </s>
<s> so it ran over night and when i went to look at it in the morning the drive was empty </s>
<s> it had 200gb of data on it </s>
<s> this has happened to two other drives in the last few months </s>
<s> i can get computer details later to help figure out the problem </s>
<s> but i though some ideas might be on the top of someones head </s>
<s> i wonder if it s a power issue cable issue etc </s>
<s> i also have this computer in a quot closet quot with my cable modem wap and router </s>
<s> it s also in the same closet as the water meter i think that s what it s called where the water comes into the house </s>
<s> i wonder if it has some magnetic field that s effecting the pc </s>
<s> thanks jeff </s>
<s> 1 many of the hard disk testing utilities are data destructive </s>
<s> 2 are you using a damage resistant file system </s>
<s> if it s fat32 or such loss is not unheard of </s>
<s> 3 are you using a more reliable os like linux </s>
<s> 4 why couldn t you reveal enough information so the forum can take a guess at a proper sized power supply </s>
<s> 5 </s>
<s> 8 drives at about 20 watts each is 160 watts </s>
<s> since most power supplies fib about capacity i d fit something about 4 times that value plus beyond reason ventilation </s>
<s> 6 ide cables will be an issue in such an electrically noisy box </s>
<s> i would only accept 80 conductor ide cables if these are ide </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> since hard disks are temporary storage space you may want to review what the backup system is and how it failed </s>
<s> can you share why the backup system failed you </s>
<s> others can learn from this backup failure </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am using ntfs os is windows xp pro my power supply is an allied al a400atx 400watt all ide cables are pctoys 80wire ata133 cables </s>
<s> does that help </s>
<s> what kind of backup system can i used with almost 2 terabytes of data </s>
<s> i am in the process of backing up to dvd s </s>
<s> but that is gong to take forever </s>
<s> i am considering a nec 8x dvd drive for backups </s>
<s> but i hear the 8x are not as reliable as 2x and 4x </s>
<s> but i will probably use it anyway </s>
<s> but from your writing you may just be revealing that you have no concerns about data retention </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> along with what i read about your backup plan none </s>
<s> it appears you have work to do </s>
<s> best of luck bob </s>
<s> no i do </s>
<s> i just had this happen before i can get the data backed up to dvd s </s>
<s> it will take a while with that much data to get it all on dvd s </s>
<s> your choice on the backup scheme but dvd seems like a poor choice since you may need some 40 or 50 disks to hold 2 tb </s>
<s> time to look at dlt </s>
