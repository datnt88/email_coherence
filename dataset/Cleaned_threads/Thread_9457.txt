<s> i m a teacher and need to be able to use a keyboard while presenting information on the projector </s>
<s> sitting at a desk is stupid and impractical for me i ve got middle schoolers folks </s>
<s> and i was wondering what the effective range for wireless keyboards are </s>
<s> more than likely i would go for a usb but if a bluetooth has better range which common sense is telling it would i could go that route </s>
<s> thank you for any and all input </s>
<s> regards darren aho </s>
<s> i need a minimum of 30 feet of range but the more the better </s>
<s> 30ft is about the maximum range usually stated by rf wireless keyboards my own logitech can easily beat 20ft and through walls </s>
<s> mice rf range is far less mine begins to get lost in the maze at about 8ft though </s>
<s> the main problem here is that bluetooth range isn t any better with an effective range of wait for it 32ft which maybe means a careful and extended central position for the receiver would be required for either oh the logicalness of it all </s>
<s> so you could walk around it without going near either of the effective limits </s>
<s> geebee </s>
<s> that s good news </s>
<s> thank you </s>
