<s> hi i am looking to replace my old netgear rangemax wireless router wpn 824v2 with one that meets the following criteria 1 good range my router will be in the basement and my gaming computer is 2 floors up from here </s>
<s> 2 much better speed 300 would be good </s>
<s> i have been looking at the netgear wndr3700 is there a better one out there </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> since all the advice is to not put wifi routers in the basement you decided to do that in spite of all advice </s>
<s> i don t think any router will deliver in this scenario </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> was received </s>
<s> you ask new questions so let s tackle those head on </s>
<s> quot what do people do who work in large office buildings or apartment buildings regarding wireless routers </s>
<s> most likely they cannort have a router on each floor </s>
<s> if i cannot relocate from the basement where it is now what would you recommend </s>
<s> maybe a bridge using 2 routers or what </s>
<s> quot a bridge might have wifi on the other end </s>
<s> i ve noted ac powerline bridges that have wifi at one end which is a really nice and easy to setup solution </s>
<s> and you could use 2 routers with some bridge but some folk are challenged by the configuration which is noted in this forum s sticky post about post 18 or 19 </s>
<s> the wndr3700 is a great choice but when we don t follow the maker s recommendations we often are disappointed </s>
<s> example at post 3 notes more </s>
<s> you can try just one wndr3700 in the basement and have a backup plan if you are disappointed </s>
