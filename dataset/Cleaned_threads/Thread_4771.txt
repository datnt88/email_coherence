<s> if i have a 600 watt power supply and i my computer is using 450 600 is my computer really consuming 450 watts of electricity </s>
<s> if it does what kind of energy bill am i looking at </s>
<s> take the the watts your computer is using then divide that number by 1000 this will give you kw kilowatts </s>
<s> multiply the kw by your current electrical charge </s>
<s> this should be on your electric bill and is read in cents per kwh kilowatt hour </s>
<s> that will give you the cost per hour of running your computer </s>
<s> example of your computer running at 450 watts 450 watts 1000 45 45 x 065 charge per kwh 03 per hour of use </s>
<s> the efficiency of the power supply </s>
<s> these switching types are rather efficient compared to the old series regulators </s>
<s> they will run from 60 to 70 percent efficiency </s>
<s> it varies with with percentage of the design output load is actually being drawn </s>
<s> let s use 65 for a calculation </s>
<s> let s assume that the computer components are actually consuming 400 watts </s>
<s> thus at 65 eficiency the input power being consumed by the power supply is 400 divided by 0 65 just over 615 watts </s>
<s> now the cheapie supplies have no power factor correction so you get to cheat the power supply </s>
<s> they pump the volt amps you only pay for the watts </s>
<s> with a 0 8 power factor you may only pay for 616 watts but they generate 768 volt amps </s>
<s> believe it or not during the part of the cycle where the voltage is positive and the current is negative you are pumping power back to them </s>
<s> that s why the power companies love it when you buy a power supply with power factor correction and get the pf over 0 9 just so that you know giving you an exact answer is not simple </s>
