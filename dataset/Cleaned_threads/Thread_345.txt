<s> running 3dmark06 professional version i got a score of 10034 now with my system specs i feel that is low </s>
<s> does anyone have any advice </s>

<s> or is that normal </s>
<s> i have updated all of the drivers so i m pretty sure that isn t the problem </s>
<s> i have also ran a test on 3dmark vantage and got a score of about 6300 thank you for your time </s>
<s> seems fine i don t see why you think it should be higher though most people do seem to be a little supirsed by how low their score seems to them </s>
<s> you should look more at how its assigns the score </s>
<s> consider that it took a system with a a quad core overclocked to 6 5ghz to get a score above 45 000 </s>
<s> 3dmark is quite gpu intensive upgrade the video card </s>
