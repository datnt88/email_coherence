<s> i am researching equipment to set up my home network so that i can stream hd video and play ps3 games unline without lag </s>
<s> does anyone have any recommendations on wireless routers </s>
<s> i want to get the best of the best </s>
<s> so far i am looking at buffalo airstation ac1300 n900 gigabit dual band wzr d1800h </s>
<s> also i have been reading up on the usb 2 0 to 3 0 change </s>
<s> is this transition worth it </s>
<s> for storage i use two western digital 1 terabyte external hardrives </s>
<s> with setting up this new network im also trying to see what other external hardrives might be better in terms up uploading speed to support streaming </s>
<s> basically i am looking to redo my entire network which consist of two wd external hardrive terabytes 2 0 usb and a linksys wireless n router from 2006 any recommendations would be great </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i ve yet to see anything short of being at google hq to be without lag </s>
<s> it s more of a matter of your location and internet connection lag speed is nice but lag is not directly related to speed </s>
<s> but about your usb 3 0 question </s>
<s> usb 3 0 is nice when it works but if you ve followed the screams you know to not count on that </s>
<s> here we use usb 2 0 since for the usual work it s fine </s>
<s> and more than fast enough to play hd content </s>
<s> gt i read you are setting up a nas so be sure you don t over invest in nas boxes </s>
<s> all the reviews you read seem to dis such on speed </s>
<s> here we dedicated a netbook as a server and it handily bests most nas boxes and routers </s>

<s> location and internet connection even when dealing with internal network streaming </s>
<s> i should probably note that this is an area in which i am still learning so could you elaborate on this because would have assumed that location and speed should only affect dowloading content </s>
<s> i see your point on the 2 0 to 3 0 transition </s>
<s> from what i have read so far you need 3 0 to 3 0 to work correctly in addition to a 3 0 usb cord to connect the two </s>
<s> i would think that therotically this should help as my network is setup with two external hardrives connecting into my computer </s>
<s> my fix to this would be getting a 2 terabyte 3 0 external hardrive and connecting it with a 3 0 cord into a 3 0 slot on my desktop </s>
<s> i bring all this up as i have a ton of movies in which i hope to stream to my tv via ps3 or western digital live tv box </s>
<s> however with my corrent set up it lags throughout the movie </s>
<s> this is expected as much of my equipment is outdated and needs updated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> location still matters for streaming as what if your isp has a small pipe to get all it s subscribers access to netflix </s>
<s> but it sounds as if speed is the issue an not lag </s>
<s> lag in video games upsets the player as they click the button and the delay means they may not get the shot </s>
<s> speed helps when streaming as it keeps the video player s buffer full </s>
<s> however if you have a member running some torrent then we have to wait for you to realize what cures that one </s>
<s> there s also better streamers and apps </s>
<s> i m beginning to see the makers quot get a clue quot today as my kindle fire hd can download a movie in advance of the time i want to play it </s>
<s> this means i am not as subject to speed issues as its buffer is huge </s>
<s> let s hope more streaming players are increasing those buffers </s>
