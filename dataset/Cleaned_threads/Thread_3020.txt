<s> i have a wired home network between 2 desktops using netgear router </s>
<s> replaced the client desktop with new </s>
<s> now i continue to get this quot unplugged quot message and have done absolutely everything i can think of to make this work </s>
<s> i have no internet on new computer while the host computer is fine </s>
<s> yes i have checked the connections and everything is hooked up properly </s>
<s> the connection wizard does not help </s>
<s> 1 switching the working pc to the non working port with the non working cable </s>
<s> 2 try another port on the router for the non working pc </s>
<s> i switched cables and still have a quot network cable unplugged quot message </s>
<s> the port connected to new computer does work when connected to the original computer so the port does not seem to be the problem </s>
<s> this connection has worked perfectly with my old dell </s>
<s> i only replaced towers no cables or other items </s>
<s> i just can t find a cure </s>
<s> by cycling the power off and on </s>
<s> this may update a stuck dhcp client list </s>
<s> if the network works fine in spite of the notification read to turn it off </s>
<s> i ve fixed it dozens of times myself and it s always been the motherboard and lan drivers </s>
<s> remember that if you ever accepted a microsoft windows update driver then i think your only exit is a total os install or the above off setting </s>
