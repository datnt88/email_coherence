<s> my kitten knocked over my external hdd and now it is clicking </s>
<s> my computer will not recognize it </s>
<s> is there anyway i can recover the data </s>
<s> if anyone has had a similar problem how much did it cost you to recover your data </s>
<s> but clickers almost always run about 600 bucks at can i ask why there is no backup </s>
<s> recovery costs so much that backup looks cheap </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this was my back up drive </s>
<s> i have almost all my files on the 2 other drives i have </s>
<s> i think i may have lost 3 4 folders </s>
<s> these folders however had movies tv shows and pictures </s>
<s> whew </s>
<s> sorry you have the quot click of death quot which usually means no real work around </s>
<s> its a h w fault that will fail entirely </s>
<s> since you mention you have some other backup then consider the ext </s>
<s> hd a lost </s>
<s> you can if possible buy another similar hd itself replace the old with new of the enclosure just buy the right type even a larger one if you like </s>
<s> all too often as stated here in the storage forum you won t recover much or all of it should you persist in doing so </s>
<s> if possible try the warranty path maybe the replacement cost will be low or even free except for minor costs </s>
<s> however the data is pretty much toast </s>
<s> the last gasp is to remove the ext </s>
<s> hd inside and mount in a desktop system and try to recover data </s>
<s> next time have the ext </s>
<s> hd somewhere not too exposed to kitty </s>
<s> my cats don t trouble mine as i use velcro strips to keep in place </s>
<s> idea </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
