<s> hi im having major problems with my router </s>
<s> we have a linksys wrt54gs with a desktop connected to it via cable and my laptop running on wireless </s>
<s> things were ok until a few weeks ago when my connection started dropping more often but it would immediately connect by itself a few seconds later </s>
<s> but now i cant even connect to the internet </s>
<s> heres the detail at first i couldnt even connect to the router although my laptop would pick up the signal </s>
<s> the router is set to have a network key wpa or wpa ii so i played around with the connection properties and changed the network authentication to open from shared and left data encryption to wep </s>
<s> now this time i can connect to the router access the routers setting and access the other computer but cant browse the net </s>
<s> just for ease ive disabled the routers security mode now </s>
<s> im running windows xp security update 2 and i have a intel wireless network card 802 11 b g </s>
<s> did i mention how annoying this is </s>
<s> i also had another linksys the wrt54g and that thing died on me too a while ago </s>
<s> and yes i have the latest firmware </s>
<s> thanks everyone </s>
<s> does this happen with both computers </s>
<s> does this happen only with wireless on the notebook </s>
<s> scan for viruses and spyware </s>
<s> if only a wireless problem try a different broadcast channel 1 6 or 11 </s>
<s> results </s>
<s> the problem was only with the laptop </s>
<s> the pc worked fine it was just the laptop that couldn t suft despite being connected to the router </s>
<s> for some reason i was playing around with the connection settings and even though i didn t change anything at the end when i disconnected the router and the modem for 30 seconds i had done this before at least a bizzillion times it started working again </s>
<s> i m guessing there was a problem with my ip </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i have problems trying to connect to a shared printer and i can identify with your problem some solution if can get on the internet go site </s>
<s> from there you will be able to have the router through this site just follow the directions </s>
<s> or call the linksys tech support at 1 800 326 7114 </s>
<s> i have the same router same setup 2 pc s hard wired wireless laptop and had the same problem </s>
<s> im new to wireless and had just bought a laptop and router </s>
<s> worked fine for a few weeks then started dropping out more and more </s>
<s> called linksys and went step by step thru configuration and it has been ok since if i remember it had to do with the channel it was on </s>
<s> call them and set it up right </s>
<s> should be fine still cant share the damn printer though lol good luck </s>
<s> i feel your pain </s>
<s> i still can t get any connection to my printer either </s>
<s> calling linksys about this annoying problem was a waste of time and effort </s>
<s> i have a dell demension 3000 and a linksys wrt54gs </s>
<s> if you have a shared printer on a computer did you tell the personal firewall on that computer to allow other computers to access it </s>
<s> maybe set up a quot trusted quot range of ip addresses in that firewall </s>
<s> or is it a network printer that connects directly to the router or via a print server </s>
<s> the printer is connected to the computer </s>
<s> if you are not aware of it netstumbler is a great free site survey tool </s>
<s> it will tell you how stong the signal is and it will tell you all of the other networks within range of your wireless card </s>
<s> it tells you the channel they are using and whether they are encrypted or not </s>
<s> if you are lucky you will only see devices on channel 1 6 or 11 anybody using channels other than this are rookies and need some education on wireless </s>
<s> this is a more scientific approach to choosing a random channel </s>
