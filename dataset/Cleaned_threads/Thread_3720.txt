<s> hello and thanks in advance for your time </s>
<s> i m running a dell latitude e6500 and ever since i pulled it out of the box a few days ago the disk drive will not recognize new disks </s>
<s> if an audio cd is in the drive and i switch it to a data cd it will not change the icon or name of the disk in the drive </s>
<s> for example if cd a is in the drive on boot and ten minutes later i replace it with cd b when i open computer i still see the information for cd a instead of the information for cd b when i hit quot explore quot however i see cd b s data </s>
<s> even after i have done this cd a s information remains displayed </s>
<s> i run windows vista ultimate and the drive is an quot hl dt st dvd rw gsa u20n quot </s>
<s> i already checked for driver updates loose contacts and autoplay issues </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated and as you can see this is my first post on these forums so if i left out any necessary information let me know and i should get back to the thread within a short time </s>
<s> i would reseat the connections at both ends several times </s>
<s> verify that any addressing jumper is present or is proper </s>
<s> why did you pull the drive in the 1st place to access something or replace it etc </s>
<s> did you use proper quot static quot handling </s>
<s> if not then you now have the result from improper handling </s>
<s> if this is sata type connection these can be awful when reconnecting as it is possible to break or spread the contacts from touching 100 </s>
<s> verify all this and come back with results </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> the latitude is a laptop it shipped with this issue so static is out </s>
<s> but yes i own an antistatic mat and wrist strap and utilize both when working with internal components i ve been called paranoid </s>
<s> and i did not remove the drive quot in the first place quot i did it in response to this problem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i pulled and reseated the drive in order to potentially solve this problem which arose before i did so </s>
<s> that s better </s>
<s> if this is a new laptop use the warranty </s>
<s> however you may have voided the warranty depends </s>
<s> if this is used and can return it as it wasn t stated having that problem if possible </s>
<s> because this is a laptop a repair from a proper shop maybe the only cure </s>
<s> other than a hd swap could you begin suspect something else </s>
<s> your options become very limited as user repair </s>
<s> i have laptop adapter kit to see if the hd works elsewhere </s>
<s> you can use usb ext </s>
<s> case as well to check out hd </s>
