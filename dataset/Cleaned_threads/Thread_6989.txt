<s> hi my system was working perfectly sound worked great </s>
<s> then i was going thru the menu s in musicmatchjb and i tried to go into player setup and mmjb crashed </s>
<s> then when i restarted it i found that it would not play </s>
<s> it gave a message like mmjb failure soundcard problem or something like that </s>
<s> i looked in device manager and it said my sb was working but still i had no sound </s>
<s> so i deleted the sb from the device manager and proceeded to restart so the card would be recognized again </s>
<s> a card was recoginzed but it said quot pci multimedia device quot no sblive then it asked for a driver which i couldn t find but would not accept any driver on the creative sblive install disk </s>
<s> next i removed everything from the computer that i thought had to do with the sb </s>
<s> first i did add remove programs and removed sblive and all software </s>
<s> i removed the wave device that was added to device manager </s>
<s> no sound card was listed </s>
<s> i went thru and manually removed everything in the registry that had the words creative or cddb or anything else i thought might be related </s>
<s> now i try to restart again </s>
<s> same thing </s>
<s> i can t install this card yet i know it works </s>
<s> when i got close at one point to getting it to at least install something i would get a quot ctstub quot error </s>
<s> i really need help </s>
<s> i use the pc mainly for music anymore and without sound this thing is a boat anchor </s>
<s> the manual says that when the dialog comes up for selecting a driver location to cancel and insert the install disk and go thru the process </s>
<s> sometimes that goes thru but while still in that program the found new device pci multimedia device comes up again </s>
<s> i click cancel and the install finishes but no sound card is ever installed </s>
<s> please help i have win98 installed if that helps </s>
<s> i know i have been long winded but i wanted to give as much info as i could so someone out there can understand the problem and hopefully help </s>

<s> did you try re seating the card in its slot </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> the card is firmly seated in the socket </s>
<s> this seems like a windows system driver problem to me </s>
<s> i removed the software and device from device manager and reinstalled windows </s>
<s> windows did not correctly pick up the card when reinstalled </s>
<s> then with the new windows installation i removed all sb software and devices again </s>
<s> then rebooted </s>
<s> this time it did recognize the card </s>
<s> it recognized two things actually </s>
<s> 1 sblive 5 1 wave sound device and 2 pci multimedia audio device </s>
<s> the only one it asked for the driver for was the pci and i said cancel </s>
<s> then i used the sb disk to run it s installation </s>
<s> seemed to go well but when finished and restarted i got the new hw found pci mult audio device again </s>
<s> i clicked cancel again </s>
<s> then went to device manager </s>
<s> the soundblaster card was not listed </s>
<s> what else can be done to get this card to install </s>
<s> where else can i get help </s>
