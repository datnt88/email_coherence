<s> hello i want to build a nice gaming computer and i have slightly over a grand to spend on parts not including monitor and operating system those are covered already </s>
<s> i have some general computer knowledge what parts handle what and i have a pretty good idea of where to plug them in </s>
<s> that being said when buying parts i m at a bit of a loss </s>
<s> i m not sure when looking at a motherboard for instance what i need to be looking for </s>
<s> i think i might could find some high performance parts but i m really worried about them being compatible if anyone has ideas on some good compatible parts or possibly tips as to what i could run into as far is incompatibility issues that would be great </s>
<s> thanks nicholas </s>

<s> if you don t get a combination that s been tested you re rolling the dice </s>
<s> they re supposed to all work together but we know how murphy loves computers </s>
