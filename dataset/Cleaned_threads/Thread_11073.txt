<s> has anybody bought this thing i cant seem to find any reveiws on it on the net </s>
<s> its a westinghouse 17 quot widescreen flat panel tft lcd monitor thanx a lot </s>
<s> best buy has to offer something is certain price ranges otherwise people buyers won t come in </s>
<s> westinghouse is a good brand name but it never was a recent electronics power house </s>
<s> its just another import offered branded by westinghouse so take care and read the specs </s>
<s> if possible take one in hand and look at the model label sticker you may find who really makes it and thus take that to the google search </s>
<s> sorry for now price is the best virtue of the lcd </s>
<s> everyone wants a cheap lcd but if you really intend to keep it for awhile cheap is not the way to go and pay for decent brandname out there </s>
<s> if not best buy some vendor always has a sale on some lcd </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> try newegg com frys geeks com and such and you ll find those as well </s>
<s> for the price not bad </s>

<s> thanx for the help guys but i think widescreen would give mor picture for a widescreen type dvd movie </s>
<s> isnt that so correct me if i am wrong </s>
<s> all i can say is i couldn t have bought a better one for the price i play a lot online especially bf2 and this lcd is hands down one of the best i ve used if you have the dvi d cable it looks awesome i recommend it 150 sorry if you got the answer already </s>
<s> it s an outstanding monitor </s>
<s> i have 2 of them </s>
<s> you will be very happy </s>
<s> use the 1280x768 setting </s>
<s> if you are making the jump from crt 800x600 it will take a little getting used to but well worth it </s>
<s> in 30 days someone will need a gun to take it away from you </s>
<s> nice looking white monitor with a sharp bright colorful picture </s>
<s> if you ve never run a widescreen you re in for a real treat </s>
