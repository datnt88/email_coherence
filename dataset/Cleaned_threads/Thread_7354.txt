<s> i have no idea what to think of this i have cable internet and a wireless network and recently it s been acting up </s>
<s> when i go to a webpage i get a delay of several seconds before anything even begins to load and it s slow at best after that </s>
<s> but if i go to download a file downloads are quick and without interruption 500kb sec on a fast server </s>
<s> this is entirely confusing to me </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> i m running a powerbookg4 1 67ghz with 1gb ram which has given me no trouble </s>
<s> it also happens on two other windows xp desktops in the house </s>
<s> could it have something to do with my wireless signal strength </s>
<s> i normally have decent strength 3 out of 4 bars but when i get closer to the router it might go a little quicker or it might just be in my head </s>
<s> bandwidth test at cnet is the same despite location </s>
<s> wireless router is the netgear wgr614v5 with the latest firmware </s>
<s> i m stumped </s>
<s> read and that dns poison issue is not limited to that product </s>
<s> various isps are now updating dns servers to mitigate this issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i notice that if i use firefox web browser web pages download much faster than on ie </s>
<s> try firefox on the pc s and see if that makes a difference it s free </s>
