<s> hi i m in the market for a hd enclosure </s>
<s> i plan on buying the new 1 terabyte hd by hitachi when it comes out this month </s>
<s> but when i look for enclosures a lot of them say that their maximum hd capacity is 500 gb or 750 gb etc </s>
<s> since all 3 5 quot hd s are the same size physically why is there a capacity for an enclosure </s>
<s> shouldn t it not matter </s>
<s> would a 1 tb hd work in an enclosure that says their max is 500 gb </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> there are no 1tb drives to test in said enclosures so while it should work no one has tested it hence this is why you read this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ve purchased several adaptec external hdd enclosures and they have served me well </s>
<s> they were the only mfg at the time that offered enclosures which clearly stated their enclosures handled hdds greater than 300gbs </s>
<s> having used their scsi hbas i knew i could depend on their products specs </s>
<s> it appears adaptec is discontinuing this line of products from their sales </s>
