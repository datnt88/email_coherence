<s> thanks </s>

<s> bob </s>
<s> i originally purchased the nexus 7 and loved every thing about it </s>
<s> my wife loved it so much well she took it from me </s>
<s> i then purchased the me301 in place of another nexus and prefer the me301 for a few reasons </s>
<s> the number 1 reason was it s memory expansion capabilities the second reason was the rear camera </s>
<s> crazy as it sounds you don t expect to take pictures with a tablet but it s a good feature to have when the need arises </s>
<s> i will admit i like the comfort of the nexus 7 better however the new me301 is pretty comfortable for it s size </s>
<s> last comment i use the device for personal and business </s>
<s> the me301 is a better choice when sharing information with friends and or customers </s>
<s> oh wait one more note both these purchases were my first i mean second asus purchase and i am really impressed with the power and capabilities they packed in a low cost device s </s>
<s> hope this helps you make a decision </s>
<s> if you re going that far why not find a t 300 </s>
