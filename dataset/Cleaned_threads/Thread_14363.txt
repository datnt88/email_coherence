<s> i wanted to reformat my western digital 250 gb hard drive </s>
<s> it says the file system is a fat32 right now </s>
<s> but when im about to reformat it it only gives me the option to format it in ntfs </s>
<s> so will it my hard drive break or somthing if i reformat it in ntfs </s>
<s> cause i wanna know how to just reformat it in fat32 </s>
<s> if you re running xp the drive should be formatted in ntfs </s>
<s> ok so i have a windows xp pro so i just format it in ntfs and it ll still work </s>
<s> make sure you have any files you wanted to keep backed up because if you format the drive anything on it will be lost </s>
<s> xp all versions use the nt file system ntfs </s>
<s> it s much more stable than the old dos based fat32 </s>
