<s> i have a hp laserjet 1100a that used to be connected through a standard parallel port and of which both printing and scanning functions worked properly </s>
<s> last year i had to purchase a new computer windows xp pro included </s>
<s> since it has no parallel ports and installing a parallel port pci card did not work i connected the printer through a parallel to usb cable adapter </s>
<s> the printer works perfectly as a standard printer </s>
<s> however when i install the scanning software from the cd i am prompted for a physical parallel lptx port which of course makes no sense for my environment </s>
<s> and while windows xp detects the scanner as a quot parallel quot peripheral i have no driver to configure it and make it operational </s>
<s> so my question is is there an existing driver that supports such a parallel to usb connection for the scanner module </s>
<s> if so where can i get it </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any helpful information jeff </s>
<s> this is why older devices get abandoned due to old age and connectivity to include s w issues </s>
<s> i don t see why the lpt pci parallel port card didn t work it should have </s>
<s> however answer lpt1 for the parallel port question or check in quot device manager quot what lptx get listed </s>
<s> you also lack details of your system maybe there is a lpt port available and or some bios setting to be done </s>
<s> otherwise you ve gone as far as the legacy device allows with its dated drivers and s w </s>
<s> the real fix is to replace that device with supported usb connect </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> quot installing a parallel port pci card did not work quot they work for me on xp just fine </s>
<s> but many don t know to dive into the cards settings to change the address to the old lp1 standard addresses and claim it fails </s>
<s> this knowledge is fading so research what those addresses are </s>
<s> it s partly because i want you to fish for the answers since it will help you understand the problem in depth </s>
<s> here s the card i used last time gt quot configurable for standard isa parallel port addresses 0278 and 0378 for compatibility quot that s the ticket </s>
