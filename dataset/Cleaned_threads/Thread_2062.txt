<s> my question is about how to get my os to boot properly </s>
<s> i have a maxtor 60gb sata that my os is installed on and i have a 160 gb western digital ide hdd </s>
<s> after installing the second drive i started getting an error when i start my computer that says quot disk boot failure insert system disk and press enter quot </s>
<s> i can instert a system disk and press enter and get the same error however if i insert a system disk and reset my comp then wait for the quot press any key to boot from cd quot message to pass my computer will boot just fine only if i have the windows install disk in the drive </s>
<s> to top all of this off i m getting an automatic check disk on drive c not the drive my os is on just before my computer finnishes loading windows </s>
<s> the message tells me that there are quot inconsistancies quot on drive c if i cancel this check disk it continues just fine with no errors but if i let the check disk commence it takes almost a full hour to check drive c and then i get system hang when it finally logs into windows </s>
<s> my specs are listed below thanks in advance for any help </s>

<s> this is the first time i have used sata i am clueless as to how to properly set a sata disk as the o s </s>
<s> disk and no i did not get a cd of apps and drivers with my sata drive it was from tigerdirect and was a refurbished drive </s>
<s> your issue is simply that microsoft s xp sp2 does not install of sata without a lot of help from the person that installs this os </s>
<s> i don t tell how to install xp since there are thousands of web sites about that so let s go quickly over the basics </s>
<s> we boot the xp sp2 cd and have the sata drivers handy on diskette </s>
<s> at some point we tap one of the f keys to tell xp s installer we will supply drivers that microsoft doesn t put on their cd </s>
<s> after all that we have a working install but with out of date drivers and possibly no sound internet or such </s>
<s> we get to install a potload of drivers </s>
<s> if this is an add on drive and not a boot drive then you need to check your boot order in the bios </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok well first off this is a boot drive and i have been in the bios so many times i damn neer have every setting memorized by now </s>
<s> as for installing drivers i ve already got windows and a butload of other programs installed so is there a way to install the necessary drivers without re installing windows </s>
<s> my biggest problem with installing drivers during windows install is that of my 4 computers i don t have one single opperational floppy drive much less any disks to put the files on </s>
<s> thanks for the info bob </s>
<s> if you can burn a cd there are instructions for slipstreaming the driver into your copy of xp </s>
<s> google xp slipstream sata driver or google xp unattended install sata driver alternatives borrow a floppy drive just for the installation cannabalize old computer for a floppy drive buy an internal floppy drive usd 6 sh buy a nice external usb 2 0 floppy drive very handy my preference beg borrow or buy a floppy drive </s>
<s> windows xp is already installed then you don t need a floppy drive </s>
<s> just download the proper driver check for a non floppy versoin and install it </s>
<s> that some systems force us to supply the sata drivers on diskette </s>
<s> next year microsoft promises to fix that but only in vista </s>
<s> as to the issue of moving the os or such that s another lacking area </s>
<s> you can attempt a repair install and follow the usual steps needed to make the os install proper </s>
<s> microsoft has shown no mercy in that quot keep my old programs quot issue </s>
<s> there appears to be no plans for that in vista as well </s>
<s> i think it s an antipiracy ploy </s>
