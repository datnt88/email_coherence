<s> the problem obviously lies in the use of the second wireless router </s>
<s> therefore why not install a wi fi card in the desktop bridge the wi fi and ethernet connections to do away with the second router </s>
<s> then enable internet connection sharing on the desktop and create a vpn </s>
<s> darton thank you for the reply </s>
<s> i suppose as a last resort i may do that but if there s any way to get it working with my current setup i d like to </s>
<s> i feel like i m so darn close like i m missing just one little step </s>
<s> brian </s>
<s> try turning off dhcp server in the netgear and let the westell assign addresses to the computers for you </s>
<s> the wireless will still work as long as it is enabled </s>
<s> it will just get it s ip from the westell </s>
<s> as long as you have port fowarding and pptp configured correctly this should work </s>
