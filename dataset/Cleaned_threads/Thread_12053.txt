<s> i really dont know much about computers i would definitely build my own gaming rig if i did </s>
<s> if i had tons to spend i would go with something a site like falconnw or something but im looking to spend around 850 </s>
<s> im looking at cyberpower im thinking an amd phenomii x4 cpu with a radeon 5760 gpu </s>
<s> 1 is this pretty good for gaming </s>
<s> if so how long will it be sufficient for running most games </s>
<s> 2 what should i know about matching the mobo with the cpu if the mb says amd is that all i really need to worry about </s>
<s> 3 case size i dont ever think i will need to run a setup with more than one gpu i dont play high end fps titles </s>
<s> can i just go with the default case </s>
<s> 4 what is an internal usb extension module </s>
<s> what is a motherboard expansion card </s>
<s> do i need these </s>
<s> any help would really be appreciated im in over my head a little </s>
<s> also i found a few extremely negative reviews about cyberpower </s>
<s> lots of positive ones but the negative ones are scaring me a bit a couple said they dont test the systems before shipping </s>
<s> does anyone have suggestions as far as comparably priced vendors </s>
<s> ibuypower perhaps </s>
<s> cyperpower is nothing more than a 3rd party building systems with typical off shelf components and putting them in a glitzy case </s>
<s> you can do all that just as well </s>
<s> what many consumers complain about is generally they ordering a top end pc and putting through its paces on gamers demands </s>
<s> these users are generally the most demanding punishing out there </s>
<s> make no bones about it they want the best for the least yet don t really put the effort to really get things going smoothly </s>
<s> you can t oc and expect things to always be good </s>
<s> you can t push the pc to the extremes and expect good results </s>
<s> you can t allow the pc to cook in heat bath for long </s>
<s> you really can t play for hrs </s>
<s> on high output and then expect to run every day like that </s>
<s> you can only if the is spend wisely installed components and everyday tlc </s>
<s> usage of only the best components and pay attention to the small details </s>
<s> cooling and more cooling and make it work </s>
<s> follow the hints tips clues of any hic up via some gamers forum drivers forum s w forum and or basic google hits </s>
<s> of course if cyperpower ships a piece of crap well that speaks for itself </s>
<s> check your wishlist against all those gaemr pc systems and see what makes them tick </s>
<s> or look into high end pcs and just what they offer and see if you can build one </s>
<s> i generally advise now is to get a big case big and namebrand psu and any cooling options </s>
<s> then build on that because those 3 items i mentioned are not overlooked or taken for granted and or shortsighted with regard to the classy items a pc will need </s>
<s> that s all tada willy </s>
<s> unless you are very rich there is no such thing as a off the shelf gaming computer </s>
<s> the majority of gamers build their own </s>
<s> that way you can assemble a computer without spending mega bucks </s>
<s> as you claim you are not too computer literate start by googling the web for the fastest cpu the best video cards and the best motherboard </s>
<s> make a note on the specifications and price of each component </s>
<s> this would give you an idea of the cost </s>
<s> don t get caught up with the speed hype </s>
<s> a good dual processor will blow the doors off of a quad or even a six cpu </s>
<s> remember that intel is better than amd </s>
<s> you also would want to get the best power supply and ram you can afford along with a good mid size case </s>
<s> goto all the forums and glean them for information </s>
<s> this way you will be able to get a good computer without buying a ready made one </s>
<s> my saying on this is get a pc at bestbuy walmart etc get a computer by building it yourself </s>
<s> with modern computer parts it is quite easy to assemble your own </s>
<s> gone are the days where you had to jumper motherboards and needed an engineering degree to set one up </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> thanks guys i appreciate the feedback </s>
<s> at this point i think i am actually going to attempt to build it myself </s>
<s> i have been watching build your own pc vids on youtube like crazy and i really think i can do it </s>
<s> i have learned more about computers in the last four days than i have in my entire existence on this planet </s>
<s> im really excited thanks alot guys </s>
