<s> i just got my new xion solaris case from newegg com it has 2 front audio and 2 front usb ports </s>
<s> using both the motherboard and case manuals i connected the cables for the usb to my motherboard and doublechecked that the pins were correct but the ports are not working </s>
<s> i did not connect the audio ports and left the pins jumped </s>
<s> i am running win xp sp2 this is my first case with front usb </s>
<s> if there are other usb ports are they active </s>
<s> if not or only the frt </s>
<s> usb ports make sure under the bios section they are enabled </s>
<s> of course recheck the wiring it can be confusing at times for anyone </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i ve had my psu 350w for a while and done some upgrades to my pc since having it </s>
<s> i wonder if there isn t enough power to run the front ports </s>
<s> could anyone tell me how to test my psu </s>
<s> the wiring and bios area </s>
<s> there is no real test other than a voltmeter and that only does voltages </s>
<s> if everything else works you should have enough for the usb </s>
<s> usb doesn t need that much to run </s>
<s> since this is a new build you have to recheck before you start elsewhere </s>
<s> don t take things for granted </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
