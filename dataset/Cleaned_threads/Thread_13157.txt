<s> i just moved to the uk from the us and i am trying to get my desktop up and running </s>
<s> dell customer service is useless </s>
<s> is there a company that sells a kit to do this uk cords power conversion items etc </s>
<s> any advice is appreciated </s>
<s> my friends simply use step down transformers for the devices that don t run on 240 the items that are rated for that higher voltage just need a new cord or plug adapter </s>
<s> dell has little to nothing to do with this </s>
<s> your expectations are dashed here </s>

<s> i tried to plug everything into a us power strip then i plugged the strip cord into a radio shack converter </s>
<s> i ended up hearing a buzzing sound through the computer speakers and then heard a quot pop quot sound before the circuit blew on the wall outlet </s>
<s> do you think i damaged the computer </s>
<s> i fear i may need a new power supply for the computer but how can i tell </s>
<s> also any recommendataions on where to get power cords step down converters for the desktop in the uk </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> you need to see what runs on 240 and what does not </s>
<s> the radio shack convertor has to be of sufficient size to handle what you plug into it </s>
<s> what parts run directly on 240 or thereabouts should not be on the convertor </s>
<s> the radio shack people should be chatty about this so take advantage and talk about it there since this medium is not as chatty </s>
