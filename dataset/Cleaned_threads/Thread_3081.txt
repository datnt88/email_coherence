<s> i am using 2 nic cards and a direct connection with no router or hub </s>
<s> both computers have modems </s>
<s> the problem is when the device driver quot ndis vxd quot tries to load the driver for ics icshare vxd the device refuses to load </s>
<s> this information comes from the bootlog </s>
<s> i also have the horrible little yellow exclamation point in the device manager computer network adapters internet connection sharing </s>
<s> i can load a new driver for the ics adapter in quot device manager quot all day long also tried icshare inf fix from microsoft but the yellow exclamation point never dies </s>
<s> and the device still refuses to load </s>
<s> i am 90 sure that nothing is wrong with ndis vxd but i am at a loss as how to force something to load or update the ics setup completely </s>
<s> yes i ve tried to uninstall and reinstall using add remove programs </s>
<s> several times with the client disconnected from the host and connected </s>
<s> i have spent 2 days trying to get this darn network up and running </s>
<s> i m soooo tired now </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> randi </s>
<s> operating system but windows 98 comes to mind and as such i would look for updated drivers for your nic along with any updates to that os </s>
<s> next i would sweep the machine with the usual bug removal tools and finally try another network card </s>
<s> yep it s win98se </s>
<s> just bought the nic and the drivers are the latest from the web and disk </s>
<s> updates for os are getting harder to come by but i have installed all available updates had to really search for some of them that may even remotely apply to this problem </s>
<s> last night ran full scan defrag sfc virus check reg check couple different ad aware type programs etc and this was all before i knew i have a problem with the device refusing to load </s>
<s> had a system crash a week ago computer wouldn t do anything but almost everything is restored to previous operating environment windows troubleshooter still will not function </s>
<s> as a result of fix i now have a second computer also win98se and came up with clever idea to establish a network </s>
<s> clever my </s>
<s> i m determined now to complete this task </s>
<s> keep the ideas coming </s>
<s> randi </s>
<s> try removing the nic in device manager right click and then remove and then shutdown immediately </s>
<s> open the case and swap the nic to a different pci slot and be sure it is fully seated in the slot </s>
<s> reboot the o s will detect the new hardware go through the driver disk dance and see if that helps </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> ok i know this is gonna sound incredibly stupid but i just have to check are you using a crossover network cable between your 2 computers because the network will never run with a straight through straight through cords are almost always blue crossover is another colour </s>
<s> if your network cable is blue stop trying to get your network to work and go out and buy a cross over network cable then try and get it running if that aint the problem which i m guessing it aint then you going to need to perform a little trick with 98 driver installation when you try to install your drivers note down what file it s asking for just the name and it s extension now get a good ol floppy disk and stick it in your a drive then use search to find the driver file on your installation cd s and or windows on your hard drive now when it s found that file copy and paste it onto your floppy try to install the driver again and tell it to look on the floppy hey presto you ve got a driver installed this problem occurs because 98 s driver installation doesn t search deeply into sub folders to find the driver so by chucking it onto the floppy even the most stupid program can find the driver hope this solves your problem </s>
<s> swapped pci slots twice due to resource conflicts and in hoping that reinstall would fix issue resource conflicts are resolved but still can t fix ics adapter which adds into the device manager after installing software in add remove programs </s>
<s> had crossover cable made at computer store it s grey and all the connections are correct </s>
<s> cat5 ends are neat and solid and the cable has been tested </s>
<s> tried putting drivers in c drive but haven t tried floppy pointed install program to created file on c drive with no change in error will try pointing it to floppy next wish me luck sigh </s>
