<s> i have a sony micro vault usm8gl flash drive that is not recognized by any computer that i stick it into </s>
<s> the last time that i tried to access it it said that something about it being a security device and i popped it out </s>
<s> everysine then i have not been able to acess the data on the flash drive </s>
<s> it is a 8gb drie and nearly full </s>
<s> it has all of my most precious data on it icluding baby photo s the book i have been writing and tax information </s>
<s> i am thinking that somehow it was converted to a security device but i have searched high and low on how to change that as well with no luck whatsoever </s>
<s> i am quite desperate </s>
<s> i have not backed it up because of time </s>
<s> so please don t give me any smart remarks about being stupid for not backing it up i know that i was a fool for not backing it up </s>

<s> i may have lost a turn but you sound unreasonably peeved and anyway your post in the referenced top thread says quot this post is mostly for missing drive letters and not corrupt drives </s>
<s> for this to apply your usb stick or drive works fine in other machines </s>
<s> that is all machines but yours quot i had stated that i have already tried my unrecognised usb stick on one another machines with no luck </s>
<s> as regards quot a shame because we could be discussing if linux boot cds found it or not quot i tried the ubuntu bootable cd without luck either no sign of any usb devices there unless i should have looked in some mysterious location that i missed </s>
