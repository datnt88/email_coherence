<s> last week i bought a new pc compaq cq5700f os windows 7 </s>
<s> i am using it with my old monitor emachines e17t4w problem there is about a 2 inch strip of black from top to bottom on the right hand side </s>
<s> i ran through the monitor menu nothing fixed the problem though quot auto quot made the black space smaller by a couple of inches </s>
<s> i did a chat with a compaq tech who could not identify and fix the problem </s>
<s> emachines web site offered no help either </s>
<s> so i turn to you techies hoping someone might have an idea what is going on and have a possible solution </s>
<s> note monitor worked perfectly with old pc emachines it never had this problem </s>
<s> old pc has been taken to recyclers so there is no way to plug it back in and see if it would still work correctly with that pc </s>
<s> i see that a lot when the monitor driver is not installed i m unsure why but many need this setup at the shop </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i did consider it might be a driver issue but did not feel comfortable trolling the web looking for a needle in a haystack correct driver </s>
<s> i did check out the windows 7 compatibility center </s>
<s> they listed 2039 monitors tv s that are compatible with windows 7 they listed only 3 emachines monitors </s>
<s> my emachines monitor wasn t listed </s>
<s> i don t have the money to take it to a tech and have them fix the problem </s>
<s> so i think i will live with the black bar on my screen since it is not really a distraction </s>
<s> just thought i d try and fix it if i could </s>
<s> we have the two name brands and the model numbers but the driver would be the monitor driver </s>
<s> this is not so much a driver but a file called monitor inf that let s windows know what settings to show for that monitor </s>
<s> you can google monitor inf if you want to learn what these files do </s>
<s> as i noted i find many don t want to install these so a trip to a good shop is often the cure </s>
<s> then again you just bought the machine from who </s>
<s> maybe they ll fix this for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> found this driver updater on cnet site </s>
<s> it was just added 6 8 11 </s>
<s> i d like to think this would be a safe download that wouldn t cause my pc to get the wrong drivers and thus create problems only a pc tech could fix </s>
<s> do you have any opinions about this software </s>
<s> also to answer your inquiry about returning item to place purchased to have drivers updated that is not an option </s>
<s> i ordered the pc online from target and had it shipped to me </s>
<s> i m never had to use such </s>
<s> i d head to e4me com or whatever the emachines site is to find the monitor driver </s>
<s> i ve yet to see driver packs include monitor inf files </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the first place i checked for monitor drivers was at emachines website </s>
<s> for my monitor there are no driver updates available </s>
<s> i think since the monitor is four years old they don t bother to offer driver updates </s>
<s> thanks for the info about driver packs not including monitor inf files i did not know that </s>
<s> that notes the hide feature and you can try other settings there </s>
<s> however it s possible that since the monitor is pnp more praying </s>
<s> that you ll have fun trying video card drivers too </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> yes it was sold with the westinghouse label and maybe other names </s>
<s> so i went to the link you provided and read about how to find what graphic resolutions the graphic adapter supports </s>
<s> but because i have windows 7 i think directions were for vista it took me a little bit of time to find access to the list under control panel change display settings advanced settings </s>
<s> then i went to my monitor menu and under advanced went to information the monitor info reads quot 1280 x 720 60 hz quot </s>
<s> then i went back to supported graphics resolutions and switched it from where it was set quot 1280 x 720 true color 32 bit 59 hz quot to the same but at 60hz </s>
<s> instead of 59hz </s>
<s> clicked apply and now i have full use of the screen </s>
<s> one strange note </s>
<s> when i first changed the setting from 59hz to 60hz i encountered a wavy screen problem </s>
<s> so i went back into the supported resolutions list and tried a few of the other 1280 x 720 choices </s>
<s> those did not solve the problem </s>
<s> so i decided to go back to the above 60hz setting </s>
<s> and for whatever reason the wavy screen problem was gone </s>
<s> thank you for all your help </s>
<s> 59hz was indeed a little strange as almost all lcd panels are 60hz things </s>
<s> sorry but it s quite odd to find such a number today in the video settings </s>
<s> makes you wonder how that happened </s>
<s> my theory is that it had some crt display as default </s>
<s> good you sorted it out </s>
<s> bob </s>
