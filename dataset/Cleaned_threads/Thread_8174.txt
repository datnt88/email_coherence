<s> i have an epox ep 9nda3j socket 939 amd athlon 64 motherboard that supports sata and ide hardrives </s>
<s> i am purchasing a new hardrive and would like to upgrade to a sata 80g drive </s>
<s> i also have 2 60gb ide drives one of which i would like to use in either a raid configuration or to store data </s>
<s> my questions are these will i have any difficulties using both a sata and ide drive in a raid configuration </s>
<s> will i have any difficulties transfering data from one to the other if i do not use a raid configuration </s>
<s> do i need to have two operating systems installed on both drives to use a raid configuration </s>
<s> what specs should i look for in a sata hardrive so i notice a difference in speed </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> i was thinking of purchasing this sata hardrive </s>
<s> any thoughts on this drive </s>

<s> what are you using your pc for </s>
<s> what do you think raid will do for you </s>
<s> how are you backing up your system </s>
<s> why 80gb when you get get much more diskspace without spending much more </s>
<s> for about 100 you can get state of the art 200 or 250gb hdd </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i do some gaming </s>
<s> i guess i would like to do a raid 0 configuration to speed up my gaming </s>
<s> my understanding is that i do not need a second operating system installed to do this </s>
<s> i guess then my questions are narrowed down to these am i going to have a problem running raid 0 configuration with a 80 gb sized sata hardrive and a 60gb ide hardrive </s>
<s> if not does anyone have any recommendations for a hardrive </s>
<s> lastly what steps will i need to utilize in order to implement this process </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> oh i forgot to ad currently i really do not have a solid backup plan </s>
<s> in the past i have used a 1gb thumbdrive to back up important documents and other items of importance some i would just drop into my second hardrive </s>
<s> i would do this by using the backup utility that comes with windows xp </s>
<s> could i even use a 3rd drive as a backup in another raid configuration </s>
<s> it appears i do not want to set up a raid 0 configuration it looks to risky </s>
<s> can i do a raid 1 with a sata drive and an ide drive </s>
<s> lastly any recommendations for a sata drive </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> to the best of my knowledge you cannot mix sata and pata ide drives in the same raid array </s>
<s> most of the configurations i ve seen recommend using the same make model and capacity drive when you re building a raid array </s>
<s> re raid help me understand why you want to use raid at all </s>
<s> sata hdds take a look at storagereview com tomshardware com anandtech com etc </s>
<s> then look a newegg com and see the buyer comments on the specific products you re interested in </s>
<s> in real life sata drives don t give you much more performanvce if any over the corresponding pata drives </s>
<s> the major benefit is they allow addition of more drives to the system they don t require jumpering and they use less cumbersome cabling </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> as luck would have it here s something directly from kim komando at komando com on raid quot using raid to backup data q i ve lost two hard drives and had to rebuild stuff twice in a year so the concept of raid is starting to sound appealing </s>
<s> i only know enough about raid to be dangerous so can you explain it </s>
<s> is this a good way to back up my computer </s>
<s> a i have a definite position on your question maybe but probably not </s>
<s> before i explain that let s talk about raid </s>
<s> that s an acronym for redundant array of independent disks </s>
<s> there are a number of ways to set up raid </s>
<s> i won t bore you with that </s>
<s> you re talking about raid1 or mirroring so let s focus on that </s>
<s> mirroring simply means that you have two drives and they have exactly the same things on them </s>
<s> when you save a document it is saved on both hard drives </s>
<s> if the primary drive fails you switch to the other </s>
<s> mirroring has long been used in internet servers </s>
<s> with it a company doesn t have to worry about its web site going down if a drive fails </s>
<s> the secondary drive immediately takes over </s>
<s> that could be helpful to you if you suffer drive failures </s>
<s> however i don t think raid works well for backups </s>
<s> when you establish a backup routine you should back up your data day after day </s>
<s> that way you can go back in time to find uncorrupted data if necessary </s>
<s> let me give you an example </s>
<s> say you have an important database file </s>
<s> one day the file will not open </s>
<s> something has happened and the file is corrupted </s>
<s> the data in that file is no longer available </s>
<s> if you have a raid mirror setup the file on the backup drive will probably be in exactly the same shape </s>
<s> instead of being able to go to a backup from last week or last month which is presumably uncorrupted you have only a current corrupted file </s>
<s> so although mirroring has its benefits they pertain more to commercial situations </s>
<s> some computers including my office machine have raid0 or striping </s>
<s> this divides data between two hard drives supposedly making read and write operations faster </s>
<s> again i think the benefit is marginal on the desktop </s>
<s> you should have a backup routine for your data </s>
<s> at home i copy my data to a second hard drive at work to the server </s>
<s> you could combine your backup routine with an imaging program such as norton ghost </s>
<s> an imaging program allows you to take a picture of the hard drive which you can use if your hard drive fails </s>
<s> but the image is static </s>
<s> so you need regular backups as you change or add files </s>
<s> i considered installing a raid setup when i built my home computer two years ago </s>
<s> i intended to use it for backups but i decided raid was inadequate </s>
<s> my advice is don t bother quot </s>
<s> so i cannot use my ide harddrive with a sata hardrive as my primary </s>
<s> you ll have to try that one all of mine have been ide primary with sata secondary or sata sata </s>
<s> let us know </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> bump </s>
<s> what s bump </s>
