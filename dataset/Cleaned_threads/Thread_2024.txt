<s> hello everyone i was wondering if anyone can help me </s>
<s> i have a linksys wireless g broadband router model no wrt54g </s>
<s> the router s red diag light stays always red </s>
<s> i went into the linksys technical support for help and followed the instructions on how to fix the problem on the page i got as far as testing the communication between the router and the network card </s>
<s> it seems that the router established a connection but when i test the communication with ping 192 168 1 1 it say request timed out could anyone please advise me on what to do </s>
<s> thank you any help is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> connected properly on the correct port </s>
<s> good day regarding w your concern sir mataharimata if the red diag light lit up and always stays red it means that it may be have a software or hardware failure on the unit </s>
<s> the only way to troubleshoot the device is just to reset it twice for 20 30secs </s>
<s> after that try to ping the routers ip addr </s>
<s> w c is 192 168 1 1 if it still getting a request time out pinging the rotuers ip addr </s>
<s> try usign another pc to ping the router </s>
<s> once youve done all this troubleshooting steps and still unable to ping or get replys pinging the routers ip addr </s>
<s> it only means that the router is deffective or theres already a hardware failure on it </s>
<s> i hope this may help you </s>
<s> thanks and have a productive day ahead </s>
<s> i ve heard that sometimes the solid red diag light is due to a weak or malfunctioning ac adaptor </s>
<s> make sure that the replacement has the same ratings and polarity </s>

<s> good luck </s>
