<s> i have an older compaq computer 5320 ca from about 2002 i m using windows xp </s>
<s> i used it for a couple of years then not for approximately 2 years </s>
<s> i have been using it for the last year without any problems </s>
<s> on saturday it is now thursday after about 5 hours my computer started to freeze to the point where it was no longer sending data and my mouse wouldn t work it lasted a minute then was find for a while then started to freeze more regularly once i turned it off i got a few more hours before it would start freezing again </s>
<s> each day the amount of time i would get before it froze has been getting shorter and shorter to the point today where it started almost immediately </s>
<s> now it is freezing about every minute or two for a minute or so </s>
<s> at some point in the last week my cd burner quit working ie does not recognize when a cd is put into it </s>
<s> once it starts its freezing issues the cd burner has a red light on </s>
<s> the last few times i have tried to turn my computer off it will not fully shut off competely </s>
<s> it does into shutdown mode but will not actually turn off </s>
<s> i thought originally it was a virus but i did a virus scan and it found nothing so then i did a factory reset and cleaned my computer </s>
<s> i thought maybe it was the fan not working but i have a fan on it and that is not working it has actually gotten worse </s>
<s> any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly welcomed </s>
<s> the symptoms sound like this needs doing </s>
<s> i just did the fan cleaning today i will let you know how it turns out and if my problem goes away </s>
<s> this problem never goes away entirely </s>
<s> i was at one of the usual stores today and a few machines were frozen </s>
