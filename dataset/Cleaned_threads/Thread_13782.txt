<s> my dell xps 600 has sata hard drive is there a way to add an ide hard drive i do not find anything in the bios that will all me the change this </s>
<s> but i toss old ide drives into usb cases when i need to access them </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> your specs show no immediate support for pata type eide hds </s>
<s> unless the cd drives have use of an eide port then you may install an ide hd but it won t be quick or as desirable other than it can be used </s>
<s> if you plan to use some old ide hd you may have to look at some adapter to attach on ide drive then i f with sata port </s>
<s> imo you would be better served simply to have a sata type drive to install </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> if you have the dell xps 600 motherboard nforce4 sli xh241 it sure looks like there is an ide connection </s>
<s> open the case and have a look </s>
<s> you won t need to change anything set the jumper on the ide hd to slave </s>
<s> just connect to existing ide cable and reload your xp cd </s>
<s> do a full format it should work like any other reload </s>
