<s> i think my cd dvd rom drive is the problem </s>
<s> whenever i play dvd s it will play for a bit and the kind of freeze up where it comes to a complete stop and appears the same way as if i had put it on pause </s>
<s> but it isn t </s>
<s> i know its not the dvds because they work in a normal dvd player and it happens with any dvd s ive been putting in my computer </s>
<s> however i have had no problem with cd roms or audio disks at all </s>
<s> does anyone know how to fix this problem </s>
<s> or if it is a problem with my computer and not actually the drive itself </s>
<s> did you supply enough information </s>
<s> try installing the latest version of the dvd player on your computer </s>
<s> try other players if possible like vlc media player </s>
<s> if it does not help try swaping your dvd drive </s>
<s> i think it is your dvd drive which causing the problem </s>
<s> good luck </s>
