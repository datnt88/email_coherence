<s> my network admin has told me that a wireless access link takes up more bandwidth off of our network then a regular router </s>
<s> does anyone know if wireless takes up more bandwidth then a regular lan network </s>
<s> i haven t heard this one before </s>
<s> you may want to just nod and move along </s>
<s> or ask for a web article showing such </s>
<s> sounds like another urban legend </s>
<s> best of luck bob </s>
<s> due to the fact that the connection uses rf radio frequency there is probably more overhead </s>
<s> which could equate to a little more bandwidth </s>
<s> but unless you have several hundred wireless connections it s probably not noticeable </s>
