<s> hello im looking for someone who has a bit more knowledge about agp video cards and bios setting than i do </s>
<s> im considering upgrading my video card from 256mb to 512mb </s>
<s> i have a dell dimension 8300 i was poking around the systems settings accessible before the os boots up and i noticed a setting for agp aperture </s>
<s> i can set it for 32mb 64mb 128mb or 256mb </s>
<s> what is the significance of these settings </s>
<s> the manual makes no mention of them </s>
<s> what would happen if i installed an agp card with 512mb of memory </s>
<s> it wouldnt work </s>
<s> only 256 out of 512 mbs would be used because the agp aperture setting only goes up to 256mb </s>
<s> anyone out there have experience with this sort of thing </s>
<s> read a few of these </s>
<s> thanks </s>
