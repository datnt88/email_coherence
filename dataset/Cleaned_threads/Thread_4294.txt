<s> i ve heard that since seagate bought out maxtor their hd s have gone downhill fast </s>
<s> can anyone tell me if there are certain drives in particular that are problematical </s>
<s> are there seagate maxtor drives and seagate drives </s>
<s> if concerned just get the seagate model </s>
<s> i will note that certain maxtor sata ii models require a firmware upgrade to function properly with nforce3 and nforce4 chipsets </s>
<s> this is documented at maxtor com </s>
<s> i guess i ll have to email support </s>
<s> i m looking for external drives and offhand there s no labeling or such that tells me i m getting a seagate or maxtor </s>
<s> and internal hard drive and install it in an external enclosure </s>
