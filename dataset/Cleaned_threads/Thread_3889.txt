<s> anyone have some advice on a reasonabel priced exteral hard drive 40 60gb any info would be appreciated </s>
<s> but i think today s drives are very reasonable compared to what we paid a few years ago </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> they generally don t offer 60s any more but you can get 40s and 80s </s>
<s> wd and seagates will be in the low 50 range for 40 gigs and about 4 more to double the size </s>
<s> of course if you expect you ll never approach 40 gigs you can still get a burger without fries for the difference </s>
<s> in australia maxtor are selling their 80gb ext hd for 99 </s>
<s> i think that is reasonable </s>
<s> they were 149 </s>
<s> however when i bought one and left it plugged in and connected to the power after a short time just a day or two the light went out i took it back got a replacement and the same thing happened again </s>
<s> now i am being told that maybe i should not have left it plugged into the power so long </s>
<s> perhaps i should have only turned it on when i wanted to use it and then turn it off as soon as i had finished my quot backup quot </s>
<s> it was only the power cord that stuffed up and i could not get a new replacement cord and keep the hd </s>
<s> i had to return the whole lot </s>
<s> now i am going to get a lacie 160gb which is going to cost a heck of a lot more but what can i do </s>
<s> i still think the power cord should not have malfunctioned like it did </s>
<s> lots of people are leaving things plugged into the power all the time so why not an external hard drive </s>
<s> try walking into a store </s>
<s> staples often has random deals </s>
<s> i got a maxtor ext hd 80gb for 80 </s>
<s> try checking out best buy comop usa etc </s>
<s> else try online places like newegg or search on pricewatch or pricegrabber </s>
<s> 60gb ext hd should be no more than 60 </s>
