<s> i acquired an older dell optiplex gx520 desktop version computer and decided to ramp it up a bit </s>
<s> i put in a samsung ssd and started to upgrade the ram </s>
<s> i put 4gb 2gbx2 but the computer started to freeze on boot up </s>
<s> i have windows 7 ultimate 64bit </s>
<s> if i take out one ram and put in a different one 1gb total of 3gb it starts up no problem </s>
<s> i have just dealt with the 3gb </s>
<s> now i wanted to upgrade the video card since the on board graphics were crappy </s>
<s> i put in an hix 5450 since it is the best pci only card out there this motherboard doesn t have a pci express </s>
<s> now i am encountering the same problem with this as the ram upgrade where it freezes on the windows start up screen </s>
<s> any help would be great </s>

<s> i find it reasonable before attempting anything with a dell as in upgrades to be sure of the bios level </s>
<s> more often that not there can be quite a difference </s>
<s> so if you check and find a06 present and a11 available do upgrade the bios and correctly follow instructions </s>
<s> next exactly what are your dell specs for your model plus its sn or use the service tag to truly id the product </s>
<s> in other words don t settle for the dell badge know exactly what you have </s>
<s> then review the specs of your model found </s>
<s> the info can vary if an user simply accepts model across the board does this and that and the model can vary as model a is different from model d even though both are dell model123 </s>
<s> there can be a major difference so be 100 sure </s>
<s> i would for testing disable or remove the virtual clonedrive </s>
<s> upgrade the bios and verify your gx520 actually can use 2gb ram per slot </s>
<s> also ram is best as in matched pairs </s>
<s> yes win7x64 can use above 4gb and or can the intel p4 single core really keep up if i suspect all of what your doing is pushing the cpu to its limits </s>
<s> it maybe a quot bottleneck quot sort of problem </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i figured out the issue with the ram and the new video card </s>
<s> i needed to update my bios to work with them </s>
<s> once i upgraded to a11 it worked perfect </s>
<s> i had a little interesting time flashing the bios since i had window 7 x64 </s>
<s> but i had an extra hdd that had 32 bit windows xp plugged it in ran the flash and perfecto it worked </s>
<s> today is going to be a good day i can feel it </s>
