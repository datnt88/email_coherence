<s> mother board asus a7v8x x cpu 1st try was amd athlon t bird 1 33 ghz 266 pga cpu 2nd try was amd athlon xp 1800 1 53 ghz tbred memory ddram 256 m pc 2700 990961 mushkin r video ati radeon 7000 32 m ddr power supply 300 watts with the first mother board and t bird cpu with total system hooked up when you turned the power supply on the green led on the mobo came on and stayed on </s>
<s> when you pushed the start button the cooling fans would run for 5 seconds and turn off </s>
<s> the green led stayed lit </s>
<s> if you removed the cpu the fans would run continuously when started but of course the computer was not running </s>
<s> i tried the cpu in another computer and it worked </s>
<s> i tried two powers supplies 300 watts that working in other computers </s>
<s> i rmaed that mother board </s>
<s> with the 2nd mother board and the same peripherals i got the same problem </s>
<s> i looked more closely at the asus site and they did not list the amd thunder bird athlon for that board so i rmaed the cpu for an amd athlon xp 1800 that was on the asus list for that motherboard </s>
<s> when i installed that cpu on the 2nd mother board and hooked up everything or just the cpu and the memory i got the same thing except the cooling fans would power up now for just 1 second and power down </s>
<s> on both boards all jumpers were in the default positions according to the manual </s>
<s> i have built 7 computers from parts and i have never had this problem </s>
<s> i don t know what to do next </s>
<s> new egg com where i purchased the parts is willing to rma the whole pile again but they do not inspect test or check anything before it leaves so i can t tell if it works when it leaves their facility </s>
<s> has anyone out there every had this problem </s>
<s> could it be the power supplies are too small at 300 watts </s>
<s> i know the power supply is staying on through all of this because the green led stays lit </s>
<s> the cpu seems to be telling the system to shut down to stand by </s>
<s> i do not have a heat transfer sticker between the cpu and the heat sink because this makes it very hard to get the cpu out of the socket when you can t get the heat sink off </s>
<s> do the four rubber pads on the top of the cpu hold the heat sink away from the chip on the cpu when there is no heat transfer sticker </s>
<s> could the cpu be shutting things down in one second because they get too hot instantly </s>
<s> i appreciate any input </s>
<s> jim </s>
<s> if you are using just the amd and a bare metal heatsink you re lucky they fixed that amd burnout problem </s>
<s> you ll use the heatsink compound or the transfer tape </s>
<s> use nothing and you ve explained your problem </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the quick reply </s>
<s> i haven t used an amd processor since i built a 486 </s>
<s> i ve used intels since then so i am unaware of quot that amd burnout problem quot </s>
<s> so the heat builds up so fast that it will power down in one second </s>
<s> would that explain why the t bird powered down after 5 seconds repeatedly but the athlon xp only runs for one second </s>
<s> more power heat in the xp </s>
<s> do you think there is contact between the aluminum heat sink and the actual chip face when there is no transfer tape </s>
<s> i see four rubber pads that might keep the two faces apart </s>
<s> the pads are there to provide a uniform contact surface between the hsf and cpu </s>
<s> you do not want to use a cpu without them </s>
<s> i would not assemble an athlon based machine without heat compound or the tape its cpu suicide without it </s>
<s> try reducing the number of parts down to power supply hsf cpu with compound onboard speaker </s>
<s> see if you get a beep </s>
<s> in addition you might want to take the board out of the box and try it on a peice of cardboard you might be shorting out somewhere </s>
<s> i have used nothing but athlons in the systems i have built and must inform you that efficient heat transfer for this chip is critical and indeed amd go to great pains to stress this </s>
<s> this would be accentated with the barton core as the die has less area of contact with the heat sink </s>
<s> thermal interface material is required on all amd processors </s>
<s> dear jim amd motherboard is very easily cook up get icute power supply 400 watts or more is more stable user friendly to use especially amd </s>
<s> second change your cooling fan to extremely faster fan such as cooler master or any bigger and expensive type of cooler fan for amd type </s>
<s> if you enough money get a better ventalation casing like icute that include six fan it really help to cool down a lot at cpu motherboard and other parts when switch on </s>
<s> this is greatest advise for amd case </s>
<s> joseph </s>
<s> lot of talk about a simple issue </s>
<s> lets condense it did you use heat compound or the tape version </s>
<s> no then do so </s>
<s> yes move on </s>
<s> joseph pointed out something i noticed right away </s>
<s> power supply </s>
<s> even a good 300w ps is probably too small for what you have in your box </s>
<s> i have roughly the same setup and run a 400w ps </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> this looks like a bad power supply </s>
<s> the smps is unable to supply all the required voltages </s>
<s> try changing it </s>
<s> that s how it worked for me </s>
<s> hi there </s>
<s> your problem you had details exactly the problem i am having now </s>
<s> did you ever figure this out </s>
<s> was it the heat on the processor </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i have a phenom 9850 msi am2 board </s>
<s> i leave the computer on 90 of the time and built it myself about 2 3 years ago </s>
<s> i came home today and my computer was off </s>
<s> i thought an automatic update took place and the machine shut off and just did not start back up the machine would do the same as your symptoms were </s>
<s> i finally took the side off and found my heatsink was not seated </s>
<s> i went to reattatch it and found a plastic ear was broken </s>
<s> the broken ear is on a square plastic ring about 3 1 2 quot x 4 quot held to the motherboard by 4 philips screws </s>
<s> so my question is does anyone sell the square ring by itself </s>
<s> i have a feeling i m going to have salvage one from an old amd computer </s>
<s> except on ebay or as part of a new heat sink system </s>
<s> i won t admit i ve crafted temporary fixes with tie wraps </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> look here depending on the cpu intel or amd and socket type i have seen these in retail but much to find on ebay </s>
