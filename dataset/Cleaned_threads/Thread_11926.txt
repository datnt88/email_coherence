<s> hello my imac intel core duo running 10 4 11 about 2 years old has never had any problems connecting to my wifi box via airport then suddenly it won t work any more nothing changed just one day to another </s>
<s> airport status is connected to my wifi network but there is no internet connection </s>
<s> the connection via ethernet cable works fine so it can t be an isp or router problem in any case my mac laptop has no trouble picking up the wifi and when i search other neighbour networks via airport it gets me to their isp login page so i doubt its a hardware problem </s>
<s> called apple who said i d probably need to reset the wifi airport system configuration and create a new location but for her to talk me through it with no guarantee of a fix would cost me </s>
<s> so i tried to do what i can deleting certain system files etc but i don t really know what i m doing and nothing has worked so far </s>
<s> can anyone help </s>
<s> thanks so much in advance </s>
<s> when i read a post like this i know i want to swap in another wifi router and not touch the apple or pcs </s>
<s> as my laptop sat on the desk next to the imac picks up the wifi from the same box no problem </s>
<s> could that still be a router malfunction </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the router is misconfigured as in mac filters </s>
<s> but that is not what is written to use in this forum s sticky </s>
<s> the settings do matter but your post still has me trying another router if the settings are good </s>
