<s> so apple just released a bunch of new laptop upgrades and the all new macbook air </s>
<s> but wait </s>
<s> i bought my laptop in september white macbook and i got a apple remote when i bought it </s>
<s> now for all the laptops including the macbook pro you need to pay an additional 20 bucks when you are purchasing it at the apple store online </s>
<s> now i love macs and it think the remote was a cool feature and partially justified the high price tag </s>
<s> but now they are making you pay for it </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> does anyone else notice this </s>
<s> quot yes you like this quot in your most gruff voice </s>
<s> quot yes you buy with that quot isn t choice a good thing </s>
<s> but i did like having the remote included </s>
<s> then again some people never use it </s>
<s> i use it occasionally but not for front row </s>
<s> ipod docks with speakers work nice with it though </s>
<s> i wish they had used the air keyboard for the new models </s>
<s> i think the mbp keyboard could be better </s>
<s> but the new trackpad feature looks good </s>
<s> it s not like you would use the remote while you are using the mac anyway </s>
<s> unless you use front row constantly lol </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> 2 99 </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> there is justice </s>
<s> to unaware customers </s>
<s> reminds of the day the imacs came out in august </s>
<s> i was in the store when they were announced and they were still selling the other imacs for full price </s>
<s> at least the previous mbps seem to priced well on the apple refurb section but then you d have to figure out if it was an unsold model or an actual refurb </s>
<s> not much justice there for some people </s>
<s> sigh this is a repeat of the last refresh for me i got my original mbp a month before the santa rosa models came out and then it was replaced with the said model a month before this penryn upgrade ironic isn t it </s>
<s> ah but that s how it always is with apple </s>
<s> guess i should get used to it </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> i think choice is a good thing r proffitt </s>
<s> but the prices didnt change </s>
<s> sure you get more but its because of technological advancements </s>
<s> i think if you dont want it the macbook should start at 1079 so you dont waste your money </s>
<s> but whatever </s>
<s> o and yes the mbp need new keyboards </s>
<s> i think it be nice if the macbook had illuminated keys but the mbp is the only mac that doesnt use the new keyboard </s>
<s> seems to smack of some gazpacho creed as noted above </s>
<s> next thing you find is they ll want a credit card number when you buy an iphone </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that sounds vaguely familiar but i can t place it </s>
<s> you could say that the remote was part of that 750 upgrade to 4gb of ram when the remote was included in the price </s>
<s> now it s 400 and they offer the remote for a separate 20 </s>
<s> better deal right </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> omg apple should include the remote </s>
<s> i mean you are already paying higher prices then for a normal pc with the same stats and apple had to go to all the trouble as to remove a tiny remote </s>
<s> just include it already </s>
<s> its 20 bucks how much money does apple need </s>
<s> i mean i dont care as much about how much it is to add on it could be 1 dollar for all i care </s>
<s> the principal is that you have to buy it separately </s>
<s> and why is it included with the imacs then </s>
<s> well whatever but yes the 400 dollar 4 gig a ram is nice </s>
<s> 850 had no chance of selling </s>
<s> fyi amazon sells four gigs of memory for the macbook for 113 bucks </s>
<s> this sounds like we just need to skip 2 latte s </s>
<s> ok so you can get the remote for 3 bucks </s>
<s> but still apples big qoute is quot ready to use right out of the box quot i mean is throwing a tiny little remote in the package that big of a loss for apple </s>
<s> it just annoys me that they cut it out cause i thought that was something nice that apple did that a lot of pc companies dont include </s>
<s> this is a long standing issue such as whether all the cables should come in some box in spite that not everyone needs them </s>
<s> gt isn t this an unjust tax on the rest of us </s>
<s> you don t need the remote if you don t plan on using it </s>
<s> if you do 20 is not a lot to shell out for when you are buying apple products </s>
<s> and then look at the things apple has cut prices on notebook ram hd costs and of course the notebook models themselves </s>
<s> it is indeed quite fair </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> i m betting most people wouldn t use it because front row is somewhat of a joke when it comes to genuine htpc style use so it s perhaps used as a look how cool this is feature for the first two months and then cast aside by most </s>
<s> there is also a design issue as well in that it s almost shaped like an expresscard remote but isn t </s>
<s> you can now get apple remote clones which fit into the expresscard slot the remotes of my xps m s click into the card slot so it s just the thing to take away along with the notebook so i can enjoy vista media center on the move </s>
<s> so with the apple remotes you kind of have to find a place to put it which isn t on the notebook and that s kind of inelegant </s>
<s> the remote is not what i thought was janky </s>
<s> it is kind of superfluous although given apple s mumblings towards digital hub i guess a media remote wouldn t be too much to ask </s>
<s> however since their htpc attempt isn t a serious offering i guess it is too much to ask </s>
<s> but i digress </s>
<s> the omission of the remote isn t janky </s>
<s> the ethernet dongle for the air </s>
<s> now that s janky </s>
<s> i know you dont need the remote and that not everyone uses it </s>
<s> but i mean come on all im saying is that it was dumb for apple to do </s>
<s> apple products as i mentioned before are more pricey and i know the price of all the hd and memory came down </s>
<s> but technology advances and therefore prices must come down the macbook upgrades have been the same price for over 9 months so the price drop is nice </s>
<s> but still why did apple take it out </s>
<s> they used to have it so why did the suddenly drop it out </s>
<s> and ok you must agree with me on this </s>
<s> it would have been nicer if apple hadnt dropped it </s>
<s> even if you dont ever use it there must be some time when you have felt like you just wanted the remote </s>
<s> if you dont just put it away somewhere but still you have to admit it would be nicer for apple to include it in the box </s>
<s> though i do think there are more useful things they could give u i think they should have gave you a bluetooth mouse in the remotes place </s>
<s> that be nice </s>
<s> yeah i think the air is cool but come on </s>
<s> at least give us ethernet </s>
<s> i could survive with out the disk drive but no ethernet and only 1 usb </s>
<s> apple just squeeze another port on the other side </s>
<s> i hardly ever use my remote and not for front row </s>
<s> god that application is an embarassment to anything that is a frontend </s>
<s> i use it for itunes occasionally </s>
<s> the macbook hair is an overpriced joke </s>
<s> notice that front row and the apple tv interface are very similar in some ways </s>
<s> the tv has yet to kick off but it may when apple includes more features </s>
<s> the same with front row </s>
<s> however i liked the front row interface in tiger better than the new leopard version </s>
<s> plus itunes does not open when you play music and videos so if you exit the media stops playing but that s probably because front row is its own app now and not an add on kind of feature </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> true it s expensive and for today s standards it is viewed as under powered </s>
<s> but i am beginning to like this idea </s>
<s> it isn t supposed to powerful it s supposed to be mobile </s>
<s> throw that together with one of the best operating systems and all the necessary applications for editing and whatnot and it s a great tool to have </s>
<s> the market the air is aimed at is relatively small but that hasn t affected the strong sales </s>
<s> today most people see any computer with under 2 0ghz as a terrible machine but the clock speed does not completely define the computer </s>
<s> compared to its competition the air is more powerful even if it only has quot 1 6 or 1 8ghz quot </s>
<s> if unsupported power macs clocking in at around 400mhz can run leopard at a somewhat normal speed than this thing is even more powerful </s>
<s> i think you have to give apple some credit for putting this together </s>
<s> the air isn t supposed to have all of the other features that the rest of the mac family has </s>
<s> and it s not supposed to be a primary machine for most people but i m sure that you could make it one </s>
<s> bmf </s>
<s> leopard s requirements are a g4 867mhz </s>
<s> several people around the net have reported success with installing leopard on many many unsupported macs meaning they have g4 or g3 cpus clocking under the 867mhz mark </s>
<s> some people have managed to install it on their powerbook g3s pismos with g4 upgrades which is pretty good for an eight nine year old notebook </s>
<s> i was just pointing out that if far older technology can run the same system as the air at a reasonable speed and usability than the air should have no trouble whatsoever for basic tasks </s>
<s> the air has a lot of potential </s>
<s> in time users looking for a ssd will be able to get it cheaper </s>
<s> firewire might be added to its small array of ports </s>
<s> apple did patent something like that for more ports awhile ago the air is only on its first generation so there s a lot of room for improvement </s>
<s> just give it time </s>
<s> the first ipods were mac only and did not work very well as i recall </s>
<s> the latest ipods support windows and run very smoothly </s>
<s> just wait </s>
<s> bmf </s>
