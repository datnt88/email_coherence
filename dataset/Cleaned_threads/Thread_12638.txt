<s> i have a generic graphics card with the sis 300 305 chipset 32 mb ram </s>
<s> recently i upgraded to windows xp and had to download new drivers for the card from the sis website </s>
<s> the problem is that whenever i run a game in opengl it is way too dark </s>
<s> with windows 98 me there was full set of utilities with the driver software that allowed me to adjust the brightness levels </s>
<s> however there is no such feature with the present drivers </s>
<s> as a result i cannot play any game in open gl because it is too dark to view </s>
<s> does anyone have any suggestions to correct this problem </s>
<s> i can only note but will not be able to tell you which driver may solve your issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had this problem on my compaq </s>
<s> i go to active desktop customize settings advanced and there you will find a correction in my case it is called gamma correction but it may be called something else just turn it up </s>
<s> this may be what you re looking for </s>
