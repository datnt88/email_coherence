<s> hi all i have been experiencing some issues with my pc lately and today i replaced the video card to see if that would solve them however after swapping video cards windows wont load </s>
<s> it gets to the starting windows screen and then goes black and then restarts the computer </s>
<s> i have tried returning to the original video card but the same thing happens i have also tried disabling the other hard drives and installing another with a working windows on it however the computer still restarts at the same point </s>
<s> i have also tried resetting the bios by unplugging the computer and removing the battery to restore the original settings with no result </s>
<s> i don t know what i could have done to have caused this </s>
<s> is it a particular piece of hardware that is faulty </s>
<s> any ideas appreciated </s>
<s> or windows is not installed for this hardware </s>
<s> does a fresh install do same </s>
<s> remember you decide what to share and as it stands all i can offer is to pop in a fresh drive and install windows </s>
<s> i can t see make model age story to give out the other ideas </s>

<s> solved it windows was installed on the drive the cause was a bad ram stick </s>
<s> thanks anyway guys </s>
<s> be aware that faulty ram can cause corrupt hdd content </s>
<s> pretty well discussed but be on the lookout and hope you have backup copies of what you can t lose </s>
