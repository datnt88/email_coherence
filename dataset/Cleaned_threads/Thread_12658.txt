<s> recently i have begun looking into digital notepads </s>
<s> however all of them seem to require paper which is something i definately don t want </s>
<s> some e readers like the iliad have got a similar function but they are expensive and i don t need the e reader functions </s>
<s> a pc tablet is not an option because i want it to function independantly from my laptop while still being able to see what i m writing doodling </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> wacom offers the cintiq and adesso offers the cybertablet </s>
<s> i too am searching for a viable paperless option </s>
<s> good luck in your search </s>
<s> i am looking for like a digital etch n sketch </s>
<s> just something i can use word on and doodle with </s>
<s> thats all </s>
<s> i want to see what im doing with out paper </s>
<s> if anyone knows of any please let me know </s>
<s> if you re still looking for something i d recommend checking out the infinity binder it s very cheap and works easily with and android ios smartphone or tablet </s>
