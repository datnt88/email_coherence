<s> a problem that many students have including me you can pay almost the same price to get imac with good specs like core 2 duo 1 gb ram 128 mb vga 20 quot monitor etc </s>
<s> or macbook with good specs but a 64 vga and small 13 quot screen </s>
<s> i know that they are in different categories but i live in egypt and i m going to canada after a month and i don t know how will a laptop help my studying in the canadian high schools </s>
<s> anyway there is no right or wrong about this thing all i want is to know some opinions from people who knows about it </s>
<s> thanks alot </s>
<s> next you might ask that question of your fellow students for a response that better reflects the opinions of someone your own age </s>
<s> my wife has a macbook and i have an imac </s>
<s> the macbook is nice and portable but i do a lot of multi media stuff movie editing music graphics work etc </s>
<s> i find working with an imac is much easier for doing this stuff </s>
<s> the macbook with a small screen and scrunched keyboard is too small </s>
<s> also the imac has more firewire usb audio in audio out speaker plug etc </s>
<s> that makes it much easier to plug external equipment in and also run my imac speakers all in a neat package </s>
<s> but the macbook is portable and i can download movies and music and take it with me </s>
<s> i just like the space and the quot open quot work environment that the imac gives me </s>
<s> well i guess you re right and for the first time i found someone who though like me actually i m a composer and i work with softwares that require a big monitor and also rams </s>
<s> thanx for your opinion </s>
<s> if you re planning on going to college after high school i d say go for the macbook because its great to have the portability so you can take it to lectures use wifi and everything else </s>
