<s> i recently bought a sapphire x1950pro pci e i uninstalled my onboard card s drivers went to the ati website updatedd the drivers got ccc 7 7 i start up oblivion change the video settings start playing </s>
<s> after about 20 minutes the game crashes and it shows the quot this program has encountered a problem and needs to close quot thingy </s>
<s> then i start half life 2 lost coast </s>
<s> this time 5 minutes into the game it crashes </s>
<s> i tried thehitman bm demo and it crashed </s>
<s> i tried again and i played it all the way through with no problems </s>
<s> then it started geting worse whenxp started up some 4 or five programs failed to start up </s>
<s> even internet explorer crashes every once in a while </s>
<s> then it went from quot x program has encountered a problem quot to quot failed to start x dll quot </s>
<s> i even got the blue screen that says quot windows has shutdown because of a system error </s>
<s> if this is the first time you see this screen blahblahblah quot i tried using the msi live update to look for updated bios but it says that version 1 00 is the latest </s>
<s> this is my motherboard i ve tried a system restore so it is not a virus </s>
<s> what else could cause so much crashing </s>
<s> i am guessing it is my ram but i ve been using it for 5 months with no problems at all </s>
<s> is there some sort of utility that could help me find the problem </s>
<s> try re installing your onboard graphics drivers and re installing the drivers for your graphics card </s>
<s> it can t be your ram if it has never done this before you replaced your gpu </s>
<s> when i replaced my gpu all i did was install the new drivers for it and left everything else alone </s>
<s> the power supply </s>
<s> you could be stretching it thin there </s>
<s> not enough voltage could produce the same results </s>
<s> also make sure the card is seated correctly </s>
<s> how hot is the system getting </s>
<s> another area to look at </s>
<s> make sure all surfaces are dust free </s>
<s> especially the fan blades and fins on the heat sink </s>
<s> let us know </s>
