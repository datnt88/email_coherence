<s> will provide a dolby digital bitstream that you can pipe to your home theater receiver </s>
<s> that is where you will get the best posiable sound and most tweakable setup possiable i use the audigy2 and it sounds awesome after you tweak it any good speakers are cheap for its system or use a to spdif sony phillips digital interface connector to rca cables to hook to any hi fi equipment you may be having hey buddy could you turn that down b using the output connector on back of card you will see if you buy one when i set my card on rock stadium setting the echo feedback is awesome cranked up it just like rock concert sound has settings for jazz and all kinds as well even has a neat piano buit in you can play with your keyboard all in 5 1 surround what did you say i cant hear you b 33t </s>
