<s> hi usually i m pretty confident with it but evidently not with wireless routers </s>
<s> i have a belkin wireless g router with modem </s>
<s> according to the manual to set it up you 1 plug in the ethernet cord from between the belkin to your pc it all lights up like a xmas tree </s>
<s> check </s>
<s> 2 plug in the phone line to the belkin </s>
<s> cool more lights it seems to be connected </s>
<s> check </s>
<s> 3 type in 192 168 2 1 into the address bar of internet explorer and hit return </s>
<s> errrr i m then asked by ie how i d like to connect to the internet </s>
<s> what the </s>
<s> i assume its still trying to connect with my old modem </s>
<s> if i disconnect the belkin and connect to the internet with my previous bt modem again then i can go to 192 168 etc fine </s>
<s> but that s not really any use is it </s>
<s> what do i do </s>
<s> this is supposed to be easy </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> sounds like you successfully accessed the belkin outer s administration configuration page by going to 192 168 2 1 then the router asked you a question about how you would like to connect to the internet that is the router is asking you to configure it for use with your particular internet service </s>
<s> sounds normal </s>
<s> no sorry what i meant was i cant connect to the 192 168 page </s>
<s> because windows asks me to connect to the internet first </s>
<s> if i click work offline then i get the usual page </s>
<s> does your computer indicate that a successful wired not wireless connection has been made to the router </s>
<s> start gt connect to gt show all connections </s>
<s> hold in the reset button for 10 seconds while the router is powered on </s>
<s> now try any luck </s>

<s> define quot phone line quot </s>
<s> what kind of broadband connection do you have </s>
<s> after connecting everything have you tried rebooting </s>
<s> sometimes xp needs a reboot when hit with a new ip address </s>
<s> or you might open a command prompt and type in ipconfig release ipconfig renew just some thoughts </s>
