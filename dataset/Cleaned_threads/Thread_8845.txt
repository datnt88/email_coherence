<s> i m running windows xp </s>
<s> i have downloaded the latest smart pack </s>
<s> i have a firewall running disk drives work for everything else </s>
<s> if this matters when i restart my pc i get an box open up for the ez dub disk but then it tells me i need to install the nero software first </s>
<s> but when i try to load the installation cd i get the error message posted above </s>
<s> maybe you need to uninstall ezdub and install nero first </s>
<s> remember i don t have answers to why the os was reinstalled if the reinstall has all the drivers for the machine and more </s>
<s> for example i m working with assumptions such as the nero cd is the retail version </s>
