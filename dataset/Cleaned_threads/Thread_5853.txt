<s> building my new pc i have most of the parts already picked out but i need help deciding on which ati video card would best suit me </s>
<s> i have my eye on the aiw 9800 pro and the aiw x600 pro </s>
<s> the 9800 has 128 mb ram and is 8x agp and the x600 has 256 mb ram and is pci express </s>
<s> how do these two compare in performance </s>
<s> are the new x line of cards comprable the the previous line </s>
<s> e g </s>
<s> x600 9600 </s>
<s> i do not know much about video cards but i do know that their both different connection the aiw 9800 pro is agp and the other is pci i don t know but does your motherboard both have agp and pci connections but other than that i do not know which one will run better however you should read the specs on both video card and see which one has higher performance at certain values </s>
<s> u know what i am also in same exact dilema what to choose i am also seeking help from u from days i am searching reviews and forums but still no success so if u find any info do let me know at my email id mrfrantik softhome net regarding what to choose aiw 9800 pro and the aiw x600 pro </s>
<s> x600 has faster core and memory speed </s>
<s> and it s cheaper than 9800 pro </s>
<s> so i would have to go with that </s>
<s> you will probably need new mobo i doubt yours have a pci express x 16 slot </s>
<s> check out whosave com they might have something </s>
<s> under the computer components they list the video cards </s>
<s> what are you going to be doing </s>
<s> gaming </s>
<s> video editing </s>
<s> word and internet </s>
<s> agp is about topped out on its tech </s>
<s> if you need the high frame rates and shading for high end games </s>
<s> look to the pci express technology this path will allow you to upgrade to newer cards as they are developed </s>
<s> yes i am looking for it primarly for gaming and i am building my computer from scratch so getting a pci e mobo will be no problem </s>
<s> thanks to all for the advice </s>
<s> hey mrfrantik i just realized that the 9800 does come with ati s acclaimed remote but the x600 does not </s>
<s> that may account for the price difference </s>
