<s> man you will need an upgrade </s>
<s> bf2 is one of the most demanding pc games on your graphics card and also ram </s>
<s> i have the game well for ati at least a 9600 or 9800 pro </s>
<s> nvidia the requirements are steep ea recomends at least a 5700 or greater so i would go at least a 6600gt or 6800 you might have to upgrade your power supply if you choose the 6800 thats the 6800 6600gt 9800 pro those are all great cards </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> looks like i can get a refurb ati x800 series for around 150 200 how about them </s>
<s> i d have to upgrade my motherboard but it kind of could use it anyways </s>
<s> pretty much any x800 series video card performs well </s>
<s> the x800 series is stable btw and runs cooler than the 6800s </s>
