<s> ok so this is a long story however i will make it as short as possible for the sake of the forum i ve set up a vpn connection from a doc s office to a satalite office first using a netgear fvs318 at one end to a fvs114 at the other nothing but problems the vpn connection would intermittently drop out for no apparent reason one end uses a cable internet and the other uses a partial t1 so we narrows it dow the the fvs318 being old and dropping the connection so we ve changed it to using 2 fvs114 s it works and just fine however the doc also wants to be able to vpn from his house the problem is that when we setup any other vpn s from the main office the additional connection will connect but you cannot access anything on the remote lan which defeates the point of a vpn any suggestions on solving this problem or is that netgear routers just can t handle simotanious vpn s as advertised </s>
<s> thanks for any suggestions in advance </s>
<s> this is often an ip address issue </s>

<s> on the server open network connections folder r click the incoming connections icon and choose properties </s>
<s> in the incoming connections properties dialog box click the networking tab select tcp ip and click properties </s>
<s> the top check box quot allow callers to access my local area network quot should be ticked </s>
<s> below this are the 3 options for assigning ip addresses assign automatically using dhcp specify an address allow calling computer to specify its own ip address </s>
<s> the method your server is using needs to be matched by the client computer </s>
<s> i m not sure you entirely understood my problem and at this point i do have a little more specific info as well </s>
<s> here is a cut from the log file now using a fvs114 and the netgear vpn client software </s>
<s> keep in mind that there is already a vpn using this gateway that work properly as long as no other vpn s are enabled </s>
<s> that is between 2 fvs114 s </s>
<s> also keep in mind that i have a completely different vpn tunnel to a different office all together using the client software and is work fantastically and the vpn setups are almost identical with the exception of the ip addresses of course </s>

<s> vpns are a bit tough to get one s head wrapped around at first but once you get the idea that your lan vanishes and you are magically transported onto the host s vpn and must think as if you were at that office and plugged into that network then it all makes sense </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for the food for thought </s>
<s> the reason i am having such trouble grasping it is because according to netgear there product can support up to 8 simultaneous vpn tunnels </s>

<s> correct me if i m wrong but shouldn t i be able to connect more then 1 vpn tunnel to one place </s>

<s> lol background info those are the specs on the vpn router we are using to try and connect to </s>
<s> i guess i can t post the link so taking your concept of the vpn into consideration if my network is setup in a dhcp and the network i am trying to connect to is not and is set to allow the pc s to set there own ip s could that be causing a problem </s>

<s> bob </s>
<s> the vpn server is a netgear fvs114 that alone should give us access to the network since the other gateway end is the exact same thing from my understanding all the vpn connection is done through the routers not through any pc s then we are just using remote desktop to connect to other physical pc s and servers on the networks they can already be accessed in this way by an already existing vpn tunnel using the fvs114 at the quot main office quot and a satellite office now i have added another vpn tunnel to the fvs114 router at the main office and am trying to establish that vpn connection to my house it should work in the same way as the original tunnel however it is not </s>
<s> somethings amiss here or there is a bug in the firmware </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> while it happens less and less i ran into an isp that blocked vpn traffic </s>
<s> but i find this doubtful in your case since you claim the vpn connects but you can t ping the other side </s>

<s> because of that the pc s get there own ip s the problem came in when all the pc s in the office were pulling the wrong default gateway from the network making everything unaccessible i just had to change it to manually get the correct default gateway and everything works the part that stumped me was that there was an already existing gateway that was working no one knows how that was working </s>
