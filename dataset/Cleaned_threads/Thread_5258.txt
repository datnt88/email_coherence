<s> i have a microsoft mouse and it does not scroll properly in itunes its definitely not an hardware issue as i can scroll in any problem in all other applications eg </s>
<s> firefox safari its a microsoft wireless notebook laser mouse 6000 checked with a friend and his microsoft mouse also behaves this way </s>
<s> i didn t install any driver from the included cd or from anywhere else </s>
<s> im having the same problem with my microsoft wireless notebook mouse 4000 and i have no idea on how to solve </s>
<s> we have to ask microsoft </s>
<s> i beleive i have tracked it down to one of two services that itunes installs </s>
<s> these are ipahelper and applemobiledeviceservice </s>
<s> it is one of these two causing it </s>
<s> i have suspended both and the mouse movement is smooth again </s>
<s> i just have not taken the time to figure out which of the two it is since i do not need either to run i just suspend both </s>
<s> i do have a microsoft wireless laser desktop 6000 with the latest driver versions off the ms site ver 6 2 so it is not the ms drivers </s>
<s> install intellipoint onto your machine </s>
<s> copy the the microsoft intellipoint folder from program files to somewhere else </s>
<s> uninstall intellipoint </s>
<s> restart find your mouse in the device manager </s>
<s> update the drivers with the drivers in the intellipoint folder </s>
<s> my mouse scrolls fine now even after a restart </s>
