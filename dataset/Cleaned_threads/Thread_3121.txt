<s> i have a 3 5 quot samsung hdd from a computer that was dead and converted it to a external hard drive but when i tried to format with easus partition software i got an error message that the format could not be completed and a second later a message that the usb storage driver could not be detected since then i have tried many ways to connect the external hdd but it s not recognized since then </s>
<s> any ideas of what could it be and how could i solve it </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> why not use the partion and format tools that windows offers </s>
<s> i can t be specific here as i can t find which os </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am using windows 7 and i couldn t use the windows tool because i wanted to create 2 partitions one with like 100gb in fat32 so i could use it to backup my ps3 data while the rest of the hdd in ntfs </s>
<s> since there are limitations for fat32 partitions when using the windows tool i had to use another partition software </s>
<s> such details would change my answer to quot use gparted quot bob </s>
<s> well the problem is not my partition software but the hdd while formatting and creating the partitions for it i received an error that the process couldn t be completed and then it stopped being recognized by the pc </s>
<s> everytime i connect the hdd i receive a message saying that the usb driver could not be installed however it was working before i made the format and partition processes </s>
<s> runs from cd i wouldn t get such a message from that </s>
<s> are you sure you tried gparted </s>
<s> it s fairly simple as it has a mouse interface and well it s what i would use next </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ll try that and post my results </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
