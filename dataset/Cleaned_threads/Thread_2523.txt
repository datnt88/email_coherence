<s> dell dimension 4400 xphome p4 c wd1200jb d cd rw e st340016a i did something really stupid </s>
<s> i overwrote the st or e drive with 1 s and 0 s </s>
<s> this wiped out the drive including the mbr section </s>
<s> this was the original drive that came with the unit </s>
<s> my wd drive is my primary drive </s>
<s> howvever it has bad sectors </s>
<s> device manager and bios boot recognize my st drive </s>
<s> my computer doesn t show the e drive </s>
<s> but i haven t figured out how to write a mbr or anything else to the drive </s>
<s> i tried using seatools </s>
<s> but the program stops when it tells you that it doesn t work in windows but dos only </s>
<s> i have to turn off the computer and reboot to do anything </s>
<s> so what do i need to do to be able to use my st drive </s>
<s> boot to the seatools disk to test for damage on the 40gb seagate drive </s>
<s> in the meantime i d use the dell windows xp restoration disc to install windows on the 120gb hd </s>
<s> the windows xp installation cd will install all the necessary files to the mbr </s>
<s> make sure you install all drivers after installing windows download the latest versions from dell com </s>
<s> it s entirely proper for it to not show up in explorer until you partition and format it with your os </s>
<s> in xp you use the disk management tool </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for the suggestions </s>
<s> i hoped i followed the advice correctly </s>
<s> i used disk management to initialize my secondary drive </s>
<s> this time my computer recognized the e drive </s>
<s> however two days after i did this </s>
<s> i got the bsod message unmountable_boot_volume </s>
<s> i was able to access the recovery console </s>
<s> when i ran chkdsk after 21 a messaged appeared that i have one or more unrecoverable hard drive sections </s>
<s> so here is my question </s>
<s> is it possible to bring up the system and access the data so that it can be put on my new computer </s>
<s> my xp files are on my primary drive </s>
<s> i usually look to my backup disks </s>
<s> for me that s all of 4 dvdrw disks </s>
<s> that cost was all of 4 bucks and worth every penny </s>
<s> i don t backup the os or programs but reload those from cd or net </s>
<s> gt try this </s>
<s> put it in some usb external case and see if some other machine sees the files </s>
<s> sorry to hear your troubles are continuing </s>
<s> can you tell me if you connected it with the usual 80 conductor ide cable with the jumpers on cable select </s>
<s> i e </s>
<s> the normal setup for hard drives </s>
<s> bob </s>
