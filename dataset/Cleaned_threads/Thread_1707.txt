<s> i have using the following configured system currently </s>
<s> 1 gb dynet ram 500gb seagate hdd intel duel core processer inter dg31pr motherboard and galaxy gs8400 graphics card </s>
<s> following issues i am getting frequently 1 </s>
<s> look for a techky friend and don t use that repair shop anymore </s>
<s> you need a new harddrive or did they put a new one in </s>
<s> try solving one problem at a time </s>
<s> sometime it might be cheaper just to get another computer </s>
<s> you have a floppy drive </s>
<s> if yes try booting up the computer in dos </s>
<s> this way you will bypass the harddrive </s>
<s> that s how i do it when i check out a new computer </s>
<s> computers are very complicated when you don t know what you are doing but it s very simple when you do </s>
<s> if data is critial then back up now or asap in order to be safe with that </s>
<s> next any noise its best to follow your ear and check it out </s>
<s> you say its the hd but if it was causing that much noise it would fail </s>
<s> if not the hd it maybe simply vibration or resonance of metal when hd is accessing </s>
<s> most minor noise is from hd but it should be very slight </s>
<s> systems freeze for various reasons and if you re intense on pc usage just give it some more time as you didn t state when it freezes during what process like photo editing or such what task is being done that seems to cause a freeze </s>
<s> a possible cause of noise is the fan s within the system </s>
<s> again check operation that may allow fan to seize etc </s>
<s> for it kicks in into a higher rpm in order to cool the system </s>
<s> what about fan on video card check it out </s>
<s> are there other fans in case as well </s>
<s> clean the ram slots with alcohol and toothbrush or similar and allow to dry out retry afterwards and check results </s>
<s> review what you come across and report back </s>
