<s> looking to buy a 500 gb usb external hard drive </s>
<s> nothing fancy just want something reliable </s>
<s> any experience with a good one </s>
<s> thanks in advance gabe quashnofsky </s>
<s> seagate internal hard drive and put into a usb 2 case </s>
<s> i have two simpletech external drives that have run without a glitch for over a year or more </s>
<s> one sits on my work desk the other i carry around in my day bag with my laptop </s>
<s> i just bought one for 60 </s>
<s> although i am not a usb fan but i just couldn t let it pass at this price hehe </s>
<s> it seems to have good speed </s>
<s> i recommend that you do not buy seagate maxtor </s>
<s> i bought a 500 gb and now that i want to buy a new computer i have found out that it will not work with vista 64 bit </s>
<s> nothing on box says this </s>
<s> says it is compatible with vista </s>
<s> they should of said vista 32 but they did not </s>
<s> no plans for new drivers either </s>
<s> just be sure that whatever brand you buy it specifies vista 64 bit as this is the os that will soon be the norm and 32 bit will be out </s>
