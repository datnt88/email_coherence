<s> i have a pc using windows xp and a radeon x1950 graphic card and have purchased a vga cable to connect to my tv </s>
<s> i have plugged the cable in but am not sure what else if anything i need to do </s>
<s> please can anybody walk me through at novice level as to what i should be doing </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
<s> switch it to vga mode </s>
<s> what happen </s>
<s> some video card needs to be set to tv mode </s>
<s> what does the manual tell you </s>
<s> hi thanks for your reply which manual tv or pc </s>
<s> i d say he means the manual of the video card </s>
<s> but it seems a rather good idea to read the tv manual also </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i do not have the manual to the video card hence the request for a walk through at novice level </s>
<s> excerpt from what s in the box radeon x1950 xtx graphics card set up cd composite and s video cables hdtv out cable dvi to vga adapters manuals display support dvi i connectors for high resolution digital displays xilleon tv encoder for analog output yprpb component output for direct drive of hdtv displays vga mode support on all outputs tv out sdtv analog 480i 525i hdtv analog or digital 480p 720p 1080i any custom resolution so the manual should have been in the box </s>
<s> luckily most often they put a pdf version on the install cd also </s>
<s> have a look </s>
<s> with all these possibilities and cables included you should be able to make at least one match with your tv whatever it is </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i didn t install this graphics card nor inherit the manual and installation cd </s>
<s> as i mentioned novice level is required please can anybody explain what i need to do </s>
<s> find the right cable the right connector on your tv the right connector on your card and the right settings on both devices </s>
<s> that s all </s>
<s> without manuals and cd s it s somewhat more difficult than if you should have them </s>
<s> the basic rule try using the same connector on both ends be it analog hdmi scart dvi or composite video </s>
<s> sorry to be of no more help </s>
<s> if you can t find out take your pc and the manual of your tv with you to the shop and ask them for the right cable </s>
<s> that might be a good start </s>
<s> then explore the settings of your video card </s>
<s> kees </s>
