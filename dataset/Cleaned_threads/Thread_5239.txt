<s> i plan on upgrading my 4 year old enpower desktop and i would like to know if there is any way to copy everything from my old pc to the new pc so i can avoid having to re install all my programs and network software </s>
<s> i plan on staying with windows xp pro </s>
<s> i have a very small business and i use my desktop as a server with two other computers in the building as workstations </s>
<s> 1 copy the drive with something like g4u s copydisk see google for items like this in my post and then look up xp repair install to repair the os </s>
<s> 2 use alohabob </s>
<s> read bob </s>
<s> but it will not move installed software </s>
<s> well sort of but it s not a good idea </s>
<s> you could simply pull out the old hard drive and put it in the new machine and boot from that </s>
<s> this will work but it s not a good idea because your installation of xp is set up for your old machine </s>
<s> xp is actually smart enough to cope with this barely it s pretty good at installing all the new drivers for your motherboard etc but the old drivers and stuff tend to hang around </s>
<s> basically you ll end up with a wounded operating system and may have more serious problems too </s>
<s> you re really better off rebuilding the whole lot as you ll have a more stable setup in the long run </s>
<s> not a great idea </s>
<s> youll have driver conflit issues and is better to just reformat </s>
<s> you could buy a new harddrive and have your old set as a slave or 2nd sata driver to keep the files running at hand </s>
