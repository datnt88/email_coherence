<s> i heard that if one is using core duo or core 2 duo series processors or not using the new core i 3 5 etc processors an external hdd of 1 tb or above might not work properly </s>
<s> i mean they say it would be slow or it might not be compatible etc etc </s>
<s> so in short i am using windows 7 ultimate 2 gb or ram 2 2 gigs of core 2 duo processor on hp dv 6500 special edition and i am planning to buy wd my passport essential se 1 tb so would have i any issues or would it be ok </s>
<s> or may be i should just buy the my passport essential 500 gb </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> and who are they </s>
<s> some self proclaimed computer geeks </s>
<s> seriously they made it difficult for me make this simple choice </s>
<s> i ll keep this contained to my personal experiences </s>
<s> i have more than one 1 5tb usb drive as i maintain backups and beyond those i have other backups on dvd usb memory sticks and more </s>
<s> the machines the 1 5tb usb drives are used on are a collection of machines at the office with vista 7 with amd dual core core duo core 2 duo and i5 cpus </s>
<s> it all works so i d wonder why anyone would write it doesn t </s>

<s> the myth started a few years ago </s>
<s> manufacturer vendors sold external cases that specifically stated 500gb </s>
<s> some were 1 terrabyte </s>
<s> the end user did not either read the specification or failed to verify at the manufacturer s site the information </s>
<s> to this day there are vendor s that market external cases with only 1 terrabyte specs </s>
<s> today the most well known online vendors do an adequate job with specifications </s>
<s> links to the manufacturer s site and buyer reviews can sometimes answer lingering questions </s>
<s> start at then at the bottom read the next link to find where these barriers began and were overcome </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> vendors have been rating their external cases in gb s </s>
<s> some cases only handle 500gb some 1000gb some two 1000gb as twins </s>
<s> the problem rests with the interface within the external case </s>
<s> your link was about motherboard bios </s>
<s> apply if we boot from the usb drive as well as apply to the os </s>
<s> if it is unacceptable to note such details just say so and if this is your discussion i ll remove the offending content </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well that seems a little odd since i use a 1 5 tb drive against a core 2 system no issues </s>
<s> i wonder where they got their information </s>
<s> ok keeping aside the tech savvy talk can someone please reconfirm me that there wouldnt be any problem with a 1 1 5 tb external hd with intel core 2 dou hp win 7 </s>
<s> yes the 1t or 1 5t will work </s>
