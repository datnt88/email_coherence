<s> with dsd 150 already connected </s>
<s> are laptops still protected when away from the network </s>
<s> or how do i run a separate antivirus for the laptops when away from secure spot </s>
<s> there was some that thought that while you were on a lan you didn t need av or firewalls </s>
<s> sadly this is not true with windows machines </s>
<s> gt since such is free why would we go without protection </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so then how do i run an antivirus software for a laptop when it is detatched from the safespot network at home </s>
<s> tell us exactly why you think you have antivirus protection only when on your own network </s>
<s> you re the first poster i ve ever seen make a claim the home network is a quot safespot quot bob </s>
<s> this adapter i am talking about is a total network security device </s>
<s> its attatched between the modem and router </s>
<s> it secures the network </s>
<s> my network is a desktop two laptops and a itouch </s>
<s> i am wondering if the laptops and or the itouch is used away from the s link device how do i run an antivirus on these portable computers if its possible </s>
<s> i am assuming i can disable the antivirus when i m connected to the network and enable the antivirus when i m away </s>
<s> is this posible </s>
<s> note that gt the firewall protection is only applicable if the computers are connected to the internet through that device </s>
<s> otherwise you re not protected </s>
<s> gt the antivirus protection from mcafee must be installed on each computer </s>
<s> that will work even when your computers are not connected to that device </s>
<s> gt you should never disable your antivirus protection even when connected to that device </s>
<s> gt you should always use a firewall you need to install a software firewall for use when you re away from the d link device </s>
