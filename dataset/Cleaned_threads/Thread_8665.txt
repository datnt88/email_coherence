<s> i gave my old computr to my son when i bought a new system </s>
<s> the problem is he has started playing the online game runescape but he say s it is always lagging and runs too slow when i gave him the pc i reformatted so he was left with a clean computer well cleanish ive run antivirus anti spyware well everything really i wanted to know if it was worth me upgrading components or just putting up with me having to go on the old pc when he wants to play games </s>
<s> here is as much detail as i could find </s>
<s> 500mb ram 80 hard drive processor via samual 2 796 mhz </s>
<s> system model pvcle 266 syst type x86 based pc bios version american megatrends inc vers 07 00t smbios version 2 3 the sound and video cards are itegrated </s>
<s> ps </s>
<s> the motherboard is mercury </s>
<s> while it s light on power consumption i have to write it s not suitable for games </s>
<s> even if i were to install a 3d card this cpu is not about games but for running at very low wattage </s>
<s> sorry but it is what it is </s>
<s> don t upgrade it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> will adding extra ram help at all </s>
<s> it s still too little for today s games </s>
<s> i had hoped to save you from what could be a frustrating exercise </s>
<s> again i find it a great low power consumption machine for a low speed file server but gaming is not in it s future </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks much appreciated </s>
<s> just thought it might speed it up a little to get him off my pc </s>
<s> the onboard solution is too slow for games </s>
<s> if you can find any 3d card like a fx5200 or better that s a swift kick in the graphics area </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> again thanks for your help much appreciated </s>
<s> me again bob i found a video card obviously not purchased yet it is the nvidia geforce fx 5200 ddr 128mb agp vo i just wanted to know since you have the same system will it be compatible i tried to find out with google but could not find an answer </s>
<s> ps i saw something about you need to be agp compatable </s>
<s> is that the screen power connection </s>
<s> some do and some don t have agp </s>
<s> for the ones that didn t have agp you have to search for pci cards </s>
<s> use google com to research what these slot types look like if you need to </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi again i downloaded the motherboard manual and it said there are 2 pci slots for pci 2 2 1 vgaport and 1 internal agp 4x so does that mean i can use either or just the empty pci slots </s>
<s> you use those </s>
<s> newegg has some pci fx5200 cards or better such as my kid played most games on his 5500 although it was agp bob </s>
<s> last question i hope bob in the manual it says 2x 32 bit slots do i have to have 2x 32 bit or one 64 0r doesn t the bit size matter because all i have seen is the 128 bit </s>
<s> unless it s built by the nsa for some dark project your slots are good old pci bob </s>
<s> thanks again will give it a go and tell you if i have my pc back off my son </s>
