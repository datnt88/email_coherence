<s> how important is the performance of your computer s video card </s>
<s> it s one of the most important hardware components of my system </s>
<s> why is that </s>
<s> very important </s>
<s> why is that </s>
<s> somewhat important </s>
<s> why is that </s>
<s> not important at all </s>
<s> why not </s>
<s> i don t understand the importance of my computer s video card </s>
<s> i m not a gamer and i don t even usually watch videos on my multimedia pc so video performance is good to have but hardly essential for me </s>
<s> it s a lot more important on my notebook on which i do occasionally watch dvds when traveling </s>
<s> but even then it s a lot less important than cpu speed ram and hdd capacity </s>
<s> i like to edit video and especially with hdv i have to have a decent video card i have an older pc 1 8 ghz and couldn t even begin to edit hdv without it it also gives me a much needed second monitor </s>
<s> really the entire question is somewhat meaningless unless you specify what the computer is being used for </s>
<s> gamers need the fastest most powerful card available </s>
<s> servers need only minimal capabilities </s>
<s> most people can get by very well with the video built into the motherboard or fairly low end boards </s>
<s> i do a little video editing and some fairly sophisticated perl and java animations of my own designs and do these with the built in video card on my 2gb athlon x2 system </s>
<s> i suspect but don t really know that the performance of both would be enhanced by a little better video card </s>
<s> at heavy loads the pc did not quite keep up with the animations till i added the second gb of memory and i am thinking to go to even more sophisticated animations in the future </s>
<s> it s hard for me to understand why anyone except an extreme gamer would need more than a 100 video adapter </s>
<s> this is somewhat of a silly question because the results of this poll don t prove anything given that the quot computer quot isn t defined as to its kind or usage </s>
<s> for a desktop pc being used to play video games view and edit digital video etc most people would want the most powerful graphics card they could afford </s>
<s> for a desktop pc being used to run business applications a low end graphics card or even an integrated graphics chipset would suffice </s>
<s> and of course for a laptop integrated chipset graphics are the way to go </s>
<s> high end graphics cards use a lot of power and generate a lot of heat which would result in poor battery life loud fan noise and possible discomfort to the user </s>
<s> most people want a laptop primarily to run business applications and would prefer long battery life and lower heat dissipation </s>
<s> that is why the best quality laptops usually have very basic graphics capabilities </s>
<s> it s one of the most important hardware components of my system because we can only see what is on our monitor not which electron is going where inside our cpu </s>
<s> the question ask how important is quot your quot video card and not quot the quot video card </s>
<s> this automatically implies that it s for your purposes and not just general ones </s>
<s> sorry couldn t resist throwing a bart simpson quip with the use of double negative </s>
<s> i was surprised that my answer was not listed as an actual option on the polls above </s>
<s> a request to the cnet administrators when you put the poll in the forums for discussions please also include the link to the actual poll </s>
<s> i chose to receive plain text newsletters and i can t actually exercise my vote anywhere because the link is not provided either in the newsletter or here </s>
<s> and will suffice with integrated </s>
<s> graphics cards are important for gamers and if you work with graphics modelling 3d animation for a living </s>
<s> no really thanks </s>
<s> i dissect media headlines all the time </s>
<s> i think you have to specify what the laptop or desktop computer will be used for </s>
<s> if you are going to use it for multimedia or games obviously a video card with more power is necessary </s>
<s> now if youre just after the browsing you can settle for less </s>
<s> i voted somewhat important </s>
<s> i don t play games or edit video so i don t need the fastest thing out there </s>
<s> i like to watch movies on my pc so i need something a little faster than the cheapest </s>
<s> and i don t like the video using my ram either </s>
<s> so i spend about 50 00 and for the most part i have been happy with what i get </s>
