<s> hey i have a laptop with a d sub vga out </s>
<s> and the max resolution on my laptop is 1280x800 </s>
<s> i m looking into getting a new tv and most of the ones i m looking at have a d sub in </s>
<s> so i m wondering what the limitations of vga are </s>
<s> will i get the full 1280x800 resolution on the tv via vga connection </s>
<s> also this is more of tv question but incase anyone knows since 720p tv s are 1080x720 and my laptop is 1280x800 would i get the best picture by setting the tv to 720p or 1080p </s>
<s> i would assume that if the computer did the actuall 1080x720p that would be best since there wouldn t need to be any scaling what so ever but since it doesn t match up would it still be better to set to 720p becaue is closer or to 1080p </s>
<s> that blu ray player software are not supposed to display over that interface </s>
<s> of if it does only at 480p as to 720 etc </s>
<s> windows 7 has been very nice about detecting the video capabilities </s>
<s> i would do nothing until i plug it in </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> to match up as you put it </s>
<s> you should have no problem with your computer display sittings </s>
<s> leave the tv at its normal sitting what ever that might be 720 or 1080 depends on the tv you are going to get </s>
