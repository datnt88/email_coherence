<s> my wife s computer s hard drive died </s>
<s> i tried installing both ide and sata drives to use for the restore </s>
<s> none of them are recognized by the disk management system on the restore cd </s>
<s> the bios shows the hdd </s>
<s> i partitioned and formatted the new sata hdd on my computer and reinstalled it on the wife s computer </s>
<s> i have changed all of the hhd settings shown in the bios i e </s>
<s> achi ide and native legacy </s>
<s> the motherboard is intel i think it is dg33fb but i cannot find the model number </s>
<s> the defective hhd was a 320 gb seagate </s>
<s> the new hdd is a western digital 500 gb </s>
<s> the cd that came with the wd is supposed to be bootable but it will not boot </s>
<s> i tried asking microsoft but they claim it is a hardware problem </s>
<s> i am at a loss as what to do </s>
<s> help please </s>
<s> cd dvd drives loose boot capability but work fine in windows so no surprise to me just those that encounter it the first and about the first ten times </s>
<s> microsoft is right to not support this but it is annoying </s>
<s> let s not ask them to support booting a wd cd </s>
<s> gt try disabling ahci mode </s>
<s> without a driver diskette the famous f6 floppy you find at google xp has no clue what sata is </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sata wasn t offered when xp came out </s>
<s> thus you need the driver provided by the hd maker </s>
<s> visit the wd support website and get it or check your wd cd and see if its there </s>
<s> if so expand it and make a bootable floppy usually or access by another bootable means </s>
<s> thus when you use your restore cd when it asks quot outside drivers needed required quot or similar wording during the xp install </s>
<s> a restore cd should offer small menu to supply whatever to continue the install process </s>
<s> fyi the making of xp install on another system just won t work when swapped to the end system </s>
<s> on top of the sata issue you will have a xp blank screen or blinking cursor as a result </s>
<s> review the bios setting so sata is active and or both sata eide if you plan to use eide too </s>
<s> you will need also to make the boot order if sata is going to be the primary boot device enable it </s>
<s> you may need to play with it for best results as it varies from bios to bios and mtrbds </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> wd will not supply a driver for your computer or the drive </s>
<s> sata is part of the motherboard and the driver is from that maker </s>
