<s> jumpered as slave </s>
<s> i can t get the hard drive to recognize in the bios to install the operating system </s>
<s> i can use all of the help that i can get </s>
<s> thanks for the patience and help laraine </s>
<s> how about jumpering the drive as master and seeing if you can get it recognized by itself </s>
<s> check out how the first hard drive or cd is jumpered in some cases they use cs instead of master and in that case both drives should be jumpered cs </s>
<s> hey thanks for the suggestion </s>
<s> i am at work now and i was thinking of the same thing myself </s>
<s> my biggest problem is the fact that i can t get the cmos to recognize the drive </s>
<s> i am installing windows xp home </s>
<s> can i use a windows 98 se start up disk to fdisk the drive after i get the drive recognized </s>
<s> or will the cd rom be automatically recognized to fdisk the drive </s>
<s> thanks again for the help </s>
<s> laraine </s>
<s> well your post is kind of confusing </s>
<s> are you saying you can t boot from the floppy </s>
<s> that is a separate issue </s>
<s> re hard drive it is possible that your bios needs to be flashed updated in order to recognize the new drive </s>
<s> re check your cables make sure they re inserted the right way </s>
<s> it is easy to reverse them </s>
<s> tell us the size of the new drive fj </s>
<s> hey the new hard drive is 40 gb </s>
<s> i am really just needing to put the hard drive in my gateway computer with a 700 mhz cpu and 256 mb memory to install the operating system for a friend </s>
<s> i am at work now but i am getting ready to go home to work on the drive </s>
<s> i am going to master the drive and try to install the operating system that way </s>
<s> i do need to know if the windows xp home disk has fdisk on it </s>
<s> thanks again laraine </s>
<s> i want to thank you all for the help </s>
<s> i come home from work set the hard drive up as master and i am now in the process of installing windows xp </s>
<s> i hate it when someone drops things in my lap </s>
<s> i just had to do some thinking </s>
<s> thanks again for the help laraine </s>
