<s> i got a new sd card a while ago for my camera </s>
<s> the built in card reader in my epson printer displays a picture of a memory card with a zig zag line across it implying that the card is corrupted </s>
<s> however i can view the pictures on the camera and can transfer normally to the computer using a usb to the camera </s>
<s> however the card reader is much more convenient </s>
<s> i have formatted the card using the camera s function and that did nothing </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> some printers had limitations </s>
<s> it s 4gb and i have tested it with only one photo on it so it s not like there is a huge amount of data on it </s>
<s> it has slots for 6 different types of card and i have previously used it with a memory duo pro or whatever that long sony one is called successfully </s>
<s> the printer is only a couple of years old </s>
<s> it is an epson stylus photo rx520 which is similar to the rx500 </s>
<s> high capacity </s>
<s> you are lucky your camera supports this </s>
<s> you might have had better luck with the 2gb which is just sd and not sdhc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i didn t think about that </s>
<s> thanks </s>
