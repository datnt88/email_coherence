<s> hey guys i just connected my dell xps 400 running windows xp to my panasonic th c42fd18 plasma </s>
<s> the only problem im having is that the screen size on the tv is too big how do i fix the resolution </s>
<s> by the way im running dual monitors both are displaying the same thing the picture on the computer moniter is fine but the tv is too stretched out and doesnt fit </s>
<s> and how do i get sound to come out of the television speakers if im using a dvi hdmi connection </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> well almost </s>
<s> if sound is coming from the pc speakers then it s set wrong </s>
<s> try under playback devices control panel sound chang default from speakers to hdmi audio </s>
<s> as to the screen sizes that s all about video mode settings </s>
<s> i can not offer any exact answer </s>
<s> but you should try other video modes </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> first you ll have to decide if you want your display cloned both monitor and tv display the same image or your desktop expanded to two monitors </s>
<s> the steps to do this are somewhat dependent on your graphics card which you didn t mention </s>
<s> also you should set the pc to use either a 1920x1080 recommended or 1280x720 resolution for the tv </s>
<s> lastly you won t get sound over dvi </s>
<s> you ll need to use a 3 5mm stereo cable like this to connect your pc s headphone speaker jack to the stereo input jack on the tv </s>
<s> to get your pc to run hdmi to your big screen you would need hdmi capability from pc not dvi crossover adapter and an hdmi cable of course </s>
<s> so no problem here </s>
<s> your video card might not have a high enough resolution to support the tv </s>
<s> to get sound to come out of the tv speakers there should be an audio out connector on your computer s sound card and an audio in connector on the tv just hook them up </s>
