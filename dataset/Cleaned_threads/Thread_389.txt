<s> i have an acer 3810t laptop and am running windows 7 on it </s>
<s> the problem i ve had is my wifi has been unstable </s>
<s> for example for 5 minutes or sometimes up to an hour i can easily find wifi networks in range of my laptop but then out of nowhere it disappears and i don t find any networks but any other wifi device will find my router so i know it s laptop related </s>
<s> i did some research on google and found out this is an issue others have had with windows 7 and it seems to be something to do with when updates are installed </s>
<s> i followed the advice to remove my wifi drivers and reinstall them so i downloaded a file for the intel drivers from acer s website </s>
<s> i went into control panel and removed 2 devices that were related to wifi </s>
<s> i then did a scan for hardware and found one wifi device an intel wifi link 5100agn </s>
<s> i installed the driver for this one </s>
<s> the problem is i know i removed two and this is the only one the scan found and i can t remember the name of the other wifi device driver i removed </s>
<s> unfortunately ever since i did this my wifi isn t working </s>
<s> in the control panel it shows all drivers are installed and working but when i click on the bars at the bottom of my screen no wifi networks show </s>
<s> i have tried going into the network and sharing center and for example i select set up a connection or network and when i select manually connect to a wireless network it states quot an unexpected error occured quot so i know something is missing that s allowing the wifi to work </s>
<s> i hope when i get it corrected it may solve the original issue i had but does anyone know how i can get this working once again </s>
<s> thank you for your help </s>
<s> use system restore to a date when it worked </s>
<s> as to windows updates the only time this has bothered any machine in the office when there was some malware installed </s>
<s> go figure why folk think it s the updates and not the pests </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no i didn t try system restore to a date when it worked but i m going to give that a try </s>
