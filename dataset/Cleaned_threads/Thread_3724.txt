<s> i noticed two ip addresses reserved with dchp on my home wireless </s>
<s> from ip addresses i can t seem to figure out who these belong to at home </s>
<s> all connected computers and devices are accounted for </s>
<s> could these possibly be someone s hacking to my wireless to connect to internet </s>
<s> or are these for modem setup etc </s>
<s> can anyone help please </s>
<s> i don t want to block them w o knowing if they are legitimate or not </s>
<s> thx </s>
<s> these are under your control so block away and if a printer stops you can change it back </s>
<s> and yes to your hack question </s>
<s> it could be something the person that set it up did but it s your network </s>
<s> control it or let others control it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you should be able to see the mac address associated with the ip </s>
<s> when i see a mac that i don t recognize i copy and paste into a site like this one </s>
<s> sometimes it doesn t return a straightforward result but it might give you a clue to which device it belongs </s>
<s> i also keep a list of all mac addresses for devices i own for future reference </s>
