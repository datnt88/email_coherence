<s> facts gtx 660ti vs radeon hd 7950 </s>
<s> meaning they swap places on what they each do better </s>
<s> if it was my call and i was going to spend 300 bucks i d go with the 7950 way better bandwidth </s>
<s> im using one monitor if that makes a difference </s>
<s> what role does bandwidth play over the 660ti </s>
<s> there is no price difference right now </s>
<s> i d head to google and type in tomshardware and then add the card in question then the word review </s>

<s> bob </s>
<s> that refers to how fast you can feed the card </s>
<s> for game play across multiple games this is important </s>
<s> for game play on a specific game perhaps not so much </s>
<s> search for reviews i think your going to find that overall the 7950 is the better card </s>
