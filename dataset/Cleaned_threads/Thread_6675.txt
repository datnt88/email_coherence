<s> i have usb to ps 2 converter recognized by vista but unable to install it without drivers </s>
<s> this converter supported by windows 98 se me 2000 xp </s>
<s> where can i get such drivers for vista </s>
<s> most usb mice at the moment come with a small converter to use them with a ps 2 port </s>
<s> those don t need a driver </s>
<s> i just plug them in </s>
<s> the other way around maybe </s>
<s> ps 2 keyboard or mouse in a usb port </s>
<s> what exactly is the make and model of your device </s>
<s> did you already check the makers site </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> ps 2 mouse keyboard input one usb output </s>
<s> windows 98 se me 2000 xp has a built in support in this kind of devices </s>
<s> so it came with no drivers </s>
<s> but vista just recognize it </s>
<s> so i need drivers to install it </s>
<s> one of those driver issues you run into when switching from xp to vista </s>
<s> even reputable companies like hp don t support older printers under vista so people have to replace a perfectly functioning one by a new one </s>
<s> i d say the outlook for generic devices like this is not too well </s>
<s> maybe somebody knows </s>
<s> otherwise back to the shop to ask about it </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> sometimes members will go driver hunting </s>
<s> gt but try this </s>
<s> turn off uac and try again </s>
<s> also you shall use an admin account </s>
<s> i ve been solving nutty issues this way </s>
<s> i will not explain microsoft s ways or why it matters </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if someone has ps 2 to usb converter on xp or vista </s>
<s> please let me know how to make it work </s>
<s> a quot company quot made the product </s>
<s> if there is no such company support then it s a dead end </s>
<s> i don t read where you tried it my way </s>
<s> why not try it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it goes something like quot vpro quot or quot ovpro quot or quot covpro quot some unclear logo it doesn t really matter </s>
<s> it recognized automatically by all windows except vista </s>
<s> i think that xp drivers would be good enough </s>
<s> did you turn off uac and as the administrator as i noted </s>
<s> also your post is too light on machine details </s>
<s> i can t count how many times i cure these issues with a flip of the legacy usb in the bios or by using the rear ports </s>
<s> but your posts are void of details so i can t look to see if those apply </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> usb legacy devices turned on i can use the keyboard via adapter to choose safe mode or normal mode </s>
<s> so the adapter working </s>
<s> i turned off uac restarted the computer </s>
<s> windows recogniozed the adapter but couldn t install it from internet or from the computer </s>
<s> in the device manager it s named quot ps2 to usb converter quot with yellow exclamation mark </s>
<s> in the properties under general tab quot a driver service for this device has been disabled </s>
<s> an alternate driver may be providing this functionality </s>
<s> code 32 click check for solutions to send data about this device to microsoft and to see if there is a solution available quot driver tab driver provider quot unknown quot driver date quot not available quot driver version quot not available quot digital signer quot not digital signed quot when i press on quot check for solutions quot i get message to download quot update for windows vista 32 bit versions kb940199 quot </s>
<s> i downloaded it and nothing happened </s>
<s> finding it might be a big problem </s>
<s> apparently microsoft left it out of vista deliberately and the rather unknown manufacturer might not have enough reason or resources to write one </s>
<s> the best thing to do might be to contact microsoft </s>
<s> they are doing their utmost best to make vista as compatible with older os es as possible there are still much too much people who don t want vista for reasons like this and they might be able to help you </s>
<s> best of luck and let us know </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i have to try it both ways </s>
<s> but as we found out with the apple laserwriters microsoft left out some drivers that were native included with xp but are not in vista </s>
<s> try a brand name product with support for vista </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> again thanks for trying that </s>
<s> sorry it didn t work but thank you 3 times for getting that done </s>
<s> i can t count how many times we go 20 posts and wind up with finally trying something from post 2 bob </s>
<s> the adapter was installed immediately </s>
<s> so now everything works fine </s>
<s> sp1 rc even solved another problem with drivers of my cell phone sony ericsson z610i </s>
<s> i happy that microsoft released sp1 rc now </s>
<s> thanks to everyone how tried to help </s>
<s> you just added a nugget to the collective knowledge that microsoft slipped in some drivers on that sp1 </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am having hcl make leaptop model p3831 i like to connect external key board by use of usb to ps 2 converter but it was not connecting it asking driver can u help where should i get the driver software </s>
<s> anyway you might want to migrate to windows 7 if you can because vista does have many problems </s>
