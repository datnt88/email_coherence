<s> i have recently moved to a new apartment prior to moving i could run the video game i play primarily at all very high settings and get a static 75fps </s>
<s> now i get 30 or less than that and i m on low settings </s>
<s> the conditions of the transport of my pc were as follows wedged between back seat on ground stable my ac was on full blast and the windows were foggy upon leaving vehicle was around a 30 minute drive </s>
<s> could the moisture of the ac have potentially shorted something </s>
<s> i ve ran chkdsk no bad sectors </s>
<s> ran prime95 for processor and memtest for ram </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i m very frustrated </s>
<s> any suggestions would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> you need to take nothing for granted </s>
<s> i thought that any car a c will cause damage and if it did just wouldn t work if that severe </s>
<s> you re going to have to check it out top to bottom and verify all is well </s>
<s> clean it out reseat components etc fan s operation and same type of location as before </s>
<s> doing all that helps eliminate or resolve your problem </s>
<s> it s not the same anymore no matter how you want to view this you moved it and relocated to different area </s>
<s> sorry no easy replace or do this or that </s>
<s> once all of the above is done then look at possible damage </s>
<s> overall i don t see that for now </s>
<s> you may need to do a total teardown and rebuild to best ideal conditions </s>
<s> fyi i ve seen pcs moved but didn t work at yours </s>
<s> one case involved that the user sat the pc next to the door for over a week </s>
<s> moved and then issues </s>
<s> upon teardown found a mouse had visited the pc and chewed some harness and peed inside stains thought the pc booted and all it never was the same </s>
<s> another had roaches move in </s>
<s> so don t take things for granted whatever your cause is </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks alot for your input </s>
<s> this is what i had feared haha </s>
<s> i have to do actual physical work nooooooooo </s>
<s> haha </s>
<s> just kidding </s>
