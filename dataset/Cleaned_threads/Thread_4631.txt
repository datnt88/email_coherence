<s> anyone using green drives here </s>
<s> what are the benefits </s>
<s> please share your experience </s>
<s> feel free to post your comments suggestions as well </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i ve never used a green drive but from my understanding all it is is that it uses less power hence quot green quot to lower you re carbon footprint </s>
<s> everything else works the same just the drive uses less power </s>
<s> generally the ones i ve seen with this feature have a shorter warranty </s>
<s> i don t know if this relates to quality standards that are relaxed in these or not </s>
<s> but a drive that breaks and goes to the dump earlier than one that does not loses some quot green quot appeal or so i d think </s>
<s> it takes energy to make the drive as well </s>
<s> it s only quot greener quot if the overall consumption of energy from manufacturing to disposal is less than one without that label </s>
<s> but earlier disposal can mean additional environmental impact and this makes it s quot greenness quot difficult to qualify </s>
