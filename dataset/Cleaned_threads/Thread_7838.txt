<s> i live in egypt and i intend to make my home the first wireless wi fi network to be in egypt my situation is 1 we live in buildings made of brick and i intend to make the connection between me and a couple of my friends in the opposite building which is about 60 meters away </s>
<s> does the signal will pass through brick </s>
<s> 2 in winter we have a rainy weather does it will affect the signal between us </s>
<s> 3 my isp uses alcatel modems or router what is the router that will support working with such modems </s>
<s> i have read on the internet that d link xtremeg and netgear 108mbps don t function properly with alcatel dsl modems for some new sensors in the ports of both d link and netgear routers </s>
<s> 4 my isp will provide me with an adsl connection not a dsl one so what is the dsl router that will support this </s>
<s> see i have a 4 point situation and the router i am looking for should meet these points i guess so could you help me please find such router please </s>
<s> a very important point is that the wireless routers is very new thing that isn t sold in the stores in egypt so i have to buy from the us and the same time supporting requirments here for adsl connections this is my biggest confusion is buying a router from the us fitting the requirments in egypt but these requirments are summerized in my 4 points specialy the last 2 points they are the most important that we can t miss by the way i was thinking of buffalo airstation g 54 and microsoft mn 700 i know there are many differences between them as i read thier detailed reviews but does anyone of them can meet my 4 points specially the adsl connection and the alcatel routers support </s>
<s> because these 2 things i can t avoid </s>
<s> i hope to hear from you so soon and many thanks in advance for helping me </s>
<s> even without such the signal barely works well at tens of meters in a drywall and wood house </s>
<s> rain and concrete absorb the signal and you need to add range extenders such as and antennas such as the cantenna look it up on google com </s>
<s> what is worth writing is that the equipment is cheaper than having someone quot design quot and test out a possible solution so place the wap or wifi route on the dsl cable modem add extenders where needed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> mourad a couple of thoughts on your requirements 1 the radio signals will pass through brick but the density of the material will weaken the signal more than if the walls were wood </s>
<s> distance also affects signal strength </s>
<s> 65 meters is about as far as you can expect under good circumstances but the signal will likely be very weak at your friends place across the road </s>
<s> if you want to boost the reception you ll need to work with external antennas or other hacks to the radio chips in the router </s>
<s> there are lots of websites about building your own parabolic reflectors or alternative antennas from tin cans which will increase the distance to 1 000 meters or more </s>
<s> there are also special devices and firmware hacks that boost the radio output strength but these are usually specific to a particular brand or model of wifi unit </s>
<s> 2 i don t know how rain affects things the concept is designed for indoor use and the effects in an outdoor environment are not as well documented </s>
<s> trees and leaves interfere with the signal while wood walls which are made from trees don t because of the water in the living tree </s>
<s> possibly rain does too </s>
<s> 3 i like the buffalo equipment </s>
<s> i would stay away from the microsoft equipment </s>
<s> it s not that the ms equipment is bad but my sense is that microsoft is not as committed to its hardware business so i don t know what the long term support for the product will turn out to be </s>
<s> 4 adsl or full sdsl that doesn t matter to the router </s>
<s> that is handled by the modem </s>
<s> the router only needs an ethernet connection to the modem </s>
<s> you ve already looked at the issue of compatibility between the ethernet ports of the alcatel vs some d link and netgear equipment </s>
<s> one more consideration that i don t know the answer to government regulation of the radio spectrum </s>
<s> in the usa equipment the 2 4ghz radio band is divided into specific frequency channels that are different from the frequency channels required by the european government regulations </s>
<s> there are probably different frequency assignments in other countries </s>
<s> that is why the technical documentation always specifies that a particular wifi product is intended for sale use only in a certain country or region of the world </s>
<s> you mention that yours will be the first wifi computer network in your area but there may be other incompatible uses of the 2 4ghz radio band in your country that will cause interference on your link or worse your computer equipment will cause disruption to other radio equipment near you </s>
<s> typical uses of the 2 4ghz radio band are microwave ovens cordless telephones and quot walkie talkie quot personal radio communications </s>
<s> be careful about what your government thinks about your use of the radio frequencies of the wifi equipment you buy </s>
