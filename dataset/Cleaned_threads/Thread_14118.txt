<s> yesterday i decided to clean out the dust inside my desktop so i removed the ram video card and 2 fans that s it </s>
<s> after cleaning it out i put it all back in </s>
<s> plugged everything in and powered on my computer </s>
<s> the computer makes the sounds it normally does when it s powered on but the monitor had an orange light meaning there is power to the monitor but it isn t connected to a computer </s>
<s> yes i made sure the monitor was hooked in well not loose or anything i ve checked and am pretty sure the video card is in properly </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> i hope it s something obvious i might have missed </s>
<s> make sure the graphics card is seated firmly and screwed in </s>
<s> make sure any power connectors that went to the card are plugged back in 6 pin 8 pin this often doesn t apply unless its a powerful card make sure the ram is in the same slots you took it out of </s>
<s> don t ask me why motherboards are weird like that </s>
<s> try powering on with only one stick of ram try the other stick if it still doesn t work </s>
<s> make sure the power supply is plugged into everything it s supposed to be plugged into motherboard especially </s>
<s> if you removed the heatsink and cpu cooler double check you put it back on right </s>
<s> this is all i can really think of right now </s>
<s> i am leaning towards ram being your problem if the monitor is powering on </s>
<s> do you have a speaker installed for beep codes </s>
<s> the only thing i can think of that i did wrong is put the fan that sits over the cpu heatsink wrong never took the heatsink out but it s still sitting over it doing it s job i just twisted it one more space than was supposed to </s>
<s> the graphics card is out dated so no power connectors </s>
<s> i ll try with only 1 stick of ram and post again and post back in a few minutes </s>
<s> doing anything with the ram didn t work </s>
<s> i ran into this last week </s>
<s> the machine had onboard graphics as well as the vga card </s>
<s> i had to move the cable to the onboard to change the bios setting and then back to the card for the next boot </s>
<s> without make and model i can t tell if this applies or if that information would have me think of something else </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> test the monitor on another pc </s>
<s> pps </s>
<s> check both ends of the vga cable </s>
