<s> it has been a while since last i bought a new desktop computer </s>
<s> i have started researching and found there have been a lot of changes in technology since my last purchase </s>
<s> i am pretty well settled on an intel e6600 cpu with a gigabyte ga 965p ds4 motherboard </s>
<s> this board has pretty well everything i want already onboard except a graphics card </s>
<s> this is where i am bogging down in my search </s>
<s> i had intended to keep my nec 1800 lcd monitor and just upgrade the processor box </s>
<s> however now i am having second thoughts </s>
<s> the ga 965p ds4 motherboard has these newer pcie slots which to my understanding are a replacement for the older agp slots and cards </s>
<s> but i am not sure which pcie video card to get and i am not sure if they are available to feed my old analog lcd monitor or if they only come with a digital interface which will force me to also buy a new digital interfaced monitor </s>
<s> i am not a gamer but i do want one of the fastest systems for digital photo and video editing as well as running adobe s creative suite of applications i find that my current system just does not have the horsepower to drive these programs efficiently </s>
<s> i also want a system that will be ready for windows vista when it eventually ships my understanding is that it will need considerable horsepower and also a strong video card with pixel shading </s>
<s> so my question is what would be a good recommendation for a video card for my new system and do i need to get a digital monitor or is there a pcie card that has analog output </s>
<s> or should i go with a digital card and new monitor is there an advantage </s>
<s> btw i notice many of these newer video cards support dual monitors this is not a feature that i require and don t wish to pay extra for it </s>
<s> finally i would also appreciate some links to sites on video cards reviews recommendations etc </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> all new geforce radeon perform about the same for 2d apps such as adobe cs2 </s>
<s> any geforce 7300gt or radeon x1600pro will be more than sufficient </s>
<s> both are in the 90 price range from web shops and both will fully support vista when it arrives </s>
<s> also practically all new cards come with dual monitor and hdtv support </s>
<s> you re not paying extra for them since they re standard equipment nowadays </s>
<s> thanks for the reply i read up on it and it looks like the x1600 pro is just what i need and well within my budget </s>
<s> it also has both vga and dvi interfaces so i can use it now on my current lcd monitor and also later if i choose to upgrade to a digital monitor </s>
<s> btw it mentions crossfire ready what exactly is crossfire </s>
<s> is ati s name for when two graphics cards that can be linked together for more 3d power </s>
<s> please be aware that while the hardware reqired by m vista is not actually huge no graphics card on the market at the moment provides quot full support quot </s>
<s> vista will use directx10 and support directx9 and all graphics cards at the moment are only directx9 </s>
<s> geebee </s>
<s> thanks for the reply i guess it is just as well then that i am not shelling out big bucks for a graphics card the x1600 is only about 135 cad </s>
<s> and since i don t expect vista to be stable for another year i probably won t be migrating before then so i still think the x1600 will do for a while </s>
<s> thanks pl </s>
<s> vista s aero interface is built on dx9 not dx10 </s>
<s> ms chose to do this since dx9 is stable and they ve been working on aero for over 2 years </s>
<s> aero will be migrated to dx10 in a future vista release </s>
<s> any dx9 card with sm 3 0 and 128mb of ram will fully support vista aero </s>
<s> a site recently which detailed 2d speeds and while all the cards were stratospheric scorers it didn t look to have moved on much from the good old days </s>
<s> cards which wouldn t even score in the top 100 matrox 3dfx xgi videologic were even listed i think now for 3d speed were easily a match for more modern hardware if i found it interesting i d be able to find it again </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> apparently 2d speeds have been pretty much topped out i can t even find the link now but remeber matrox 550 was a good quot old quot scorer for many years with no drive for extra speeds so any card will be adequate for what you require </s>
<s> here s a link detailing the x1600pro and crossfire fully too </s>
<s> the only caveat the power required </s>
<s> it s not exactly a low power device so please make sure your psu can provide the current required </s>
<s> gb </s>
<s> that quot full support quot will not include vista s dx10 ramarc </s>
<s> no need to get so testy </s>
<s> gb </s>
<s> thanks again for all the advice </s>
<s> as i said i am not a gamer so it would appear the x1600 will do nicely for me and the price seems right </s>
<s> my only concern now is the motherboard i intended to use gigabyte ga 965p ds4 seems to be having problems </s>
<s> i just heard from my dealer that gigabyte recently recalled all these boards because of a design flaw in the chipset </s>
<s> who knows if the next release will be stable </s>
<s> gonna have to do some more research on this board </s>
<s> again thanks for all the advice for the video card </s>
<s> yes regarding power i just read power hungry graphics if there s one area of computer hardware that is getting a bit out of hand it s pc graphics </s>
<s> ati and nvidia are releasing newer and faster products at a breakneck pace single card sli powerhouses double wide ati crossfire behemoths nvidia s quad sli all seemingly designed with no heed to power consumption or heat production </s>
<s> if you think directx 10 will alleviate these concerns you re dead wrong the combined requirements of vista directx 10 and upcoming 3d games and applications will drive gpu technology through the ceiling </s>
<s> companies like thermaltake are even ramping up for this increased power draw by releasing dedicated gpu power supplies </s>
<s> these units range from 250 to 300 watts fit into an open 5 25 inch drive bay and supply power exclusively to the gpu </s>
<s> from these wattage specifications it s safe to assume that first generation directx 10 cards will be power hungry products indeed </s>
<s> heat production is another potential sore spot and all indications say that cooling will be a challenge for vista ready gpus </s>
<s> the only hope is that second generation or subsequent revisions will bring directx 10 products that get us back on track with a sane balance of high performance and energy savings much as nvidia has done with the evolution of its geforce 7600 and 7900 gpus </s>
<s> some folks will never use dx10 or game so little that a dx9 card will suffice them for years to come </s>
<s> there s just no need for them to think they ve got to get a dx10 card in order to use the full vista ui </s>
<s> power requirement indicated in the hardware review review the x1600 and modern graphics cards in general are a power hungry bunch </s>
<s> if you don t have the psu overhead to spare at the moment you re looking immediately at extra expense </s>
<s> or you could go for one of those older cards that still do well in 2d speeds and suck up far less power </s>
<s> there are a few modern cards which use less wattage though x bit seems to be one of the few tech sites that actually measures current draw which may help upgraders to avoid upseting a weaker psu </s>
<s> personally if the dx10 hardware coming in 2007 is going to be as bad as suspected i suspect the electricity to power them for a year we ve had 3 prices rises in 6 months may be more than the cost of the computers themselves </s>
