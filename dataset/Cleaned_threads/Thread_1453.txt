<s> hi i m immanuel here i m confused whether i m supposed to enable the s m a r t capability for the hard disk s i have i ve got a 80gb sata hard disk and a 160gb ide hard disk i use windows xp and a 915 intel chipset please help i don t want to spoil my hard disk because of a wrong setting </s>
<s> my thought is to always enable smart since you need the early warning </s>
<s> there are however some naysayers such as vendors on ebay that don t like this </s>
<s> in the last case they had resold a drive that failed smart so they had no interest in what it reported </s>
<s> you can take what you can from that event </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the sugession i got a reply in no time </s>
<s> you could turn it on or off </s>
<s> my tests with everest just show it ok </s>
