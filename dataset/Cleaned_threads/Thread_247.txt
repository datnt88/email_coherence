<s> hey everyone i am planning to buy a new external harddrive for everyday use like movies music pictures etc </s>
<s> i will be connecting it to my xbox mostly to watch movies </s>
<s> now i had western digital elements 1tb and it only lasted for a year </s>
<s> there are two types that am confused between the portable ones which are smaller in size and regular big ones </s>
<s> if you guys could tell me if there is any other difference than the obvious size difference </s>
<s> i know portable cost just a bit more </s>
<s> but is there any speed difference </s>
<s> also does big ones last longer than portables </s>
<s> also which one you guys recommend </s>
<s> i was looking to buy for under 150 </s>
<s> size 500 gb 1 tb </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> hi the basic differences between portable and non portable drives are the form factor of the disks they use and their power source </s>
<s> as you have observed portable drives are smaller and are usually powered directly off the usb port to which they are connected </s>
<s> non portable drives are bigger and are usually separately powered </s>
<s> portable drives are based on the 2 5 quot drive used in laptops and other not surprisingly portable computers </s>
<s> they tend to have a smaller capacity and usually but not always operate at a slower speed e g </s>
<s> 5400 rpm rather than 7200 non portable drives are based on the 3 5 quot drives normally used in desktop systems tend to have larger capacities up to 3 tb and operate at the faster desktop speeds typically 7200 rpm </s>
<s> but this extra weight and speed requires more power than can usually be supplied by a usb port and so they come with an external power source </s>
<s> the origin of the disks gives a clue as to the difference in portability </s>
<s> desktops are assumed not to move frequently at least not while powered on and so it was also assumed that the disks wouldn t suffer the accidental knocks and drops that would be associated with a portable device </s>
<s> the bigger platters and longer read write arms do flex more and are not as shock resistant as smaller devices </s>
<s> so a 3 5 quot non portable external drive should not be moved while powered on and dropping one is usually fatal </s>
<s> with the advent of laptops something more robust was required that could withstand the shock of a laptop being picked up and typically rotated through 90 degrees to be carried and unfortunately knocked or dropped on occasion </s>
<s> while you can carry a powered on laptop around it s always wisest to close the lid and put it in standby so the disk s have stopped spinning </s>
<s> enter the 2 5 quot drive its smaller physical size makes it inherently less susceptible to shock and the manufacturers have gone to some lengths to enhance this capability </s>
<s> basically it is assumed that they will be frequently moved around </s>
<s> i assume your xbox is relatively static and so that would suggest a non portable drive would suffice but where would you get the movies from </s>
<s> if you get them from your camcorder or pc and that means you need to move the external drive frequently you might want to consider a portable drive though within your house providing it isn t powered on when you move it a non portable drive should be ok you don t say why your wd failed after only a year that is unusual unless it s been shall we say not treated kindly </s>
<s> that might push you to a portable assuming the xbox usb ports have enough power to drive it </s>
<s> one last comment do remember that all disks eventually die so do remember to keep a backup of the movies etc on your external drive </s>
<s> one copy is never enough </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> for the most part the portable external hard drives are powered via a cable connection to the usb port of a computer </s>
<s> also almost all of this type are flash drives while the quot regular big ones quot are standard hard drives using lasers in an enclosure with plug in power supply </s>
<s> portable drives use 2 5 quot hard drives which are typically smaller in capacity and slower </s>
<s> regular external hard drives non portable use 3 5 quot hard drives which are larger in capacity and faster </s>
<s> 2 5 quot portable hard drives are usually 5400 rpm and 3 5 quot hard drives are usually 7200 rpm but now a day s 2 5 quot drives also comes in 7200 rpm </s>
<s> generally a 2 5 quot portable drive comes without external power </s>
<s> for the 3 5 quot disk you ll need that adapter </s>
<s> portable are more expensive but it is convenient because you can take it anywhere with you </s>
<s> i have the strontium ssd matrix portable hard drive </s>
<s> it is easy to carry and also you need not to worry about protection because it comes with protection case </s>
