<s> encrypting files consistently at the folder level will ensure that files do not get decrypted unexpectedly </s>
<s> the private keys associated with recovery certificates are extremely sensitive </s>
<s> they should be generated either on a computer that is physically secured or their certificates should be completely exported to a pfx file protected under a strong password and stored on a secure floppy disk </s>
<s> recovery agent certificates should be assigned to special recovery agent accounts that are not used for any other purpose </s>
<s> do not destroy recovery certificates or private keys when recovery agents are changed which should occur periodically </s>
