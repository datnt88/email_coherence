<s> i ve been using my linksys wireless b usb network adapter ver 4 to get my internet connection for about 3 4 years now i know they there is something newer better than my linksys network adapter out there </s>
<s> i want something that does exzactly the same thing hooks up to my laptop exzactly the way my linksys does just something more modern perhaps more powerful </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> please thank you </s>
<s> what do you mean with quot newer and better and more modern and perhaps more powerful quot </s>
<s> is there anything that doesn t function to your satisfaction now </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> if it works well i would not bother upgrading </s>
<s> even a b wireless is faster than most people have for internet </s>
<s> you will just get the data to the router faster and then it goes over your same slow internet </s>
<s> the newest technology does have a little better coverage but if you are not having issues you basically can only make it worse </s>
<s> if you are going to replace your stuff you might as well buy n stuff </s>
<s> this will run b and g also but most models you must pick one you cannot run all at the same time </s>
<s> you need to replace all your equipment at the same time </s>
<s> so its not just as simple as buying a 20 usb adapter </s>
<s> now if you just want new toys for christmas thats a good reason too </s>
