<s> i m able to get the ssid s in the range using vbscript and i would like to know is there a way to get the list of sta s ie systems under each ssid s using vbscript </s>
<s> i m not able to find any resources in the internet </s>
<s> anyone plz help me out </s>
<s> thanks in advance baskaran </s>
<s> the code is possible but if i were to do this i wouldn t hamper my efforts and limit my language choice </s>
<s> if you want to get into this go look for wepcrack and such since the source is readily available </s>

<s> thnx for ur reply i think u r asking me to refer to the open source wep cracking stuff </s>
<s> is there a direct vbscript or any other program sources available for listing the sta s under an ssid like a vbscript that i ve got for listing the ap s </s>
<s> i mean to ask is there any official and diplomatic way in knowing the sta s without using the hacking and cracking stuff hoping for ur reply baskaran </s>
<s> reuse the code that determined the ssids and such </s>
<s> but no i do not know of code that meets your requirements that is in your selected language and ready to use </s>
<s> i bet you ll have to find working source in any language and modify it to your needs </s>
<s> there is a fast way to cheat on this </s>
<s> if this was my system i could get the status page from my wifi router and it lists the currently connected clients </s>
