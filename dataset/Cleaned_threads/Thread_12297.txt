<s> hello i have been having some trouble with my laptop </s>
<s> i have a hp pavillion dv8000 with windows xp </s>
<s> none of my usb ports seem to work when i plug something in the error message titled quot usb device not recognized quot pops up and the device does not operate </s>
<s> i have researched this as much as possible for about 2 hours now and i have tried these methods </s>
<s> unpluging power cord and battery deleting the items for usb under device manager checking for updates in windows update scanning for hardware changes in device manager i would really appreciate some help </s>
<s> i have service pack 3 </s>
<s> if it ever worked since the os was installed </s>
<s> the most common failure here is the bum install of the os </s>
<s> this dv8000 has an onerous install procedure too similar to this gt this is why i use the restore media as folk rarely will pay for the 2 to 5 days to install xp </s>

<s> do you get any error mark in device driver section of usb in device manager </s>
<s> best bet is to update or reinstall the drivers and also check with another usb device on all the ports </s>
<s> also use the inbuilt hw diagnostic for any information in regards to this </s>
<s> try this </s>
<s> unplug a usb device wait 10 seconds </s>
<s> then hold down the shift key on the keyboard while plugging the usb device back in </s>
<s> sounds like your laptop is missing the required drivers for the motherboard not windows drivers </s>
<s> check your system using the control panel device manager and look for the usb tab </s>
<s> if it has a question mark of x beside it you need to install the machines drivers so that the computer itself can recognize the ports </s>
<s> download the required driver from the manufacturers website and install them or after downloading update the drivers from the control panel using the download </s>
<s> should work perfectly after that markinto </s>
<s> the mac os x and the pc ntfs use different operating systems and devices formatted specifically for one will not function in the other </s>
<s> fat 32 is a universal standard which allows external devices like hd s thumb drives and memory cards to be used interchangeably to transport data back and forth etc </s>
<s> so perhaps you have some devices specifically formatted for the mac or perhaps some other system </s>
<s> so you might check your formatting </s>
