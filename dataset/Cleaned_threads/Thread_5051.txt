<s> anyway from the front to where they keyboard starts including the touch pad has kind of bent upward </s>
<s> i can see all the orange wires and they look all connected mite not be but when the laptop is on they keyboard will no longer work having to use a usb keyboard any ideas what it could be </s>
<s> loose connection </s>

<s> thanks mf </s>
<s> just a few other things i should mention osx tiger 15 quot 80gb thanks mf </s>

<s> just helping out a friend who isnt to good when it comes to computers </s>
<s> also wondering if there is anything i should know or do before taking the casing off </s>
<s> mf </s>
<s> i don t like fixing my friend s computers that have suffered such damage since the unit could decide to turn into a brick just by removing the case </s>
<s> it s suffered some hard times but still works </s>
<s> until you are sure they are ok with getting a brick back i d leave it alone </s>
<s> plus if you do why open it unless you have the spare parts to put in </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> really just to check if anything was loose but if its risky i l leave it unless he decides he is going to buy a new one </s>
<s> he is holding the front together with tape at the moment any ideas how to bend the front panel back into place </s>
<s> when i had a look there were lots of small round marks round the edge but could not see any screws missing </s>
<s> thanks mf </s>
<s> there is no magic there but i use a body shop down the road and they do amazing work </s>
<s> i m not so good at that </s>
<s> gt for me i would be hitting ebay to see if i could scrounge up a not so bent up case </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will have to get him on ebay befor he gets the old hammer out thanks for all your help </s>
