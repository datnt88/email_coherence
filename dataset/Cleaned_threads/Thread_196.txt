<s> my motherboard took a bad flash a while back wouldn t post and didn t have a replaceable bios so i had to buy a new one so yeah it s not like i had the chance to back up everything on my c partition of my hdd </s>
<s> i have a samsung sv1203n and i just bought an abit ai7 </s>
<s> i m running windows xp pro </s>
<s> this is my problem the abit does recognize my hdd when it s set as master and gives me the ntldr error </s>
<s> when i tried popping the windows xp cd in it first of all didn t detect my other partitions just my c partition and to my understanding if it doesn t detect my other 90 something gigs it ll install as if they don t exist and ruin the data that s on them </s>
<s> tell me if i m wrong on this </s>
<s> anyways the second problem is that windows will not give me a repair option and will not let me simply install the os over the top of the os that s there </s>
<s> it tells me that the hdd is either corrupted or too full too full sounds more like it the entire 30 something gigs is full since i used all the empty space in that partition to back up some data for my boyfriend and that i have to completely format it to install windows </s>
<s> i don t want to loose the data i backed up on it but i will if i have to only if i have to </s>
<s> i m mainly worried about the other two partitions on there that windows isn t detecting </s>
<s> now this is where it gets really wierd if i slave it in my boyfriend s computer the hdd and all the partitions show up </s>
<s> right now on my new motherboard i m using a 10 gig which has enough space on it for me to move the data from the c partition on my old hdd on to it so i can install windows on my old hdd </s>
<s> but when i try slaving my old hdd to the 10 gig it doesn t show up </s>
<s> the bios doesn t even recognize it s there </s>
<s> i did manage to get windows to let me install it over the old copy of windows on the hdd but i still get the ntldr error </s>
<s> it looks like my only choice is to somehow get my motherboard to recognize my hdd as a slave so i can pull the data off it and reformat </s>
<s> can someone please please help me out with this </s>
<s> this is a hardware forum and it appears you ve licked that issue </s>
<s> now you need to repair install xp or maybe do a parallel install which the xp forum has more traffic and discussion </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes you will have problems </s>
<s> go to this link and folow what it says </s>
<s> john </s>
