<s> i need help with an ongoing cd dvd writer issue that s really driving me nuts </s>
<s> recently i had some pc problems replaced my main system hard drive and repairs were made to my motherboard s batteries </s>
<s> i had one problem after another </s>
<s> lately i ve been having consistent problems with my dvd writer </s>
<s> when i inserted a dvd or cd blank or not my pc shut down as soon as it began to read the disk </s>
<s> if i booted my pc with a disk in it shut down immediately </s>
<s> this happened the great majority of the time but not always </s>
<s> i tried uninstalling the drivers and adding them back on but it did not help </s>
<s> i disabled and then enabled the drive </s>
<s> i removed the drive and then added it back in the device manager </s>
<s> i also replaced the cable and checked the jumpers </s>
<s> i virus checked my system </s>
<s> the manufacturer suggested that i use microsoft s fix it program but it asked for a disk to be inserted and this resulted in a shutdown </s>
<s> finally </s>
<s> i assumed it was a hardware issue and i replaced the drive </s>
<s> the problem continues as before </s>
<s> the same fix attempts have failed </s>
<s> any suggestions would be helpful </s>
<s> thanks john os windows xp sp3 new cd dvd writer lg gh24ns95 sata old cd dvd writer lg gh22np21 ide </s>
<s> xp even with sp3 does not have native sata support so this is a nightmare of drivers issues and arcane information for most users </s>
<s> unless you have a geek guru friend i suggest you forget sata and get another ide drive </s>
<s> and for the same bucks you usually can get some usb external dvdrw and get a bonus that you can use it on many other pcs </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if the problem happens with both an ide and sata drive it must be something other than a sata related problem </s>
<s> how would going back to another ide drive help </s>
<s> i m also looking to keep an internal drive rather than switch to external </s>
<s> then it means there is still an os or driver issue </s>
<s> it could be hardware since many xp machines are past their expected life span </s>
<s> that alone can cause owners to explode in some fit of rage but when it comes to having a stable pc you know it matters </s>
<s> again sata appears to be enabled and the driver issues alone should scare most support away </s>
<s> disable sata in the bios remove the sata drive and replace any optical drive older than 2 years for a test run </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> just out of curiosity what shows up in device manager at the drive location see errors </s>
<s> we still don t know your actual pc model </s>
<s> it makes a difference knowing the details </s>
<s> also because i assume you re now using sata that it wasn t before </s>
<s> if not its the 1st time now using a sata device check the bios and see if any quot legacy or ide mode quot for sata is present if so enable it </s>
<s> if you have an sata hd that could conflict because the servicing or polling of devices gets hammered as ide devices still present lag the system and on top of all this is xp os not overall friendly to sata as it wasn t native to it </s>
<s> alas you had a problem prior to all this so i ask was sata present then </s>
<s> what happens if you disconnect the ide type cd dvd drive </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> no errors quot this device is working properly quot </s>
<s> willy it s not a name brand pc </s>
<s> it has a foxconn winfast motherboard nf4sk8aa 8ekrs socket 939 with an amd athlon 64 processor 3700 ghz cpu </s>
<s> i ve had a sata hd for some time and it coexisted well with my previous ide dvd writer for years </s>
<s> then about a month ago the problems started </s>
<s> after a lot of attempts to solve things i gave up assumed it was a problem with the dvd drive </s>
<s> i replaced it with the new sata dvd writer </s>
<s> the ide writer is gone but the issues continue </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> clear this up quot it s not a name brand pc quot are you saying this is another mtrbd </s>
<s> than before </s>
<s> did you do a fresh install of the os from scratch with all the new parts </s>
<s> if you re trying w o the new install that maybe an issue as previous installs and or drivers conflict </s>
<s> having a socket 939 also tells me it s a dated mtrbd </s>
<s> which is no longer provided out there </s>
<s> if you re saying it worked before but now telling me it s a different pc well it s not the same is it </s>
<s> you re throwing a curve ball in there and if you didn t wipe the hd to do a fresh install as i stated it gets hosed one way or another </s>
<s> i can t tell fully from your posts which is why i asked about details </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> by not a name brand i meant it is not a dell hp </s>
<s> etc </s>
<s> as i said in my first post work was done on my foxconn mb </s>
<s> it is the original and same one </s>
<s> i put in a new system hd so i had to do a fresh install of xp </s>
<s> this is a lot of posts and i can t tell if you are doing tests without the hdd and just a live cd </s>
<s> i have more ideas such as discussing how the pc boots how cpu microcode can be in the boot area and of course bad caps </s>
<s> foxconn made millions of bad cap boards </s>
