<s> i have a d link boxee box that i want to use to stream hd movies tv locally and from the internet </s>
<s> i have beeen looking at new routers like the netgear n900 to increase my speed and throughput </s>
<s> i would then go from modem gt router gt switch gt boxee and other devices gt tv i need the switch as i have other devices in my entertainment system that require internet access </s>
<s> my question is even if i buy a superfast router will my through put be limited by the switch </s>
<s> thanks robert </s>
<s> than what streaming hd movies require </s>
<s> no gain there </s>
<s> however the best fix is to not use wifi if at all possible </s>
<s> i picked up a powerline network to get away from wifi </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will use cable from the new router to the switch and then cable to my network devices such as the boxee </s>
<s> my current problem is that i get constant buffering when trying to stream from the internet </s>
<s> i was originally wi fi and then ran a cable directly from my d link 615 router but there were no improvments that s why i figured that a new faster router might help </s>
<s> there are some things you can try now such as router defaults except what the isp requires as well as turning off wifi for a test run </s>
<s> i don t see the rest of the system and other details to note if it s the old netflix at 6pm issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i am trying to stream mostly from the internet sites like quot watchseries quot on the boxee box </s>
<s> it is a constant problem not time of day related when you say quot that 615 quot is that a bad thing </s>
<s> ps thanks for the fast replys </s>
<s> if you were buying a switch what would you choose for this application </s>
<s> it can be site specific </s>
<s> the 615 is a value router </s>
<s> it would be fine most of the time </s>
<s> try this on youtube or better sites </s>
<s> you should find the lesser known video sites to struggle to keep up with demand </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will try tonight </s>
