<s> my rig has very specific power requirements and this is the only one i can find with the power and user reviews being positive </s>
<s> tom s hardware guide doesn t list it in any reviews though </s>
<s> i ve vaguely heard of this brand and it seemed to be positive </s>
<s> the brand that thg recommends antec doesn t put out enough 12v current </s>
<s> i think the highest for antec was 19 amps at the 12v </s>
<s> i m needing at least 25 amps at the 12v </s>
<s> there are quite a few other brands that say their ps s put out the required current but thg says many brands fib </s>
<s> which brings me back to the subject header thanks for any help </s>
<s> i don t own one myself but it has been highly recommended by many in these forums </s>
<s> given your requirements i would contact the seller for additional assurance and or guarantee of it s performance </s>
<s> if you know what you need and can t find it then certainly pcp c is close to whatever you need </s>
<s> you may even want to talk to them for special needs provided you have the wallet for it </s>
<s> in other words you truly get what you pay for </s>
<s> you may want to check this website i wish my end uers had pcp c just to step away from persistant atx power issues </s>
<s> yeah they re expensive but the end result is far better that what s usually offered out there </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
