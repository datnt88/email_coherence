<s> dell dimension 2400 xp host dell inspiron 1521 vista zyxel p 300w router i set this network up last month with the zyxel cd and out of the box the network worked fine </s>
<s> however i ve managed to somehow mess up the system so that now it will not share printer or files no problem with web connection </s>
<s> much of my confusion centers on terminology namely the difference between quot network name quot quot ssid name quot quot local area connection quot and quot router name quot </s>
<s> currently it looks like the same name is being applied to each depending on where you re looking is this problematic </s>
<s> frankly i m not sure where one sets or changes these names especially with the two different os </s>
<s> if i look at quot my network places quot on the host dell d 2400 all i see is the router and something named quot my web sites on msn </s>
<s> no mention of any computers or printer </s>
<s> and if i look at quot network and sharing quot on the laptop the map of my network shows both computers and the router but no printer </s>
<s> i ve done and redone network and wireless setups on both computers multiple times this may be compounding the problem </s>
<s> and always must try to make manual settings since my quot host quot computer will only allow me to make a network system disk on a floopy and the laptop has no floopy drive </s>
<s> and when i try to use the xp install disk it simply deposits some files on the laptop and thats it </s>
<s> so i try to do manual setups but something s not right </s>
<s> i suspect that i ve simply changed a setting somewhere but after 3 days of changing and re changing everything i m at my wits end </s>
<s> i ve spent a good deal of time looking at the archives here but am not finding anything that helps </s>
<s> thanks for any advice or suggestion on how to resolve this </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> for the most part if both computers are able to access the internet then you can pretty much forget about the router and wireless settings having anything to do with your problems </s>
<s> if you were able to see each computer share files and printers when you first set up the network then the most likely cause or your initial problems at that time would probably be related to an issue with your internet security software </s>
<s> norton mcafee or other firewall software are famous for blocking the network interaction between computers </s>
<s> try disabling all firewall software on both computers </s>
<s> if that works then you will have to go into and change the settings in each firewall until you find the problem </s>
<s> unfortunately since you have been playing with the system you may have created a whole new set of problems </s>
<s> so in general you need to check all of the following to allow the computers to talk to each other on the network </s>
<s> 1 each computer must have a uniquely different computer name </s>
<s> 2 each computer must be assigned to the same workgroup name </s>
<s> 3 firewall software must be configured correctly </s>
<s> 4 file and print sharing must be turned on in the windows firewall if using it </s>
<s> 5 a file folder and printer must be actually shared as indicated by a hand under the file or printer name </s>
<s> dana wayland computer </s>
<s> appreciate your response spent the morning trying your suggestions here s my results computers have unique names can t see any conflicts </s>
<s> firewalls settings look ok on both btw the laptop has a mcafee and a window s fw should i disable one </s>
<s> i think there s a problem with the way the laptop vista is handling the workgroup in control panel network it shows the correctly named workgroup with only the two correctly named computers and no other devices and another workgroup named quot unspecified quot that shows an quot internet gateway device quot and the logos of quot media player quot for two of the users on the laptop </s>
<s> i don t know how to merge the two workgroups or delete one </s>
<s> although i ve tried to add my printer canon s750 to my correct workgroup it won t show here </s>
<s> and when i try to add a quot wireless device quot vista says it can t find any </s>
<s> under cp network and sharing it correctly shows the laptop the correctly named network private and the internet </s>
<s> on network map it shows correct network name both computers switch and internet </s>
<s> no printer here either </s>
<s> i m also noticing something strange in the laptop s control panel network connections it shows two connections a local area connection using broadcom integrated controller that is x ed out and a wireless network connection using a dell wireless wlan minicard that is active </s>
<s> i haven t touched these as yet </s>
<s> that s enough for now i suspect you ll find some issues in all that at least i hope you do </s>
<s> thanks dana for helping with this </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> post 10 please remember to install the drivers for the printer in your laptop rick </s>
<s> yes i saw your tip and i went to canon s site and looked for an updated driver for vista </s>
<s> however only the xp driver was available </s>
<s> so i dl ed that one and installed on vista laptop </s>
<s> do you think that ll cause problems </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> with printer sharing </s>
<s> there was a whole post on this </s>
<s> your answer lies in this post </s>
<s> udating the drivers for the printer does help but if you look at how kaufmanmoore gave the instructions on how he solved this problem and everyone else responded to him about how it worked you ll understand what i m trying to tell you </s>
<s> read the post entirely and i think you ll have a better understanding on what is going on </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> even though mcafee firewall my look fine you should still disable it just to make sure </s>
<s> you never want 2 firewalls or 2 antivirus programs running at the same time so disable 1 firewall </s>
<s> please review this document on print and files sharing with vista </s>
<s> network connections should show 2 types of connections </s>
<s> one is your wireless and the other local connection is for a hard wired ethernet connection </s>
<s> the hardware local connection should show that it is disconnected at this point unless you plug your laptop directly into your network </s>
<s> some people may even disable the local connection if they want </s>
<s> i read and followed the suggestions of kaufmanmoore at first i couldn t get the host desktop to create a new local port but then being a basically paranoid guy i uninstalled both instances of network magic came with the zyxel router from each machine and backed up each to a date prior to nm s initial install </s>
<s> worked like a charm </s>
<s> now i d hate to be left thinking that the folks at network magic slipped a gremlin into their software that causes newbies like me to think nothing will work except buying that expensive solution but i do anyway </s>
<s> only problem left is i m still getting a message each time the laptop prints that says the printer driver needs updating however i did dl the new needed driver but since there is no actual printer to install in the laptop i had to manually install the driver and it installed into the same folder in dl ed into </s>
<s> i suspect that s incorrect </s>
<s> any final suggestion on how i can get it into a better location </s>
<s> thanks rick i appreciate your invaluable assistance </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> this is really a vista glitch </s>
<s> most drivers are in the system32 folder </s>
<s> c windows system32 printer drivers need to be installed in each computer </s>
<s> my home printer setup is dell wireless printer adapter 3300 plugged into my dell photo aio printer 964 i installed the printer drivers in all three laptops windows xp </s>
<s> i do not have to leave a host computer on to print </s>
<s> daughter can print from her room son can also aand i can print from the back patio when it s nice out </s>
<s> we use a netgear router that has the firmware updated broadcast ssid use wpa security wep can be hacked use nothing else </s>
<s> never loose a connection and we can always print scan copy or fax when we want to </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> all is well i can print from the laptop and share files from the host computer as well </s>
<s> but there are two remaining nags both of which are not killers but i d like to solve them anyway </s>
<s> each time i print from the laptop i get a popup message that says there is something wrong with the print monitor and it suggests that printer drivers be installed at all locations in the network just as you said </s>
<s> but i have done that as best as i know how i dl ed the only available drivers from the canon site a win xp driver and a vista patch manually installed them god only knows where they installed no indication of where during the process and it ends by telling me that they were successfully installed </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> however as i m getting that pop up message the printing process is going on sucessfully </s>
<s> the other nag is that if i go into quot network and sharing center quot on the laptop vista under quot sharing and discovery quot it says quot there are no printers attached to this computer quot </s>
<s> is that ok </s>
<s> seems to me it should be telling me if there is a printer attached to this network right </s>
<s> and there is a printer on the network </s>
<s> but as i said i can live with both of these but of course i d like them both to be correct </s>
<s> thanks again rick for all your help </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> i can t answer your question </s>
<s> i don t have vista so you may be able to find the answer wating for someone to post or you may want to post the question in the windows vista forum </s>
<s> if you have to post the url for this post and maybe this will also help someone steer you in the right direction </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> you ve already helped quite a bit </s>
<s> i ll take your advice again and begin hanging out on the vista forum lord knows there s a lot to learn </s>
<s> thanks again rick </s>
