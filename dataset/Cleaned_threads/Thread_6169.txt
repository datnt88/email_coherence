<s> hi i hope someone can help </s>
<s> i m attempting to share files and a printer between two pcs </s>
<s> it should be easy </s>
<s> i ve read everything and googled everything but cannot figure out what my problem is </s>
<s> two pcs one is windows xp media edition the other is xp pro </s>
<s> the media edition has the printer </s>
<s> both pcs are hard wired into a linksys wrt54gs </s>
<s> this router has 4 wired connections plus wireless which i can use to connect with my laptop this works great </s>
<s> the files and printer are quot shared quot i ve turned off the firewall to make sure this isn t causing my problem </s>
<s> both pcs are using the same workgroup name </s>
<s> setting up printer to access my printer i click on printers and faxes gt add a printer gt wizard i select quot a network printer quot gt then select connect to this printer or browse for a printer gt i click on microsoft windows network which shows me the pc containing the printer </s>
<s> however no printer is displayed </s>
<s> when i click next it says quot you need to specify a valid network printer name quot so i give the printer name that i used on the quot share name quot on the pc with the printer </s>
<s> it rejects it </s>
<s> so no way to view the printer </s>
<s> setting up access to files when i go into windows explorer i click on my network places gt microsoft windows network gt workgroup gt and then the two pcs are listed below </s>
<s> when i click on the pc containing the printer i get the following message tomsmachine is not accessible </s>
<s> you might not have permission to use this network resource </s>
<s> contact the administrator of this server </s>
<s> the network path was not found </s>
<s> these machines are single users admin rights on both pcs </s>
<s> i ve started the logging for security but do not find any error messages </s>
<s> any idea on what i m doing wrong or forgot to do </s>
<s> thanks so much in advance for your help </s>
<s> tom </s>
<s> have the same name and password </s>
<s> have you tried to set up a share other than the printer </s>
<s> does it work </s>
<s> turning on file and print sharing doesn t share individual folders or printers </s>
<s> those are done separately </s>
<s> does the printer have a hand under the icon for it </s>
<s> if not you need to do that as well </s>
<s> run the network setup wizard on both machines </s>
<s> turn on file and printer sharing on both </s>
<s> give both the same network name </s>
<s> on the last step on both machines click the something like quot dont run on another machine just finish quot </s>
<s> steven for both pcs i only have one account which is administrator </s>
<s> for example when i hit start the top says administrator </s>
<s> i ve tried to share files and printers all i can see the pc name </s>
<s> under files and printers i do see a quot hand quot from the research i ve done it appears that windows xp media edition is similar to xp home </s>
<s> but i should be able to connect xp home with xp pro </s>
<s> thanks tom </s>
<s> coryphaeus i ve done exactly what you said </s>
<s> there is a hand under the c drive on both machines </s>
<s> however since the printer is only defined to one machine i have this set up only on one machine </s>
<s> when a attempt to add a printer and search the network it finds the correct machine but doesn t list the printer </s>
<s> after doing some research i noticed something when i m on the machine with the printer i can display the following ipconfig connection specific dsn suffix </s>
<s> ip address 192 168 1 100 subnet mask 255 255 255 0 default gateway 192 168 1 1 c ping 192 168 1 101 which is the other machine pinging from 192 168 1 101 bytes 32 time but from the other pc here s what i get ipconfig connection specific dsn suffix </s>
<s> ip address 192 168 1 101 subnet mask 255 255 255 0 default gateway 192 168 1 1 c ping 192 168 1 100 which is the machine with the printer pinging 192 168 1 100 with 32 bytes of data request timed out </s>
<s> request timed out it seems one machine can get to the other but the other cannot get back </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> thanks tom </s>
<s> in how they can be configured </s>
<s> first off i d be creating a user account other than the administrator account </s>
<s> you didn t mention whether or not you used a password </s>
<s> always create a username giving it a password and make sure the same is configured on both machines </s>
<s> if you haven t tried already you can disable the firewall on both to see if that s part of the issue </s>
