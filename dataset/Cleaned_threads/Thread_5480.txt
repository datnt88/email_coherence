<s> i think i asked this question before and got something of a vague response </s>
<s> i have a dell computer from 2006 an xps 410 and my video card is an nvidia geforce 9500 gt </s>
<s> now i ve heard that with some resolutions it s not possible to see the computer on the tv screen but 640x480 works best and full screen games are just fine </s>
<s> my monitor is capable of going to 640x480 </s>
<s> now my other question is that i m planning on getting a new computer soon also a dell not sure which one yet </s>
<s> it s going to be widescreen whereas the one i have now is a standard definition resolution monitor </s>
<s> will that impact what cable i need or will it work for both an older and a newer computer </s>
<s> i m quite confused by this so any help is much appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> no mention of the make model of the tv as well as what connections are on the pc </s>
<s> i fear the answers must remain vague without details </s>
<s> for example you connect same to same video inputs and outputs </s>
<s> it s that simple </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well my tv now has the standard s video ports red white yellow although i suppose in the future i could get an hdtv </s>
<s> the make of the tv is sansui i m not even familiar with the company </s>
<s> not sure what the model is but does it matter </s>
<s> i thought all that mattered were the connections </s>
<s> i have no fancy connections on the computer just the outlets and the monitor </s>
<s> your standard red yellow white av connections while not s video see are rarely found on a pc </s>
<s> be very clear that composite and svideo is going to be unacceptable to most so far nearly 100 </s>
<s> so i strongly suggest you don t spend a dime on this </s>
<s> unless your pc has composite out why not try this another way </s>
<s> many want to watch content from the pc on the tv but given we are going to get 1 3 to 1 4 the pixels as the vga display again you find that folk after expending money and effort are often upset with the results </s>
<s> this changes if you have a hdtv </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> does this tv have a monitor or hdmi connector on it </s>
<s> if so you ll dig it otherwise it s a fuzzy waste </s>
<s> also is your 9500gt built in the motherboard or did you add it later </s>
<s> look on the back of it it probably has an s video plug </s>
<s> hey guys they have hdmi outputs on video cards yet </s>
<s> analog will drive you insane and s video will make ya beat your dog </s>
<s> maybe your 9500 has hdmi output it resembles a usb slot the fuzzy picture you get on your tv will dissapoint unless you run a lcd plasma or theater projector they look as good as any pc monitor </s>
<s> the number of pins in the connector used dictates how good the tv picture will look 1 monitor 12 pins lose job girlfriend 2 hdmi vs 12 pin </s>
<s> similar to 12 pin 2 compsite 6 pins never seen these 3 s video 4 pins begin to hate pcs 4 analog 2 pins housecleaning is more fun second your video card can throw super hi def in widescreen 16 9 or standard 4 3 it s in the cards settings and has nothing to do with whatever screen used </s>
<s> note monitors support limited resolutions but far more than 640x480 unless your tv monitor is ancient </s>
<s> so if i do get an hdtv and obtain a newer model 2010 2011 computer my best option is to go with composite connections </s>
<s> could you explain a bit further on composite and what i d need to go ahead and do that </s>
<s> maybe my best bet would ve been to wait until i get a new computer and an hdtv before i ask again </s>
<s> my computer tv are fairly old </s>
<s> the computer is a 2006 model and the tv i m not even sure of </s>
<s> i basically bought it used at a yard sale </s>
<s> it might be a 2004 2005 model but i m not sure </s>
<s> but i explained this and i fear one more time will not improve it </s>
<s> try this </s>
<s> head to a store and have them explain the options again </s>
