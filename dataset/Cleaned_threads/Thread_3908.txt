<s> i just bought a usb 2 0 pci host card to upgrade from 1 1 when i booted up after i plugged it in my computer locked up after about 20 30 seconds </s>
<s> it seems to be at the very end of the boot up right after i get the quot new hardware found quot message </s>
<s> the card is generic i think with an nec chip </s>
<s> i have windows xp home which i updated fully through ms website but problem occurs the same </s>
<s> problem goes away with no side effects when card is removed and re booted </s>
<s> i have a p4 2 2 with 512m ram </s>
<s> lock up occurs with card plugged in each of my open slots to cover my bases </s>
<s> any ideas suggestions would be much appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> sounds like a faulty card or somekind of conflict with xp </s>
<s> maybe try the card in another machine and see what happens </s>

<s> your post neglected to tell what chipset the motherboard is since the motherboard drivers are often not updated by microsoft </s>
<s> this and more at bob </s>
<s> i apologize for any ignorance on my part </s>
<s> i am far from an expert on this issue </s>
<s> i went to your website and downloaded bios agent which reported my chipset to be intel 1a30 rev 4 i have no idea what this means but hopefully it is what you were talking about </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
