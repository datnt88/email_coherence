<s> i dont what to get </s>
<s> i am getting a new computer for my 16th birthday for sure but idk which one </s>
<s> my parents are willing to spend about 1200 not much more </s>
<s> at first i was going to get a refurb aluminum unibody macbook pro 2 4ghz for 1600 but i would have to spend 400 of my own money i was very set on this until my friend said i should build my own custom pc </s>
<s> i really really love the look of the macbook pro which is why i was gonna buy it </s>
<s> i also really love portability </s>
<s> but the macbook pro isnt very powerful and for 1200 i can get a custom built pc from ibuypower com </s>

<s> now i know the pc specs blow away the macbook pro </s>

<s> so i dont know how much id use it portable but im sure i wuld </s>
<s> also the macbook pro is amazing looking </s>
<s> so which do you think i should get </s>
<s> please leave all your thoughts thanks </s>
<s> hi i bought i gaming laptop 2 6ghz dual core amd with nvidia 7900gtx go 17 1 quot graphics and was happy for a short space of time the reason when i wanted more performance after a year there was nothing i could do except to get faster ram bigger hard drive and re install windows </s>
<s> it cost me 1600 and i regret it up to this day </s>
<s> recently i spend 1450 on building my own core i7 pc my first build and it was really easy i have a large 24 quot monitor 920 i7 processor 4870 1gb ati card 1tb hdd 12gb ddr3 ram asus p6t deluxe motherboard coolermaster m850 thermaltake armour case creative titanium x fi sound card compro dual dvb t tv card and windows vista 64 bit </s>
<s> the processor can be overclocked with ease whenever i want to although it s not currently necessary to do so as it is able to run everything well and i have no problems when i need more power i can always upgrade components one at a time at a later stage </s>
<s> at the end of the day it depends on your needs do you want a computer that you can take everywhere or do you want something with performance that can serve you for many many years with upgrades </s>
<s> since you are 16 you probably need a computer that you can carry around to do all of your academic studies and some light gaming not sure about macs for gaming never used one before but this is the rationale that you should use when trying to make a decision good luck with the choice and remember whatever you get will only be regarded as the best choice if it is able to serve all of your needs requirements hope this helps </s>
<s> thanks for the response </s>
<s> if i may ask where did you purchase your core i7 machine or did you build it yourself </s>
<s> also what would be a good windows laptop thats as good as the macbook pro but cheaper </s>
<s> hi i purchased all the components for my build from 3 retailers in the uk scan co uk overclockers co uk tekheads co uk and yes i built the system myself it was really very easy and there s a wealth of knowledge on the internet should you have problems and it s cheaper than buying a pre built system </s>
<s> a good windows laptop will be something like alienware s area 51 m15x it s great for portability and has plenty of oomph to play some decent games if you don t want to buy from alienware try msi or novatech etc </s>
<s> you should find something similar </s>
