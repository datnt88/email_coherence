<s> i posted this on a different forum and then came across the networking forum any help would be appreciated thanks quot i have two computers and i use linksys b wireless broadband router to connect computer 2 to the internet from computer 1 comp 1 is my primary cpu and i do not use comp 2 that often </s>
<s> i am going to be purchasing a new printer primarily for photos and will connect it to comp 1 and take my old printer and use it with comp 2 now comp 2 is on a different level on the house </s>
<s> i plan on networking the two computers so i can send a print job documents etc </s>
<s> to the comp 2 printer </s>
<s> here is my question is it possible to have the computer in power save mode and still send a print job to the computer </s>
<s> by sending a print job will the computer wake up and then print </s>
<s> my printer turns on by itself when a print job is sent to the printer </s>
<s> since i use comp 2 very infrequently i don t want to keep it on all the time i would prefer to leave it on powersave mode </s>
<s> is what i am suggesting on doing feasible </s>
<s> i ve never really networked computers except for internet access so i am very naive in this area </s>
<s> thanks for any help and suggestions quot </s>
<s> unless the os is running on the remote pc it s not going to be able to respond automatically to a print command but i m not sure what you mean by power saving mode </s>
<s> anything like standby or hibernate is not going to work </s>
<s> it might be possible use a wol wake on lan scheme but these are rather tricky and in my limited experience with them a bit flaky too that s the best i can describe these as i ve only used them with nas hardware </s>
<s> you can certainly just turn off the monitor and leave the pc running perhaps even allow the hd to power down but i have to wonder if another option might be just to use a network print server </s>
<s> the downside of these is finding compatibility between printer and server </s>
<s> they don t all work gracefully </s>
<s> but if that s an option you can leave the other pc off and it will still have access to the printer when you do turn it on </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> by power saving mode i really meant sleep mode </s>
<s> if this doesn t work can i send a print job to the computer when it is off or in sleep mode and then print it when i wake or turn the computer on </s>
<s> i am still not even sure how i network computers so i am probably jumping the gun here but this is the reason why i want to network so i would want to make sure it is possible before i go through the work of trying to figure out how to network </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> it may remain as a pending print job from the originating pc and keep trying but this might tie up other print processes </s>
<s> so no sending a print job to a sleeping pc isn t going to work </s>
<s> it needs to be on and ready to act as a print server </s>
<s> again a network type print server is another option but you need to check printer compatibility with these first </s>
<s> if you put together a network and want to share printers having the printers on the network via servers external or internal is really the best way to go </s>
<s> btw you d still need to have your printer turned on using the remote pc as a server and it would be consuming a small bit of power anyway </s>
