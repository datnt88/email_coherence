<s> i just bought a new pc with a sata hard drive fine </s>
<s> i have an ide hard drive that i wanted to put in to in as a second drive from my old pc </s>
<s> is there compatibility issues that i don t of </s>
<s> i tried for a good while to get it to see it but it won t </s>
<s> anyone have a idea </s>
<s> the sata drive doesn t connect to the traditional ide port obviously so i m thinking that has something to do with it </s>
<s> i don t know </s>
<s> can anyone help </s>
<s> rich </s>
<s> for the ribbon cable for your old pata drive </s>
<s> nowadays we must use pata and sata because both are actuall ide drives as well as ata drives </s>
<s> the data cable for pata drives are the 40 pin ribbons </s>
<s> sata data cable is much smaller </s>
<s> the sytem should see the older drive if you have it jumpered properly for how it is plugged into the new computer </s>
<s> probably need to jumper the drive as cable select cs </s>
<s> some pcs don t come with all the interfaces ports enabled in the bios </s>
<s> check your pc mobo manual </s>
<s> also is it plugged into the power and spinning up </s>
<s> i ve made that simple mistake more than i d care to admit </s>
<s> the only place it says disabled is in the raid configuration but i m not trying to set up a raid configuration </s>
<s> as far as power i don t hear it spinning but the power connector appears to come directly from the power supply </s>
<s> usually you can feel a drive spin up </s>
<s> put your finger on the top smooth side of the drive and cold boot your pc you should feel a difference </s>
<s> if this came from an old pc put it back in that pc and see if it still works </s>
<s> if so network the two and copy the data </s>
<s> i m sorry but i can t think of anything else that might help figuring out why it won t work in your new one </s>
