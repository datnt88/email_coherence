<s> i have an e machine t1440 </s>
<s> it has a 1 40ghz intel celeron processor running windows xp home edition </s>
<s> it came with 128mb sdram </s>
<s> i added a stick of 256mb sdram to it </s>
<s> when i check the computer to see how much memory there is it still says 128 i was told that it will detect the added ram automatically </s>
<s> i added the ram because i was getting low memory popups </s>
<s> i am still getting them </s>
<s> did the computer not take the new ram </s>
<s> the new stick of ram has been tested good also </s>
<s> does the ram show in bios </s>
<s> if not try taking out the old stick and swapping slots </s>
<s> or make sure rams inserted correctly </s>
<s> if control panel system still shows only 128k then the memory is not being recognized </s>
<s> either it is the wrong type or it is not installed properly </s>
<s> your system should recognize it automatically </s>
<s> well sometimes people trying to sell ram will send pop ups to your computer telling you you are low on ram </s>
<s> i have 512mb of ram and still see them </s>
<s> if this is an internet sent popup ignore them </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> it is windows giving me a low memory warning </s>
<s> i ve tryed switching te slots and leaving one out i still get 128k no matter what i do </s>
<s> just a guess but i was once told that not all ram fits in all motherboards </s>
<s> did you consult you mboard website for recommended brands of memory </s>
<s> might be a conflict there </s>
<s> in the interim try shutting down any mem resident programs you don t need </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> thanks for the help everyone </s>
<s> i tryed booting up with only the 256 in both slots and it won t boot </s>
<s> so my guess is the ram is bad or doesn t work with my motherboard </s>
<s> crucial com says the density might be wrong and that the motherboard is picky about its ram </s>
