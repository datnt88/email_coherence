<s> i ve been out of the hardware game for awhile now recently bought a new desktop from dell </s>

<s> question is am i able to install the other one and gain anything from it </s>
<s> i m currently using one monitor 42 quot lcd but would soon like to switch to dual 22 quot s thanks in advance </s>
<s> sli is you might wish to contact the card manufacturer directly on this one </s>
<s> there are some other issues surrounding these as well like power supply support for sli </s>
<s> this thread untracked </s>
<s> its called crossfire which is ati tech nvidia uses sli </s>
<s> this makes the cards work together to improve peformance for dual monitors though its not used </s>
<s> to use crossfire in your case you need a motherboard which supports it and has two pci express slots available </s>
