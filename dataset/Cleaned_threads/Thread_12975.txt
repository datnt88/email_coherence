<s> hi there i have reluctantly upgraded to vista home premium the new computer came with it </s>
<s> i have been having constant quot hardware quot bluscreen events </s>
<s> my supplier has changed everything but the box 3 5 disc reader and card reader yet this problem still occurs </s>
<s> if you google quot bluescreen vista quot it seems it is a common problem with several advertisers offering quick fixes </s>
<s> microsoft will not help as it is not a problem they will admit to </s>
<s> how do i make me computer reliable </s>
<s> thanks and regards dunlor </s>
<s> i have a two year old hp media center computer </s>
<s> i ran out and purchaed the windows vista home upgrade the day it came out </s>
<s> so far the only issues that i ve had are compatibility issues drivers software etc </s>
<s> i ve not had any blue screen events no error messages nothing like that </s>
<s> i ve restored media center a couple of times but i always go back to vista </s>
<s> i like the way it looks and my computer seems to boot up faster </s>
<s> sounds like your issues could be the computer itself out of the box </s>
<s> you neglected small details such as the bios version hp s patches to run vista so i can t tell if you ve done it all </s>
