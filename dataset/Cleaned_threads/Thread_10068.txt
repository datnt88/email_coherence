<s> purchased a dvi cable from newegg back in august 2006 for my nec multisync flat panel monitor which worked fine </s>
<s> recently i had to disassemble everything as we were having some work done around the house </s>
<s> now i go to put everything back together and low and behold the dvi cable is missing </s>
<s> as best as i can recall my monitor has a female port in case that matters in terms of what kind of cable i purchase </s>
<s> i d buy the same one but it s been so long newegg doesn t carry it anymore </s>
<s> does it matter which dvi cable i purchase </s>
<s> what should i be looking for </s>
<s> any suggestions on where what to look at </s>
<s> i m looking to resolve this asap as i have no computer access while this issue lingers </s>

<s> fingers crossed that all works out well </s>
