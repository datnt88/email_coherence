<s> re hey old buddy new 450 watt ps ws delivered today </s>
<s> installed same and my old odd noise is gone </s>
<s> of course this supply has 2 fans so now listening to a bit more quot whoosh quot noise </s>
<s> but this is totally acceptable compared to what i had been hearing so ps did fix my problem </s>
<s> just wanted to let you know </s>
<s> and am happy for your quieter computing </s>
<s> here sa link to a post by robert proffitt </s>
<s> keep it in mind if things recur </s>
<s> the result of bad capacitors on a mobo can increase the magnitude of the noise ac current being absorbed by the caps in the power supply and eventually cause them to overheat and fail </s>
<s> i am glad this his shop found this </s>
<s> may be of interest to some </s>
<s> after removing old ps unit popped the top and found no bulging or leaking electrolytics but did see a resistor about 2 watt job that the coating enamel ceramic i don t know had fallen off in a little pile around the resistor </s>
<s> makes me guess the thing had been overheating </s>
<s> anyway the note i wanted to make is that i scavenged the fan from the supply ball bearing job spliced in a connector from my pile of other dead things and now have a new case fan </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> actually this computer only came with a hsf and the ps fan </s>
<s> no case fans </s>
<s> wasn t running hot in the first place about 30 degrees c but now running at 26 icicles are starting to form </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> in the shop i used to work at i allways sallvaged all fans from ps and still do and use as case fans most run for ever </s>
<s> sure sounds as if the resistor had been overheating possibly localized lack of airflow near it altough they can really run hot </s>
<s> wonder what it for </s>
<s> glad that there were no bad caps </s>
