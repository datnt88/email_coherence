<s> i could not find a specific forum for video graphic card so here it goes </s>
<s> i am thinking about upgrading my graphic card to a sapphire radeon hd 3850 agp card </s>
<s> on its web site it states the power supply requirement is 450w </s>
<s> the current power supply on board is only 400w </s>
<s> so i am wondering if the power supply requirement is quot sticky quot or if there s any room to wiggle </s>
<s> has anybody quot exceeded quot the power supply requirement and experienced trouble with their machine </s>
<s> i certainly don t want to upgrade the video card then have to upgrade my power supply after </s>
<s> but it all comes down to amps per rail and we have to get very technical </s>
<s> and to head off any question you get to find the numbers </s>
<s> that said i am running an old agp his another maker ati 3650 512mb on a 230 watt psu </s>
<s> the entire box averages 140 watts on a watt meter so i m just there </s>
<s> i don t suggest anyone exceed the 50 mark </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> unless you re willing to upgrade the psu too </s>
<s> some indicate psus deteriorate over time so if your psu is not new it may be further below the spec than 50 watts </s>
<s> make sure to note what connectors the gpu requires so you have the right psu support </s>
<s> mfg specs state quot 450watt or greater power supply with 30amps on 12 volt with 2x4 power connector recommended quot vapcmd </s>
<s> so your power supply is only 230w and it s running the 3650 card which uses 140w of that power alone </s>
<s> the entire system is drawing that much </s>
<s> i have the advantage of being equipped with watt and amp meters so i can measure what s going on </s>
<s> i also have the 3650 and not the 3850 not many will trouble themselves to measure watts and amps so can t do this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hello there donot worry about the power supply too much if you donot overclock or if you are not a hardcore gamer to the core in this link here you can calculate the power requirement it works good </s>
<s> but power supplies never run at there stated power and realistically you only get about 85 efficiency of that number </s>
<s> so keep that in mind </s>
<s> also stock psu s typically do not come with the 2 4 pin connectors </s>
<s> they barely come with sata power </s>
<s> you can easily pick up psu s cheap these days so it may be within your means to pick one up with your card </s>
<s> that way you pave the way for future upgrades </s>
<s> also if it s a stock dell i do not recommend adding an aftermarket psu as dell has been known for it s proprietary hardware </s>
<s> but it s definitely lower for run of the mill psus and older aging psus </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> well this is more than sufficient and its on sale at my site for 80 </s>
<s> its perfect even if you will be upgrading down the line take a look the apevia atx as680w bl 680w power supply </s>
