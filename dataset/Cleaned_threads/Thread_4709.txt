<s> i m planning to buy a 24 monitor </s>
<s> i ll mainly use the display to work with text internet and for movies </s>
<s> much less for games so far i have too weak hardware although this may change </s>
<s> is important for me that the monitor had a d sub only such i have in my notebook and dvi </s>
<s> i considered benq led gl2450hm philips 247e3lphsu and acer g245habid </s>
<s> however i met with an advice that it is better to look around for a ips panel </s>
<s> i drew attention on the 23 lg ips235v bn iiyama prolite xb2374hds and dell u2312hm </s>
<s> i noticed that these three gather the most positive reviews but which to choose </s>
<s> and whether it s worth buying one inch smaller display but with ips panel or maybe 24 tn </s>
<s> have you looked at what samsung has to offer </s>
<s> it has dvd d hdmi and d sub connections </s>
