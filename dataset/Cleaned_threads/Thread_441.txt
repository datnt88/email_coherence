<s> i am trying to help a friend who recently got 2 surplus dell computers that were used in a school </s>
<s> they are running windows 98 and have 512 ram 20 gig hard drives and if i remember correctly are running 1 gig celeron processors </s>
<s> her intended use is for the kids 5 12 to be able to play their cd based games on so i think the machines are sufficient as many of the games are older and wouldn t run on a newer os anyway </s>
<s> her problem is that someone at the school where they were used set them up quot kid proof quot </s>
<s> that is every time the system powers up it is the same </s>
<s> it doesn t matter what you install or delete or any other changes that you make it always comes back the same </s>
<s> as you can imagine this is somewhat frustrating to the kids as their games and scores are all gone </s>
<s> i suspect that there is hidden program somewhere that is doing this but i have no idea where to begin to look and am not sure i would know if i found it </s>
<s> any suggestions or pointers would be greatly appreciated </s>

<s> as you can imagine this is somewhat frustrating to the kids as their games and scores are all gone quot such freeze programs are made to be nearly impossible to remove </s>
<s> so i just wipe the drive and reinstall windows </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i thought about doing that but she would then need to purchase an operating system which would kinda defeat the whole cheap computer thing </s>
<s> not yet </s>
<s> and without your install cd you don t have a clear license to use this os </s>
<s> sorry but it looks like this can only be cheap if you install linux </s>
