<s> i have an 2007 netgear router wgt624 and tried to do a firmware upgrade via the router s admin page via browser on a macbookpro 10 6 8 </s>
<s> the upgrade failed and bricked the router </s>
<s> the wifi light failed to be light indicating failure as well </s>
<s> its ip address is no longer 192 168 0 1 but another one </s>
<s> the router cannot be accessed via ethernet cable by both my mac os or windows via boot camp </s>
<s> the factory reset did not help </s>
<s> finally the tech support admitted that their routers cannot be managed by mac and i should not have upgraded the firmware using a mac </s>
<s> they failed to suggest 1 a way to flash the rom with a corrected firmware 2 to take it back for repair or give me voucher for a new router </s>
<s> given the price of new routers the wgt is surely obsolete and now unsuable </s>
<s> i was dismayed by netgear s software failure to detect a mac users and give an error message or warning </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> alain </s>
<s> 1 if you brick it they only can replace it </s>
<s> no user method to resurrect it </s>
<s> 2 oh yes there is a way </s>
<s> 3 reality </s>
<s> a new router may be the cheap exit </s>
<s> maybe someone will buy your bricked router </s>

<s> thanks for the suggestions and comments </s>
<s> since i have nothing to lose i will try the australian solution </s>
<s> i am challenged by the prospect to resurrect it </s>
<s> lt div gt i could not believe my eyes that the problem first surfaced in 2006 and netgear never fixed its firmware upgrade after the bricking of their routers </s>
<s> what amazes me is that 2011 tech support somewhere in asia probably the philippines by the names of their staff could not identify the issue on the first email no voice or chat support since i was out of warranty </s>
<s> any suggestions on a reliable new router brand or model </s>
<s> i already own a few apple mushroom time capsule and express and a still working netgear as well </s>
<s> thanks lt div gt lt div gt lt div gt </s>
<s> this issue looks to be mostly on older units </s>
<s> while i do know why they can t fix this with a firmware update that s something i d discuss in a seminar or over a lunch with other software engineers </s>
<s> no excuse but all makers have products that can be bricked </s>
