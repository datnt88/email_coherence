<s> computer specs sony vaio windows xp pro p4 at 1 5ghz 128mb rdram 60g hd i am having trouble with the computer first off for some reason one day the mouse or keyboard stop working so i tried a different mouse and keyboard with no luck there are 2 usb ports in the front and one in the back it was plugged into the usb ports i also tried the other old port also i think its called the serial com port </s>
<s> but still no luck then i tried resetting the bios by taking out the battery on the motherboard but once i turn the computer back on the main bios screen came on but since i cant use the keyboard to escape out of the bois i cant get into windows now i am stuck in the bois screen i also tried buying a pci 2 0 usb card but i cant install it since i cant get in windows to install the driver any help please </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> sadly if the ports are dead and other ps2 and usb keyboards fail then i look to transfering what parts i can into a new box with another compatible motherboard </s>
<s> it s out of stock but 423 socket boards can be cheap </s>
<s> then you get a new case and start moving it </s>
<s> the os hopefully will run on worst case will have to be obtained and installed </s>
<s> do some checks to see what sony wants for repair and then how much for motherboard case powersupply and maybe an operating system </s>
<s> best of luck bob </s>
<s> hey r proffitt sony wants 400 just for the motherboard i can t deal with that are you sure its a 423 socket board for this computer </s>
<s> cause im planning to just buy a motherboard like sony s pcv rx model and just use all the other parts like processor and such from sony on the new board </s>
<s> you can use google com to research what a 423 socket cpu looks like as well as a 478 socket cpu </s>
<s> then you can answer that question </s>
<s> you post is all i know of your machine s failure </s>
<s> since you ve tried the other ports with known good keyboards 400 is far too much for this repair </s>
<s> you can find boards galore for 99 bucks </s>
<s> i wouldn t do this </s>
<s> 400 gets a new box with xp there are many more out there like this and frankly that repair price is a _____ pick a word </s>
