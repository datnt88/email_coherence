<s> i require a cpu for my gigabyte ga 7vaxp computer it needs to be at least over a 3 0 ghz at least and needs to clock at the same as a 3 ghz pentium 4 i ve looked at the documentation for my mobo but it only list amd cpu s and there aren t many that are fast i d search in google but i can t get accurate results and am not sure what to type in </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i had that setup some time ago </s>
<s> you do have a dated system and yes its amd cpu based </s>
<s> no you can t install a intel cpu </s>
<s> in other words your system mtrbd </s>
<s> is old and supports only amd cpus </s>
<s> and that is all it will do plus the amd cpus you may need to get the best out it are historical </s>
<s> you have to look in ebay craigslist etc </s>
<s> to find anything that may work or used period </s>
<s> you ll be better served if you stop any major upgrades and get your hands on a newer mtrbd it needn t be actually new but better h w wise to accept intel cpu you want that </s>
<s> and be open to what you want to do </s>
<s> find a intel based mtrbd </s>
<s> that has 775 socket to accept p4 single core as your best bet </s>
<s> otherwise dual core mtrbds </s>
<s> are the next step up and far more capable than a plain p4 and able to grow abit too </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> yeah i was thinking of buying a new mobo and its funny because i found one already but i wanted to know if my current one was capable of what i asked </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> socket a athlon xp athlon duron if you can find one </s>
<s> i doubt it would meet your specification </s>
<s> there was never a socket a cpu that came close to your requirements </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ga 7vaxp is very old </s>
<s> i think you want to buy a new motherboard </s>
