<s> hi i have an hp a1600n computer with 2gb ram upgraded 1gb and an athlon x2 3800 2 0 ghz processor </s>
<s> i use the computer for video editing and gaming </s>
<s> i d like to get a faster processor but i had some questions </s>
<s> i m looking to spend under or around 200 </s>
<s> since i m already using an amd processor will an intel one not work with my computer </s>
<s> what processor would be best for video editing </s>
<s> will single core be just as good as dual becauase i m not multitasking </s>
<s> thanks so much for the help </s>
<s> no an intel one wouldn t work as the sockets would be different </s>
<s> heck there are even some amd processors that won t work with your own set up since there are different sockets for different families of cpus which is how the cpu plugs into the motherboard </s>
<s> i would suggest looking up which socket am2 or 939 being the most likely that your computer has and then getting the best for that </s>
<s> looking up that model it seems you have an am2 socket so you could go to newegg com or somewhere similar and look for am2 processors </s>
<s> there is an amd athlon 64 x2 6000 windsor 3 0ghz for 229 99 if you want one of the top ones </s>
<s> i d suggest a dual core since while you may think you aren t multi tasking how sure are you that there aren t services running the background taking up resources </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> here s why 1 if you buy a pentium processor than you ll have to fork out for a new mother board to put that processor on </s>
<s> the one and only pentium processor i ever had blew and when i went to replace it i couldn t find a pentium of the same type </s>
<s> since i had to get it done in a big hurry as in fast </s>
<s> i was smack dab in the middle of an online college course at the time i went ahead and switched back to amd </s>
<s> the mother board the pentium was on was incompatible with amd </s>
<s> so i had to spend over 350 for both </s>
<s> this was in 2003 </s>
<s> 2 imho amd is much better in quality than pentium </s>
<s> in the past and since i always had amds up to the point i tried that pentium that didn t even last a year </s>
<s> all my puters now have amds in them </s>
<s> i m presently using the one i replaced the cpu and mb in and the others are being stored </s>
<s> none of them have any problems </s>
<s> now my roomie has an older pentium 4 my amd is quot equivalent quot to a pentium 3 my puter runs at least three times faster than theirs </s>
<s> those are only a couple of reason why i will continue to stick with amd </s>
<s> you can find amds that are compatible with your mb that will give you what you re after </s>
<s> just go to your local computer retailer repair shop tell them what mb you have and what you want to do with it what your budget is etc </s>
<s> and they ll be able to fix you up with what you need </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> sounds like i might as well stick with amd </s>
<s> how can i find out what motherboard i have and is there somewhere i can look online to see what processors will work with my motherboard </s>
<s> if there isn t an easy way i ll just go to my local computer shop </s>
<s> the athlon x2 6000 looks ok little more than i wanted to spend but i ll just save longer </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> cpu z is one of a number of programs to get that information off your computer </s>
<s> amd athlon 64 x2 5600 windsor 2 8ghz item n82e16819103771 for 179 99 is a bit cheaper if you want to come down a notch </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> the easiest way to find out is to install a program called belarc advisor and run it </s>
<s> it will tell you everything about your computer and the system running on it </s>
<s> find belarc advisor free here in cnet s dowload section </s>
<s> if the puter itself is inoperable then one must open it up and look at the board to find out what it is </s>
<s> however if your puter is still under warrenty opening it yourself will void that warrenty </s>
<s> contact the manufacturer tell the make model and serial number to see if they can tell you </s>
<s> they should be able to do this for you </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> if you go to hp com click on support and enter your computer model it will take you to the support page for that model </s>
<s> if you go to specifications it will tell you what socket is used for the cpu </s>
<s> hp is notorious for using of sizes that are not standard </s>
<s> for instant my hp pavilion 750 uses a mobile processor but it does say that it is a 775 socket so i should be able to purchase any processor that will run on that socket </s>
<s> most online computer stores such as newegg and pc connection allow you to search for parts by specifications such as the socket type </s>
<s> also if it is an intel socket you can only use intel processors </s>
