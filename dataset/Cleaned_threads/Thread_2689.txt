<s> i am trying to build a computer for the first time and i am confused about the jumper config on my intel d865perl mobo </s>
<s> in order to route speaker to back panel the manual says to place jumpers in 3 locations </s>
<s> i also need to place jumpers on 2 locations for my bios </s>
<s> my board came with 3 little blue plastic things already placed on some of these locations not the correct ones according to the manual </s>
<s> my problem is that i have removed them and i forgot how they were installed </s>
<s> on one side of the plastic thing is 2 holes and on the other is 3 holes </s>
<s> it seems to fit both ways </s>
<s> which way is correct </s>
<s> also the board only came with 3 and according to the manual i need 5 can someone please tell me if i am missing something here or where i can obtain more of these little plastic things </s>
<s> thank you in advance </s>
<s> mike </s>
<s> ok after reviewing the manual for my mobo and looking at the intel web site i am even more confused </s>
<s> the site says that i only need to set 3 jumpers while the manual says 5 ive double checked and the manual i have is correct d865perl </s>
<s> the website makes more sense as my mobo only came with 3 jumper blocks or whatever they are called </s>
<s> please help clarify </s>
<s> the manual should explain what you need to know </s>
<s> the blue thingees are the quot jumpers quot just configure to the way you want the audio connected or setup </s>
<s> look at the picture graphic in manual and quot usually quot the way they show it is the default setting </s>
<s> why you moved other jumpers for the audio portion doesn t make sense </s>
<s> in other words quot just what are you trying to do quot </s>
<s> for what you want </s>
<s> my experience has shown the latest info is gotten from the website so d l the new manual or help guide and use that </s>
<s> just be sure you re reading the guide for the proper mtrbd </s>
<s> model </s>
<s> the jumper itself connects two pins use the side that has two holes </s>
<s> unlss intel is using some new jumper i suggest to proceed with common sense </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
