<s> i have a mac mini running os x and for ages i have been using an external drive for transferring pictures and videos between friends and family and for backups of a few documents for work etc </s>
<s> i have never had any trouble using the drive and it has always worked ok the drive is an unknown brand but for a few years it has worked with no problems </s>
<s> i took the drive round to my girlfriends house to transfer some pictures and i lost my cable somewhere between my house and hers </s>
<s> the cable supplied with the drive was a usb 2 0 and went from usb a male one end to 2x usb a male on the other end </s>
<s> one of which i would use to transfer files over </s>
<s> the other just seemed useless and i never plugged it in to any usb port </s>
<s> i replaced the cable with a single usb 2 0 cable and the drive powered up all lights flashing but nothing appeared on screen </s>
<s> i tried it on my housemates laptop and my brothers laptop both running windows vista </s>
<s> the laptops both installed drivers and told me that everything was ok good to go but then nothing appeared on those either </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea what is wrong with the hard drive </s>
<s> i assume it is the type of cable that i have bought as it was working fine before i lost the cable and replaced it with a single usb lead </s>
<s> any advice would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks to anyone who can help out </s>

<s> if via usb you ll need a power source or the right usb cable </s>
<s> this can confuse some since it might power up but fail when used </s>

<s> isn t usb already powered </s>
<s> the hard drive isn t seperately powered and only uses 1 cable </s>
<s> are there different types of usb cable i am unaware of </s>
<s> one usb port is only 500 milliamps and every drive i see needs a little more than that </s>
<s> so that is they they had two usb connections </s>
<s> i think you found the cause </s>
