<s> just curious what cpu based upon the cpu s out there now would run vista faster better etc </s>
<s> an athlon fx x2 or an intel core duo </s>
<s> i am definitely not going with vista for at least a year or so after it s release i know what the hardware requirements are now for vista and was just curious </s>
<s> all opinions are respected and appreciated </s>
<s> rocco </s>
<s> if u need a cpu for vista this second i sugest go with the x2 but if u can wait for a few months </s>
<s> go for conroe that is even faster than the fx62 </s>
<s> it will cost u a pretty penny but it will be worth it </s>
<s> as for the x2 don t go for anything lower than a 4200 </s>
<s> 4400x2 is recomended </s>
<s> i m personally in the middle of building an x2 4200 system </s>
<s> if i was going to go with a 4400 but since the am2 versions are no longer being made sold i m stuck going cheaper since i capped my own price </s>
<s> anyway enough about me </s>
<s> i agree with the other guy </s>
<s> if you can wait a good 3 4 months i d build a core 2 duo core 2 extreme based system </s>
<s> it will be expensive but as of right now the most expensive chip will still be cheaper then the afforementioned fx 62 by around 300 </s>
<s> it will also destroy the fx 62 </s>
<s> of course if you re like me and you want to build something immediately go with an amd processor of your choosing whether it be fx or x2 </s>
<s> and i d also go with an am2 socket processor just so you can upgrade down the line if you need to </s>
<s> ddr2 667mhz memory runs about the same speed as ddr 400mhz so there s plenty of good memory if you need it for cheap </s>
<s> just make sure you have a graphics card capable of jumping through hoops if you re wanting all the fancy effects of vista </s>
<s> if you can wait and have the extra cash then go with the core duo 2 becuase it seems to be the best deal at the moment </s>
<s> right now it s the x2 </s>
<s> as for the video card the minimum requirements i found is a geforce fx 5200 radeon 9550 or radeon x300 </s>
<s> i am not going to build one now or in the next month or so but i was just curious about what cpu might be the best right now considering that vista will be 64 bit and the virtual ocean of cpu options </s>
<s> i am not a gamer so i won t need a top of the line system but i do have a level of performance that i expect from my pc </s>
<s> right now i have an athlon64 3200 with 1gig of pc3200 ram and a 128mb agp 8x video card </s>
<s> i would like to experience the next level of performance in the next year or so being as my system is only about 1 year old now </s>
<s> thanks much for the opinions and recommendations </s>
<s> ciao rocco </s>
