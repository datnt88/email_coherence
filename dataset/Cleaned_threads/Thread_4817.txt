<s> hello first of all i would like to apologize if mu questions seem silly </s>
<s> i have been into computers for a long time but now that winter break is coming and i have some time to play games i am ready to upgrade my computer </s>
<s> i just bought a 24inch monitor and would like a video card that would make it look pretty </s>
<s> first of all this is the computer that i have sony vaio vgc rb30 with following specs listed on this website i did upgrade my memory i have 1 5 gigs </s>
<s> i also have a geforce pci card in there but its kind of old 512mb i believe its 6800 </s>
<s> i was looking to upgrade it to either geforce 8800 gtx radeon 4850 or geforce 9800 gtx </s>
<s> i do not know if my power supply would allow for those and if it does not what are my options </s>
<s> also with my previous radeon card i had problem of overheating </s>
<s> i think my tower does not have good cooling system </s>
<s> i did install two extra fans but one went dead so when i play i have to place an outside big home fan by the computer </s>
<s> i would also like to purchase a video card that i could transfer to a new computer when i have money to buy it </s>
<s> for right now though i just want an upgrade </s>
<s> please let me know what i should do </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i forgot to say that i would be willing to change the tower if it someone thinks its possible </s>
<s> i do need a better cooling tower with a bigger supply </s>
<s> my question is though how hard is it to change towers and which tower would my motherboard and other things fit into </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> good work that would make your desk proud </s>
<s> if you have heat issues you must get a new case </s>
<s> as for the power supply you will need a new one get around a 500 watt but try to get over just to be safe you wont need more then 750 watts </s>
<s> it is easy to swap out components from the old case unless sony is annoying and built it so you can t take the stuff out </s>
<s> here are a couple things i recommend </s>
<s> cases it doesn t really matter just get lots of fans but it looks like you have a micro atx mobo so be sure your case is compatible with that here are some good ones power supplies get one with 80 or higher efficiency graphics you only have a pcix16 so you can get a pci 2 0 card but you wont get the full potential i hope this helps and fits your expectations sorry for making it so long </s>
