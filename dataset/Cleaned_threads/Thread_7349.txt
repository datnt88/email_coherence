<s> i am trying water cooling for the first time and something weird is happening </s>
<s> my loop is working fine and i am using a t line to fill it </s>
<s> it is full and almost bubble free however when i turn the pump off the water level rises a little bit in the filling tube </s>
<s> does anyone know why the water level might rise when i turn the pump off </s>
<s> 1 when the pump is on something is expanding in volume a little </s>
<s> normal for plastics and tubing </s>
<s> 2 water is not compressible let s accept that for a moment but there is some note from you that it s almost bubble free so any bubble can be compressed </s>
<s> are you fretting over this a bit too much </s>
<s> i mean does it work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well the loop is quot working quot but it is also not cooling very well </s>
<s> in fact it is cooling the same as my air setup </s>
<s> the water coming out of the radiator feels just as hot as the water going in </s>
<s> might this be due to air bubbles </s>
<s> it s the heat connection from the cpu to the whatever it is parts </s>
<s> remember there are no part numbers pictures or numbers here </s>
<s> one member had a cpu at 30c and was concerned when a new cooler didn t make it cooler </s>
<s> hard to tell them it was fine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my load temp on both air and cooling is 61c 2which is hot for a phenom ii </s>
<s> i am using an ocz hydroflow cpublock a swiftech 120mm fan and my pump is a dangerden cpx pro </s>
<s> my old air cooler was a coolermaster hyper 212 plus </s>
<s> i don t think it is the connection to the waterblock because it feels hot which would imply that heat is being transferred </s>
<s> no pictures means no one can check your work </s>
<s> if the water is getting to 61c then it s the cooler portion that needs work </s>
<s> basic understanding of heat transfer is needed </s>
<s> but no pictures means folk can only guess the water is hot but the cooler is not where air can flow </s>
