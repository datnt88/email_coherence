<s> i m using an epson stylus d88 on winxp i have some images i need to print by tomorrow but the black ink cartridge has run out even though the images have no black in them the printer will not accept the files for printing because the black ink needs replacing when this happened before i was given the option of switching to another mode where colours are combined to print any black content but i can t figure out how to set my printer to do this </s>
<s> is there anyway i can over ride the printers settings and get it to print red and blue images regardless of the fact the black cartridge is empty </s>
<s> of course i could just get the black ink but it s sunday evening and i need the documents to be ready tomorrow morning </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> most printers count the pages and then decide the cartrige is empty </s>
<s> you might try removing the cartrige and putting it back then tell the printer you put in a new one </s>
<s> wayne wrinkles only go where smiles have been jb click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about telephones internet connections spyware removal and download free software </s>
<s> i was handling a epson stylus 400 about 6 years ago and it had an option of synthesizing black from the 3 colors </s>
<s> if i remember right this option was available in the epson icon on the control panel </s>
<s> of course it was an win95 os </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> i do not have an epson so i am not too sure but at printer s properties is there an option for auto detect of color or manual detect </s>
<s> or you may be able to shut down ink level monitoring or you can try removing the black ink catridge reboot put it back in go to maintenance and reset the counter </s>
