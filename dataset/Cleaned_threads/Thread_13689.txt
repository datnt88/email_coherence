<s> hello all i was just wondering which filesystem is best for dvd burning </s>
<s> cdburnerxp pro offers 3 files systems namely joliet iso level 1 and iso level 2 i found from wikipedia that joliet is microsoft endorsed file system but if i am making dvd back ups which file system i should go for </s>
<s> that will run on pc mac as well as linux </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
<s> seems to me that would be best </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> sorry i am not very clear with the answer </s>
<s> i use dvd r to backup mainly documents and pictures </s>
<s> you wrote quot i am making dvd back ups quot which could mean you are making a copy of some dvd </s>
<s> if so you should keep the same filesystem </s>
<s> however for a new dvd recordable media if you want it to be read in windows xp all the types listed do work </s>
<s> you ll discover very fast about filename limitations in iso 1 and 2 but all will work just fine for file backup </s>
<s> there are some that will overanalyze but those are best shown the link to google com bob </s>
<s> my apologies for wrong terminology </s>
<s> so the major difference in all these file systems is only possibility of long file names nothing else </s>
<s> or nothing else major that i should be worrying about right </s>
<s> just making myself sure </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> when you selected iso 1 and then added files you would have learned quickly the limitations </s>
<s> but some want to know ahead of time </s>
<s> be aware i avoid duplicating ready and easy to find web content </s>
<s> i will not tell you what these limitations are but that if you had tried you would have found them without having to record on the media </s>
