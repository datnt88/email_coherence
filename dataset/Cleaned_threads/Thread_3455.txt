<s> i m looking for an easy to use moderately price external hard drive 80gb usb to serve as a backup device </s>
<s> do experienced users here have any specific recommendations </s>
<s> i ve reviewed the different selections listed here but find no reviewer ratings and user ratings are all over the place </s>
<s> thanks much </s>
<s> this fails as a backup on 2 points </s>
<s> 1 no write protect switch </s>
<s> connecting such to an infected system can result in the backup being lost </s>
<s> or operator errors </s>
<s> 2 no backup to the backup </s>
<s> a backup system has multiple copies so that if one fails you go get the next oldest copy </s>
<s> this would be one backup device and no copy to fall back on </s>
<s> if a copy is all you need then such will be fine </s>
<s> but you won t see me put my lifetime digital photo collection at rish on such a system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i define quot backup quot as a scheme or plan but not as a device </s>
<s> you develop the plan suitable for your own needs </s>
<s> you must capture the information that is important or even critical </s>
<s> you must determine what might threaten it and take precautions against these etc </s>
<s> you should also have a recovery plan </s>
<s> no backup plan is any more important than is the ability to recover what is lost </s>
<s> once you ve made all these decisions then you get the appropriate hardware software etc </s>
<s> then you get to be diligent in using it </s>
<s> my own scheme involved actual testing of the backup and recovery methods until i tuned them to meet my needs </s>
<s> i was talking to a user a while back about backups </s>
<s> he was telling me about some product he uses and how he backups this and that and this and that sounded good </s>
<s> so i asked have you ever tried to restore using these backups </s>
<s> answer no so i asked how do you know the restore works </s>
<s> answer oh it will work </s>
<s> so i said let s test </s>
<s> wipe the hd and restore </s>
<s> answer subject title </s>
<s> thank you for your insightful response </s>
<s> it s people like you make life miserable for someone trying to ask simple questions on forums like this </s>
<s> thanks for nothing and you might ask yourself the same question you asked me </s>
<s> you have to meet a few people who lost it all to understand that backup is not optional </s>
<s> and a test of the backup is not to wait till its needed </s>
<s> all the respondants want you to never experience the true misery </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> backup s is plural </s>
<s> geez randun i didn t mean anything negative </s>
<s> my post was directed to steve and not you </s>
<s> i think it s great that your on the backup route </s>
<s> you can learn from all the mistakes that others have made or do it the hard way and make all the same mistakes on your own </s>
<s> i was just trying to point out that there are two parts to a backup </s>
<s> backup restore you can spend hours daily weekly monthly doing backups only to find that when you need them the restore function does not work </s>
<s> it s a heck of a time to find out the backup compressed the data better than was expected </s>
<s> bummer anyway no slight intended </s>
<s> obviously i ve either mis stated my inquiry or users here simply didn t understand </s>
<s> i ve backed up data for years on my pc to tape drives </s>
<s> i currently use retrospect 6 5 and a seagate tape drive </s>
<s> and yes i do have a backup plan and can restore data at will </s>
<s> now that i ve made that crystal clear does anyone want to actually answer my question and recommend an external hard drive that can replace the tape drive </s>
<s> if you don t have a civil answer please don t bother responding </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i really have no idea what all those guys are rambling about </s>
<s> it should not really matter much which enclosure you buy as long as you make sure the drive within is of high quality </s>
<s> i suggest choose anything with a seagate drive in it as seagate drives now all come with 5 year warranties </s>
<s> as for the enclosure itself these are not really expensive and if the enclosure fails ie not the drive itself within the enclosure you can always get a new enclosure and through the drive in the old one into the newer one </s>
<s> generally you cant go wrong if you purchase the vantec nst 250u2 enclosure with a seagate drive inside </s>
<s> also you cud consider getting a dual layer dvd drive and backup tyo dvd disk which is probably a much better bet and will probably cost u much less </s>
<s> just make sure you get quality dvd disk like verbatim tdk or maxell </s>
<s> good dvd burners include nec 3500a the best sony d22a samsung h 552b </s>
<s> i d used about every one and they all quot work quot </s>
<s> which model is available today </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> until reading your explanation which qualified your knowledge and previous experience it s a bit hard to know where to start and stop </s>
<s> no one here i hope wants to insult a knowledgable person nor do they want to overwhelm a real quot newbie quot with technical garble that only serves to prove their own expertise without really offering help </s>
<s> so a reply to a what seems like a straight forward question can be difficult to tailor to specific needs </s>
<s> what i would advise is that you hope for lots of responses regardless of whether they are on target and pick the ones that suit you best </s>
<s> don t get too flustered </s>
<s> this is a great place to pick some pretty good brains but a bad place to always get succinct answers </s>
<s> as for hd enclosures i would go one of two ways and the rest is up to you </s>
<s> you can purchase external drives already in an enclosure or you can buy the enclosure and drive separately </s>
<s> the latter is what i do </s>
<s> i think the major hd manufactures that you already trust are the best source for drive enclosure packages </s>
<s> i put seagates in my enclosures and feel comfortable saying they are a long time and reliable company </s>
<s> mine run quiet and cool and seagate offers what you need </s>
<s> if i was buying one as a gift or personal use i would not hesitate to buy a seagate with usb2 </s>
<s> please don t let this experience get you down </s>
<s> i had a 40gb maxtor external it went and i can t use any of my spare hds with the usb case i have 2 120 gb maxtor externals both holding the same data normally diconnected i only connect to a pc for read write which has been completely scanned a 120gb internal which is external most of the time holding much of the same data and the same data is scattered around a few more internal hds </s>
<s> i haven t lost any data but it s not easy to find what i m looking for when i want to check on it </s>
<s> system it s not </s>
<s> data bank ok i probably have 10 copies of some files over over overkill but i wouldn t even mention the possibility of cleaning the system up unless somebody knows of a utility which can sort it all out </s>
<s> hah </s>
<s> the number one reason is no write protection </s>
<s> while you mention it s unplugged most of the time without a write protect feature a missed virus or even operator error can wipe the backup out </s>
<s> as such this is not a valid quot backup quot but just a copy </s>
