<s> i have installed 3 brand new 80gb maxtor internal hard drives in my computer </s>
<s> every one of them makes a loud clicking noise like a geiger counter when scanning the registry and files for viruses spyware etc </s>
<s> the last hard drive i installed even makes clicking noises when it s booting up and an hd monitoring application called hdd health shows a t e c </s>
<s> threshold exceeded condition date of 2 15 2005 which indicates the new hd could fail anytime soon </s>
<s> hdd health uses s m a r t </s>
<s> to monitor hard drive soundness </s>
<s> in all three cases it indicated a degradation in seek time performance and a combination of other errors although my pc always booted and ran normally with no detectible glitches </s>
<s> i originally purchased the maxtor hd from an online company but subsequently decided to deal directly with maxtor when the second installed drive made the same loud clicking noises as the first one </s>
<s> a maxtor customer service rep i talked to asked me to put my telephone receiver right up to the pc tower so that he could hear what kind of sounds i was complaining about </s>
<s> he confirmed that the sound was due to a defective hard drive and that i should return it to his company for replacement </s>
<s> well the new hard drive they sent me is even noiser than the two others before it </s>
<s> when i called maxtor about the replacement drive a different customer service rep told me the noise was normal and part of the hard drive s seek process </s>
<s> has anyone had the same experiences with noisy maxtor drives like i described </s>
<s> is this normal for all maxtor internal hds </s>
<s> i can t believe the noise is normal because the original ibm h d that came with my dell computer never made any noise at all </s>
<s> should i return the latest maxtor h d for another one which would make it the fourth one or should i try a different brand like western digital </s>
<s> there is a program than allows you to change settings for maxtor drive acoustics </s>
<s> searching the maxtor site i see they no longer offer it for download </s>
<s> info about it can be found at the download link does not work </s>
<s> you may be able to find it still available with a google search </s>
<s> if not contact me through my profile and i can email it to you harv </s>
<s> thanks for your reply to my dilemma brent </s>
<s> however i m more concerned about whether the loud noises are an indication of malfunctioning hds rather than surpressing the noises </s>
<s> have you had any prior experience s with maxtor drives exhibiting loud clicking sounds </s>
<s> is it the nature of their hard drives </s>
<s> the maxtor drive in my 1st dell computer was whisper quiet </s>
<s> others maxtor drives that i ve used since are louder although i wouldn t really say they were overly so </s>
<s> using the maxtor program made them nearly silent </s>
<s> i currently have 4 maxtor drives from 1 3 years old and no failures to date </s>
<s> i also have a wd drive that is louder than my maxtor drives </s>
<s> my opinion is that this is likely an acoustic problem </s>
<s> i ve had no problems with maxtor reliability </s>
<s> although it is strange that you ve had the problem with 3 drives </s>
<s> most of the replacement drives that we get are not maxtor usually western digital because they re cheap </s>
<s> lol we ve had a few maxtors but i ve never had that kind a problem </s>
<s> when booting up or running a defrag some drives will make a slight amount of noise but i sure wouldn t call it a quot clicking quot noise either way since your diagnostics tests are showing problems and you continue to get bad replacements i suggest getting your money back and trying another brand </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> grif </s>
<s> slight noise on boot only </s>
<s> harv it could be a fan noise </s>
<s> have you cleaned them out </s>
<s> grif i ran a diagnostic test suggested by a senior maxtor technician and it indicated there was no hd defect </s>
<s> but why does hdd health keep indicating t e c </s>
<s> date of 2 16 2005 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i used canned air to clean out the interior when i installed the first hd </s>
<s> and the geiger counter clicking sound is definitely not the fan </s>
<s> other than the loud clicks my pc is working fine at the moment </s>
<s> but i am very concerned that the hd will fail again soon as indicated by hdd health s s m a r t </s>
<s> readings </s>
<s> the situation is not very encouraging at all as hdd health the hard disk monitoring application on my pc shows a bad reading 2 for seek time performance including a 59 reading for an unknown attribute resulting in a t e c </s>
<s> date of 2 16 2005 which means eminent hd failure sometime very soon </s>
<s> there really shouldn t be any loud clicking i d return them </s>
<s> grif </s>
<s> my maxtor 60g is very quiet there is a very faint sound when it s being defragged but it s barely noticable </s>
<s> that was the thing that most impressed me about the maxtor when i got it was how quiet it was </s>
<s> i would return it as well </s>
<s> i wouldn t bother placing too much faith in panterasoft s hdd health program s t e c </s>
<s> dates as they tend to change </s>
<s> if you uninstall the application then reboot and reinstall you will normally discover the date has changed </s>
<s> the manufacturer s hard drive utility is most generally a better and more reliable indicator of drive quot health quot </s>
<s> i have several maxtors and for me they are all silent </s>
<s> for others who sit at my computers however the drives are invariably noisy and quot make strange clunking sounds quot </s>
<s> the difference </s>
<s> i can t hear nearly as well as most people </s>
<s> all of my maxtors have been making the same sounds for their entire lives and are still going strong </s>
<s> 7200 rpm drives do tend to be noisier than 5400 rpm drives </s>
<s> vibrations caused by the specific manner in which the drive is mounted can make a difference in sound level also </s>
<s> sometimes the acoustic management utility amset and it can be accessed here will help if the noise level is bothersome </s>
<s> this management tool for ibm will work on maxtors too the noise most people complain about is the seek noise and not the drive bearings as they fear </s>
<s> i have a 160gb and an 80gb maxtor in my system both making a loud fast clicking sound much like a geiger counter </s>
<s> i had a frend tell me that maxtor drives were loud so i put this down to being the price you pay for a cheap drive however having thought about it after reading this post i think you may be onto something with the drives being deffective </s>
<s> in my home there are 3 other systems using maxtor drives 2 only use 40gb drives so i put the lack of noise down to them being so small but the other uses an 80gb and there is never any noise coming from it </s>
<s> however i would not worry to much about it if i were you i ve had my pc for 2 years and the the 80gb the whole time its never failed me except when i murdered my mbr with linux but thats another story and wasn t too difficult to fix thank god for fdisk anyway the 160gb is only 6 months old and still covered under warranty so it it fails i ll get my money back </s>
<s> i would recommend getting another manufacturers drive and maybe pay a little more it ll be worth it in the end </s>
<s> maxtor is to sony as gola is to nike dont worry if you dont know what gola is thats the point </s>
<s> if you can change out the power supply or take any one of your clicking hard drives out and put it into another working pc </s>
<s> although it s possible you can have four bad drives it stretches the imagination more than a bit </s>
<s> i once had a similar problem and it turned out the culprit was a defective power supply that was putting out bogus 12vdc and 5vdc levels </s>
<s> worth a try anyway </s>
<s> do you have enough power is what i am asking </s>
<s> 3 new drives that all click </s>
<s> something doesn t add up </s>
<s> maxtor is well known for being quieter than its competion </s>
<s> another poster said remove one </s>
<s> i would remove two then try it </s>
<s> how new are they </s>
<s> are they new from ebay </s>
<s> drive that were dropped to the ground have little chance of lasting long although they could work for a while </s>
<s> i bought and installed a maxtor diamondmax 10 160gb drive last week </s>
<s> i ve actually removed it and repackaged it to send back to the vendor for testing because the seek noise was so loud </s>
<s> describing it as a geiger counter is an excellent description </s>
<s> its noise while idle is perfectly acceptable but its noise when performing any operation was so similar to that you d get from a knackered old pc that i was very worried i d got a defective product </s>
<s> is there any point in my sending it back if this type of loud clicking is just normal for maxtor s seek noise </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> it s extra obvious to me because i ve put it in a sff cube pc </s>
<s> just read this post and download and make use of the amset utility linked to </s>
<s> consider the utility as the equivalent to oil for hinges if not willing to get and use it the hinge continues to squeak </s>
<s> i have had been using a maxtor hdd 40gb since feb 2001 never noticed any clicking sound as you have described </s>
<s> anyway this hdd had its life two weeks ago could not boot up </s>
<s> i ve replaced it with a seagate 120gb and up running happily if i were you i d return all the maxtor hdds that you ve got and ask for your money back </s>
<s> consider using other brands you can do well without a maxtor </s>
<s> unfortunatly a while back i purchased a maxtor 80 gig quot fluid drive quot hard drive </s>
<s> the information on it read like a sound feature </s>
<s> however from day one i noticed a quot clicking grinding quot noise occasionally coming from my p c </s>
<s> on start up </s>
<s> at the time i had installed several new hardware pieces and thought it was a bad floppy drive </s>
<s> i eventually replaced the floppy only to find that the sound continued </s>
<s> i replaced a second floppy drive and eventually my maxtor hard drive locked up </s>
<s> only then did i realize that the whole time the sound was comming from the new hard drive </s>
<s> maxtor replaced the hard drive at no expense but that didn t help me with the aproximatly 40 gigs of info already recorded on it </s>
<s> my advice if the hard drive is making noise replace it </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> copy and wipe the info off the hard drive first while it s still working before sending it in for replacement </s>
<s> the clicking is normal resulting from head arm movements during seek </s>
<s> all hd s make noises but the maxtors seem to be particularly loud </s>
<s> i installed one in a tivo recently and can hear it from across the room when i fast forward through a recorded show </s>
<s> if it bothers you return the drives and try another brand </s>
<s> if you are just nervous about it signifying impending trouble don t worry </s>
<s> hi harv i have noticed this problem only in the last 4 years </s>
<s> maxtor never used to be this noisy and no hard drive should be </s>
<s> i have had some that last a couple of years but lately they have broke down and destroyed my data </s>
<s> i have now stopped buying maxtor which is a pity as they used to be one of the best they are not the worst though </s>
<s> that goes to fujitsu hard drives they are the worst </s>
<s> western digital are good and i have had no problems so it is a safe bet </s>
<s> so basically i am saying return it for a refund or ask to speak to the manager and tell them you have lost data and wish for an explanation and maybe some kind of insentive for buying them in the future </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> ya in my dell inspiron 2650 whenever i boot up my computer it makes a clicking or beeping noise pretty lowd too but i think its only been doing that since i opened up my computer to replace the keyboard if anybody can help me too </s>
<s> please </s>
<s> why did you open your computer to replace your keyboard </s>
<s> regarding the clicking noises </s>
<s> whenever i had a maxtor hard drive that had a loud clicking or clacking noise the drive failed soon </s>
<s> when the new 7200 rpm drives start up they can make some noise but loud clicking or clacking is not normal </s>
<s> it would seem that the quot smaller quot maxtor harddrives have this noise thing 60g and smaller </s>
<s> i had 4 120g maxtor harddrives 2 made the same clicking noise i sent them to maxtor and they replaced them since then i haven t had the clicking noise at all </s>
<s> i believe that since hard drives are getting cheaper and the manufacturers are trying to still make a profit of course they have cut down on the quality to ensure quantity </s>
<s> it s really too bad that you had 3 fail on you but it doesn t seem all that uncommon </s>
<s> i would suggest contacting maxtor and demanding they not only replace the hard drives but that they replace them with brand new drives they usually send out refurbished ones and the latest models rather than just replacing the same one over and over </s>
<s> they should send you new ones since you ve already replaced them once </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> since the replacement of my 2 failing drives i have had no problems whatso ever and when i requested they be replaced by brand new drives they complied </s>
<s> have used maxtor 80gb 2 years quiet second 80gb 1 year noisy new 120gb 3 months which repeatedly clicked before finally freezing my pc after a few minutes </s>
<s> now back on the original 2x 80gb hdds no problems </s>
<s> maxtor s v4 21 test software reports the new 120gb as error free but i don t trust it so it s next to useless </s>
<s> maxtor won t replace it as i can t give them an error message </s>
<s> result no more maxtor drives for us or our clients in the future </s>
<s> get me once i may try again get me twice shame on me </s>
<s> get me three times i don t think so </s>
<s> i use western digital for past 3 years i have 1 120 gig 3 80 s and 2 40 s not to mention various others 10 under </s>
<s> only one i have ever had a problem with was a real old 850mb back in late 90 s </s>
<s> segate used to be a problem drive too but have now since straightened up </s>
<s> i had a hole stack of them ranging up to 8 gig before i suddenly stopped running into problem ones </s>
<s> so i d try them again on day </s>
<s> so i d try a western digital seagate mabey a samsung hitachi or fujitsu </s>
<s> i d stay away from anything like ibm or some off brand and steer away from maxtor </s>
<s> unless you really like giving them your money </s>
<s> this is just my opinion others may vary </s>
<s> i have worked with a major computer company testing and replacing thousands of hard drives in computers </s>
<s> the clicking sound as described always signifies a deteoriation of the hard drive </s>
<s> it will not take long before it dies in most cases </s>
<s> that is my experience </s>
<s> the age of the drive or the brand doesn t matter </s>
<s> when ibm first to come out with their 120gb hard drive they died even before some of them reached the customers </s>
<s> they were not perfected before they were rushed them unto the market and that clicking sound was evident in some before they died </s>
<s> replace the hard drives </s>
<s> this was also my first thought when i heard about this problem </s>
<s> a defective or under powered power supply can cause all kind of odd problems in a pc from hd problems to video card problems </s>
<s> three failed hard drives in a row is just too much of a coincidence </s>
<s> ken </s>
<s> must be a bad batch from maxtor my 60gb pair 80gb are all ok no noises at all is my report from canada bye retired techie keith </s>
<s> t remember that 10 years ago when my dad as building my family s fisrt computer windows 95 he bought a maxtor hard drive </s>
<s> however there was something wrong with it and he returned it back to maxtor </s>
<s> a few weeks later he recieved his new hard drive from maxtor and everything worked alirite from their after </s>
<s> moral of the story dont buy maxtor out of all the hard drives out their i d say maxtor hd have the most problems </s>
<s> competing hard drive companies like western digital and seagate have much better packaging and are more relible </s>
<s> my old 8gb seagate still works and it even came with a anti static rubber covering of some sort </s>
<s> i have an 80gb western digital hard drive 1 5 years old and its still running strong </s>
<s> it also came packaged with some good software for stuff like reformating and soe tools to examen the hard drive unlike the hitachi ibm hard drive my friend bought </s>
<s> i worked at a compusa store for 4 years and i can tell you one thing </s>
<s> harddrives go bad alot </s>
<s> and while some of you quot savy quot users have had harddrives live 10 years i can tell you that you are the exception rather than the rule </s>
<s> i stood right next to the harddrive department during the time i worked at compusa </s>
<s> during that time i sold hundreds of harddrives sure this doesn t include online buyers but hear me out </s>
<s> the line i heard the most is quot insert brand here of harddrives suck </s>
<s> i hate thier company and i will sue them </s>
<s> i lost all my data </s>
<s> i will never buy one of their harddrives again and i will tell everyone i know not to buy them too </s>
<s> insert other brand here is soo much better </s>
<s> my friend bought them and their computer still works </s>
<s> omg </s>
<s> i should have bought that one quot hehe as you can see most people are really unhappy when their harddrive dies and they lose all their data </s>
<s> but the fact remains harddrives die all the time all brands die </s>
<s> how long will yours live do you ask </s>
<s> well that depends on alot of things how much you use it temperature things like that </s>
<s> the old general quot law quot is every 10 degrees farienheit higher than room temperature and your life of components is halved </s>
<s> the general consensus at the time i worked at compusa was 3 6 years for a harddrive living my experience by customer complaints </s>
<s> that sounds really short but if you think about how long most people keep computers are you really going to keep yours that long </s>
<s> i really doubt it </s>
<s> according to quot the law of accelerating returns quot we will continue to have better and better parts exponentially at cheaper and cheaper prices so i doubt you will keep outdated equipment very long </s>
<s> and if the worst happens you do backup your data right </s>
<s> oh you don t heh well good news you can send your harddrive off to a data recovery service </s>
<s> it s expensive but they can get data off the most dead of dead harddrives </s>
<s> so there can be hope if it is really worth it to you </s>
<s> the question quot do you backup your data quot makes me wonder what to do i read advice that the best way to backup many gb of digital pictures was with an external hard drive for my dell laptop </s>
<s> after the first lacie 250 gb external drive died after 3 months i bought another to back up the first while it was being repaired </s>
<s> it did not seem possible that i could get 2 bad hard drives from one company </s>
<s> well not only is it possible but it happened and now i have two 250 gb lacie hard drives that only occassionally are recognized by windows xp </s>
<s> the problem started long before service pack 2 so that can not be blamed </s>
<s> no one seems to know what the problem is </s>
<s> has anyone else had problems with lacie </s>
<s> they seem to have a band of die hard haters at online retail sites </s>
<s> any solutions </s>
<s> even if lacie can fix these drives i could never use them with any confidence </s>
<s> i recently bought a maxtor 200 gb hd too and found to be quite noisy i have searched and found the amset acoustic management utility and info on it here </s>
<s> i think the best way to backup data right now would be with a dvd burner they have the double layer version now too </s>
<s> blank dvd s are cheap stuff nowadays a dollar maybe and a burner can be had for under 100 i ve heard of lacie but i haven t heard alot about them </s>
<s> i would imagine that lacie doesn t manufacture their own harddrives since i noticed that they make all kinds of things including monitors </s>
<s> odds are there is a seagate on hitachi drive in there </s>
<s> for those of you that didn t know the crt tubes used in regular tube monitors are only made from 4 or so companies </s>
<s> so it isn t really a stretch that lacie doesn t make anything entirely quot from scratch quot as far as if lacie has a seagate drive someone else mentioned seagate being a good brand in this thread but i m not so sure </s>
<s> i remember them being the absolute cheapest drive you could get a few years back </s>
<s> during that time i worked in a computer company that did build to order systems for businesses </s>
<s> they really didn t like seagate because they had complaints about them failing from their customers </s>
<s> but i have nothing against seagate i would probably buy one </s>
<s> i would find it hard to believe that a company would make products exactly the same for years </s>
<s> i mean their engineers have to retire get fired sometime right </s>
<s> lol and anyhow i would rather check the overall sales a drive to compare against any complaints </s>
<s> this may not be the same but you description of the sound lines up </s>
<s> in previous years ibm hard drives made this noise as they sought to recover a dud sector </s>
<s> i was able to fix this by using an ibm utility that spared these bad surface areas and at that time some excess capacity was used to replace these defectives </s>
<s> it might be worth checking with maxtor what happens when defects occurs on the disk surface and what can be done to fix this </s>
<s> my experience with ibm now hitachi was that once the bad areas were hidden the were no problems </s>
<s> i now have hitachi drives with no problems at all </s>
<s> i d suggest running spinrite from gibson research </s>
<s> it will really get down and dirty with the drive refresh all data and sector formatting and look for cross sector bit pattern interactions </s>
<s> by reading the log you ll see how the drive is behaving and whether there are bad sectors that were either recoverable or that had to be mapped out </s>
<s> my experience with clicking in hard drives is that there are low level servo problems that are causing the drive controller to re seek because either the heads are out of alignment or the servo patterns are weak </s>
<s> after all the user data formatting data low level format as well as the servo location data are all stored magnetically on the disk surface </s>
<s> hard drive disk surfaces can grow defects </s>
<s> they typically start off as point defects and owing to galvanic interactions expand over time </s>
<s> if the defect is large enough the drive s ecc won t be able to correct the data any longer or the drive won t be able to find the sector or you get the point </s>
<s> after running spinrite if it still clicks as in multiple seeks per read that s incipient failure no matter how you slice it and no drive price bargain compensates for the loss of important data or for that matter the loss of time spent futzing with the thing reformatting reinstalling os apps data yadda yadda </s>
<s> do you work for 2 00 hour </s>
<s> count how long you spend rebuilding a hard drive and you ll realize that a few dollars saved on a bogus hard drive are gone in a puff when it goes toes up </s>
<s> after spinrite if it still clicks send it back </s>
<s> at least you ll have a spinrite log to prove to maxtor what s going on </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> it is apparently a fact that ibm hard drives are not available </s>
<s> their production was handed over to hitachi who improved them </s>
<s> having used both the ibm and now hitachi i can testify to improvement </s>
<s> i must say that i still have a 30g ibm and it has been running well for many years </s>
<s> seems that maxtor has a problem yes </s>
<s> was it a lack of disk manager software </s>
<s> or was disk failure </s>
<s> i use hitachi hard drives with no problems and quiet and yes they do lack the disk manager software available with wd drives </s>
<s> however they do have a very good free drive fitness test that will recover failed disk surface problems that ultimately occur on drives </s>
<s> having used the ibm hitachi drive fitness test to fix a number of drives actually ibm drives in the past the one focus of fixing is achieved with free software </s>
<s> spinrite is undoubtably better in that it can be a data recovery tool as well </s>
<s> but the cost is us 89 00 to repair a drive is more than a replacement drive for some people </s>
<s> but it is cheap for data recovery </s>
<s> a good combination if you need it </s>
<s> so these guys go and download the amset utility which changes the parameters of the seek travel in the drive so it no longers slams into the stops at the end of the travel or reduces the speed of the motion slightly so the noise is less noticeable </s>
<s> seems to me the manufacturer should have made the drive quiet to begin with </s>
<s> i have a wd 120gb hd and not only can i just barely hear it running but the only time i even hear it seeking is when it is really looking hard for something like during a search </s>
<s> the sound it makes is like a geiger counter but it is so quiet you actually have to have your ear close to the tower to hear it at all </s>
<s> i ve been using western digital drives in my pc all i build </s>
<s> haven t seen a drive yet that had trouble </s>
<s> noteworthy i am guessing here but isn t the maxtor drives you re getting the ata133 ones </s>
<s> if so does your system board support ata133 </s>
<s> i know mine supports up to ata100 in eide mode </s>
<s> wd only has ata100 in eide drives </s>
<s> sata is up to ata150 </s>
<s> my wd drives have all been silent while in operation </s>
<s> only quot click quot i ever hear is on shutdown when the head parks </s>
<s> normal there never a noise while read write </s>
<s> i too have had one hard disk drive from maxtor which has gone faulty </s>
<s> it only seems to be on very recent production models however i have found maxtor to be one of the better customer focused companies and i am sure they will replace the drive for you </s>
<s> i had forgotten that spinrite costs 89 00 for a first time buyer i ve been upgrading since the original spinrite and it only costs 29 to upgrade which is a bargain if you need it in your toolkit especially if you have multiple computers and use it to investigate problems with friends computers </s>
<s> but it s powerful and its diagnosis is well accepted </s>
<s> as what is quot critical quot to one user isn t to a multitude of others </s>
<s> the issue boils down to the simple fact that it is cosmetic and not any actual symptom of problems with the drive </s>
<s> a man bought a rolls and christened it sir churchill with a bottle of french champagne </s>
<s> his neighbor bought a continental and christened it mr lincoln with a bottle of napa valley champagne </s>
<s> another neighbor bought a ford f150 and christened it teddy roosevelt the rough ridin sob with a bottle of pabst blue ribbon </s>
<s> all were satisfied but the f150 is still running strong while the other two spend their lives in critical care facilities </s>
<s> hi a simple answer to your question is yes go with western digital or iomega </s>
<s> i had the same problems with 120g maxtor after only a few weeks i took it back </s>
<s> the seek times are slower also compared to others </s>
<s> i bought mine from fry s electronics </s>

<s> spinrite is a fantastic product if you need to recover unreadable data from a magnetic drive </s>

<s> its never happened before though i ve formatted other drives exactly the same was even the one i m using now an 80 gig wd </s>
<s> i even tried to access these hidden partitions in dos but that didn t fly either </s>
<s> not even with fdisk </s>
<s> so i aggravate myself intentionally sometimes as i look at the maxtor 20 gig with all that stuff on it that i can t recover </s>
<s> zeusman tsmith3680 hotmail com </s>
<s> i ve installed three maxtor 160 gb drives one original and two replacements sent by the company and all have suffered from the same noisy clicking sound when asked to perform a task </s>
<s> the one good thing that i can say about the company is that their customer care team are very good about responding to queries and sending replacements </s>
<s> however when the replacements are just as bad as the originals it kind of takes the edge off it </s>
<s> personally i m not getting a maxtor drive again </s>
<s> i have just lost my samsung 80gig hdd that came in my new hp pavilion only a year and six weeks ago </s>
<s> no clicking no grinding nothing to suggest imminent failure it worked for my husband at 7 00 pm and couldn t find its mbr at 9 30 </s>
<s> i m using spinrite on it at the moment which promised to be a very s l o w process predicting another 2000 hours a few minutes ago but is now going lickety split jumping from 1 complete to 45 in about the last half hour </s>
<s> so i have some hope of data recovery fairly soon but don t know what to do about the drive itself </s>
<s> trash it as unreliable </s>
<s> i started reading this thread because i ve bought an 80gig maxtor but now don t know whether to even unwrap it or return it after all the complaints on this board </s>
<s> i ve been pleased with many maxtor drives over the years but notice they now have 1 year warranty rather than 3 as in the past which makes me doubt </s>
<s> i discovered spinrite back in 88 1988 when we used mfm and rll drives 20 mb hdd and have kept using it since on quot dead quot drives and have had great success with it </s>
<s> gibson really invented a winner with this software as it has recovered several hd s that sounded like coffee grinders </s>
<s> my flatmates maxtor 60 gb was so loud we could hear it seeking from the room next door no clicking just a coffee grinder full of pennies </s>
<s> after running spinrite the noise did not lessen by much but it kept on working for another 8 months with no problems other than bloody loud noises </s>
<s> it was still working fine when it was put into a games server in the back room with the door shut </s>
<s> personally i use seagate drives as they have a 5 year guarantee </s>
<s> 2 120 s sata striped array and a 200 ata </s>
<s> not a sound </s>
<s> i have had maxtor drives forever </s>
<s> the last drive before this 160gb unit was a 40gb </s>
<s> i was surprised that the new drive was way more noisy than the old one </s>
<s> what happens is at times when the drive is doing an access i hear like a clunking sound </s>
<s> at that time i get a pause </s>
<s> a couple of times it has done this mostly when loading windows xp and it has paused for minutes </s>
<s> after looking into it i saw that the ide controller had defaulted to pio mode instead of the proper dma mode 6 which is correct for an ultra dma 133 unit </s>
<s> i have read posts everywhere to try to see what is going on and i am convinced it is some sort of maxtor recent manufacturing problem </s>
<s> what makes me angry is that the fact is most people these days have huge groups of files and just changing out drive is way to time consuming </s>
<s> w all know with windows xp it is worse becasue of the fact you must have the default ide controller drivers installed prior to swap or risk the blue screen of death </s>
<s> in maximun pc magazine there has been recent informamtion on seagate problems as well </s>
<s> my fear and your case confirms it is to get another drive and then go through it all over again </s>
<s> i completely agree </s>
<s> after 4 months my lacie 250 gig hard drive died as well </s>
<s> after a discussion with the company representative who suggested using one data recovery service that would cost about 1800 i found another service who charges a bit less </s>
<s> apparently the 250g drive stresses the components so much which are cheap anyway to keep the price down that these drives are very prone to failure </s>
<s> lacie appears to be apiece of crap in a slick case </s>
<s> gt </s>
<s> a 250gb sata just failed on me within 2 months of purchase of the product </s>
<s> all the data gone </s>
<s> a couple of weeks ago i bought a maxtor 80gb ext hard drive within days of setting it up the light went out </s>
<s> i took it back to the shop and they gave me a replacement immediately no questions asked </s>
<s> on 5th oct i set up the 2nd maxtor 80gb and by the night of the 8th oct i noticed that the light had gone out on it too i returned it to the store on 10th oct and we tried to figure out what it was that i was doing wrong </s>
<s> also we found out that it was the power cord that had malfunctioned and not the actual hard drive unit </s>
<s> the only thing we could think of that maybe i should not have done was to leave the unit plugged into the power 24 7 </s>
<s> it never occurred to me to only turn it on when i wanted to use it </s>
<s> i assumed it would be ok to leave it plugged into the power all the time </s>
<s> there were no such instructions cautioning me on what i should or should not do </s>
<s> i would like to hear from anyone else who has had the same problems or if they think that it is ok or not ok to leave an external hard drive plugged into the power all of the time </s>
<s> on 15 october 2005 i purchased a maxtor one touch ii external 200gb hdd </s>
<s> this purchase was based on previous experience with a maxtor 40gb external hdd and a maxtor 80gb hdd both of which were still functioning perfectly after 4 and 2 years respectively </s>
<s> when i hooked up the 200gb drive it immediately took over the drive letter for the 80gb drive and at the same time the 40gb drive disappeared altogether </s>
<s> i tried to reorganize the drive letter to no avail </s>
<s> i assumed a conflict switched the 80gb over to my other notebook where it was recognized immediately though it was now very sluggish </s>
<s> powered down everything for night assuming it had been a glitch </s>
<s> next morning more errors showed up </s>
<s> drives on all three maxtors were not being recognized and message stated problem was due to an i o device error </s>
<s> separately hooking up each drive to either notebook found the same message </s>
<s> spoke to my workplace info tech and he said this was recent problem that had been found with maxtor one touch </s>
<s> he pulled all the drives out of their casings and was able to get a desktop pc to recognize them with appropriate drive letter but still couldnt open them </s>
<s> found on maxtor knowledge base a description of problem with outside links for help </s>
<s> all 3 maxtors were fat 32 format </s>
<s> seems odd that the maxtor kb states that one of the quot most common reasons is using fat32 as the file system in a windows 2000 or xp system quot as i have been running xp for over 2 years with no problems on the 40 or 80gb hdd </s>
<s> my info tech checked out external links and found getdataback no relation to company or financial incentive the best to salvage my drives </s>
<s> the program can be run without purchase so you can check whether the drive is salvagable </s>
<s> program cost 120 us as i wanted to cover fat32 and ntfs formats </s>
<s> we were able to save almost everything 7 years of thesis work photos financial date </s>
<s> word of caution on getdataback make sure you dont ask to recover files that you had previously deleted on the drive </s>
<s> the 36gb database spiraled to over 400gb before we realized what the problem was </s>
<s> also a separate hdd is required to feed all the recovered data to </s>
<s> i used a drive at work that was unhooked from the network </s>
<s> for now i have a western digital 200 gb external where everything is housed </s>
<s> maxtor 200gb has been returned to vendor and i will never buy another maxtor again </s>
<s> here s a suggestion for windows lacie users </s>
<s> never never ever hot plug a firewire drive no matter what anyone tells you </s>
<s> turn your computer off </s>
<s> i mean hard off power down completely and re boot </s>
<s> connect the drive </s>
<s> turn the computer back on </s>
<s> the drive should be recognized immediately </s>
<s> if it isn t you ve got problems which aren t anything to do with windows or lacie s drives </s>
<s> could be your firewire card </s>
<s> try an adaptec </s>
<s> also firewire 400 is more reliable than firewire 800 and probably as fast as most users will ever need </s>
<s> if you have firewire drives that are always in use just leave them connected </s>
<s> if you have ones that you only use from time to time make sure you turn off and re boot don t just hibernate the computer each time you connect a drive </s>
<s> i used to have this problem all the time </s>
<s> powering off and re booting every time i connect or disconnect a firewire drive totally solved it </s>
<s> once again don t hot plug firewire drives your system won t find them reliably and the chances of shorting the power bus if you plug the cable in at an angle and terminally frying the drive are very high </s>
<s> i spent several years working in a college media production lab and i ve seen this problem again and again </s>
<s> trust me </s>
<s> if you re going to connect or disconnect a firewire drive turn everything off </s>
<s> i cannot emphasize this enough </s>
<s> as for the reliability of lacie s external hard drives they re the drive of choice in many recording studios and video editing suites and are generally among the most reliable external drives available for mission critical media storage applications </s>
<s> i have 3 2 200 gb and 1 250 gb of them connected to my audio video editing workstation </s>
<s> they often run 24 7 for weeks on end </s>
<s> none of them has ever failed me in any way </s>
<s> knock wood </s>
<s> these are the heavy duty d2 models mind you not the slick little porsche ones </s>
<s> i don t know what brand of drive they use in em but they seem to work as advertised </s>
<s> there s always the possibility of lacie manufacturing a run of bad units as the person who s burned out 3 different 250 gb units may have discovered </s>
<s> however most people i know including myself are pretty happy with them </s>
<s> the worst part about the lacie failures is the attitide at lacie </s>
<s> it starts with techs that seem tp know less than the usual uninformed tech and continues right through the possibility of returning the drive </s>
<s> the failure happens early in the warranty and it takes many months of haphazard advice until return seems the only option </s>
<s> the time spent trying to get this done added to more time salvaging data puts you over the one year since date of purchase and that is the end </s>
<s> never mind that your discussion and original complaints were well within the one year </s>
<s> you listened to tech support and dawdled in doing so and therefore tough luck becuase they won t even repair it at that point </s>
<s> however that may be just as well because i would not be able to use any lacie drive even if free after having the double failure </s>
<s> i could never feel any data was safe on the lacie repaired or not </s>
<s> i am having the same problum with one of my hard drives </s>
<s> although i have not contacted any of the manufacturers since it is an old system </s>
<s> the hard drives are maxtor as well </s>
<s> a good brand </s>
<s> but the system is older as i said so i have no need to complain </s>
<s> or get new ones </s>
<s> i ll just use the computer till it dies i suppose </s>
<s> the noise started just recently while running norton antivirus </s>
<s> i don t think it is a normal sound for the drives to do that </s>
<s> i would switch brands and give it a try </s>
<s> after all you wouldn t want to trust that the noise is normal then lose the drive and all of its info </s>
<s> i would go with western digital </s>
<s> i have another computer with two 10 gig hard drives </s>
<s> they work great </s>
<s> i run that system 24 7 never turn it off </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> return maxtor drives </s>
<s> they have had a real bad run of them </s>
<s> the geiger counter seek noise that i have heard some hdds make one was a maxtor and it did fail see details below i have had work pcs with hdds that made the same noise and those did not fail make unknown </s>
<s> my pc supplier went down the pan taking my pc s paid for extended warranty and support with it </s>
<s> my very noisy home pc fans started making intermittent clicking noises for about a month i knew that this might be the signs of an impending hdd failure but i stupidly thought that it might also have been a fan </s>
<s> however because of the intermittent nature of the sounds and the noise of the fans i could not be certain where the sounds were coming from </s>
<s> so i ran a backup but with cds it s such a pain no dvd writer at that time </s>
<s> so i ran hdd diagnostics looked at the hdd smart monitoring software all assured me that no tec was predicted for at least several years well you ve guessed i shouldn t have believed these i still thought it could be a fan doh </s>
<s> and the hdd let me down </s>
<s> do not rely on hdd monitoring software </s>
<s> these utilities may predict a failure but failure to identify any problems does not indicate that no problems are present </s>
<s> the problem was that the mbr of the maxtor diamondmax 16 60 gb hdd in my two year old pc became corrupted and the pc would not boot i think the message was boot disk fail </s>
<s> using the free bart pe based bootable ubcd4win rescue cd a43 explorer i was able to determine that the data was ok however because i had not sufficient confidence in my diagnosis and the consequences of getting it wrong seemed so bad loss of data so i held off mbr repair until a new hdd was installed </s>
<s> then i transferred data and settings to the new hdd using ubcd4win a43 </s>
<s> the hdd was later diagnosed as close to death the actual description was the drive is failing with maxtor powermax utilities from the free dos based yes i know it s really linux ultimatebootcd the bearings are failing my diagnosis based on the sounds that it made </s>
<s> i now know that you can listen to your hdd using a screwdriver or similar object pressed between your ear and the case of the hdd but you will need to extract the hdd from its bay pc switched off while you do this </s>
<s> used in this manner it allows you to listen to the hdd it screens out the airborne noise while conducting the sound to your skull much like a mechanic working on a car engine or a physician s stethoscope </s>
<s> the sound from the bearings isn t loud like the wav file and was completely inaudible above the fan noise but might have been heard in a quiet pc </s>
<s> download the sounds your hdd should never make from exclude the quotes this has led me to believe that there was a dual failure mechanism the bearings could only be heard above the fan noise using the screwdriver method but the clicking sound was clearly audible but since it only occurred every now and then unlike the relevant wav file i was unable to be certain of its origin </s>
<s> normal hdd bearings will be inaudible in an operating pc </s>
<s> if your hdd makes sounds that even remotely resemble these examples mine did you are already neck deep in the smelly brown stuff and the level is rising rapidly </s>
<s> hope this helps pc victim </s>
<s> i am wondering what level of help i could reasonably expect with a drive problem </s>

<s> how do i determine if there is something wrong with either the power connection to the drive or the usb connection to the drive </s>
<s> how far into checking these things out can i expect wd to go </s>
<s> the web page seems to say if the diagniostic tests fail then the drive is bad and they go no further in discussuing how to investigate the real cause of the problem </s>
<s> has anyone had similar problems that were solved </s>
<s> stephen a can you swap the psu </s>
<s> b can you swap the usb cable </s>
<s> c can you remove the hdd from its enclosure </s>
<s> either of the first may resolve the problem </s>
<s> if neither individually or combined help search the forums </s>
<s> otherwise unless wd can help you seem to be stuck with a dead hdd so read on i m guessing that this is most probably a standard hdd housed in an enclosure with power connector led and usb interface if this is the case open the outer enclosure and establish whether you can extract the hdd </s>
<s> if so you might be able to retrieve the data by simply installing it in your pc </s>
<s> please check wd website for instructions based on model number on internal unit </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> stephen please let us know how you get on </s>
<s> as i understand it tec dates are a prediction that critical hdd parameters will exceed a level that are considered to be a sign of impending theoretical failure </s>
<s> however the unreliable nature of tec dates diminishes progressively as the amount of data gathered increases </s>
<s> hence it takes any of these predictive applications time to gather sufficient data for an accurate tec prediction </s>
<s> this is presumably why reinstallation following an install produces different tec predictions since the available data set is smaller after installation than it was previously and hence the prediction is not the same </s>

<s> from my experience wd western digital and maxtor have been great drives during the pre 2gb days </s>
<s> after that seagate took over the reliability contest </s>
<s> nowadays i wouldn t use maxtor worst ibm terrible and wd bad in any of my units </s>
<s> these three would give out those clacking sounds which are an indicative that the drive is about to fail even when new </s>
<s> my 20gb seagates though 4 years old still work though do become slooooow with age </s>
<s> at least they re not clacking </s>
<s> i change them when i notice a degradation in speed </s>
