<s> newer to computers just out of curiosity i m thinking about extra storage and flexibility in the case of something ever going wrong with my computer </s>
<s> i ve looked at internal and external hard drives </s>
<s> if i were to buy an external usb such as an iomega 40gig would it be possible to install windows xp on it and use it as the main hard drive </s>
<s> new to all this stuff </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> it is highly unlikely your motherboard will support booting from a usb device </s>
<s> you would be better off buying a usb hard drive case and getting your own internal drive you will have an option to pick the size and you can swap drives when you want to </s>
<s> xp doesn t provide support for such even if your machine could boot from such </s>
<s> let s call this one a deadend </s>
