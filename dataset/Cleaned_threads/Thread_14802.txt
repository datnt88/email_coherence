<s> i recently added a new maxtor 250 gb with a 16 mb cache internal hard drive as a slave to my existing internal wd 250 gb drive which is the master </s>
<s> the master was left as the c drive and i removed the cd rom drive to make room for the new maxtor which was designated as the d drive </s>
<s> now when i boot up my system the screen tells me to control alternate delete which restarts the system and then i have to go to f2 to get to the startup bios screen </s>
<s> if i choose the quot boot system quot option it takes me to the choice of drives to boot and i then have to choose the wd drive and hit enter in order to get my system to boot successfully </s>
<s> i m not real savy about fooling around with the bios but isn t there something simple that i can do to get my system to boot up normally </s>
<s> when you add a second disk normally the bios does not ask for boot order every time you run the pc </s>
<s> i have 3 hard disks on my computer and my bios does not asks about this because it has not an option about this </s>
<s> check your bios if there is an option that every time you run your pc to ask about boot order </s>
<s> i think that there is an option somewhere in your bios </s>
<s> check it again </s>
<s> make sure the jumpers are in the correct position per the drive s manufacturer </s>
<s> you removed the cd to do this </s>
<s> are the 2 drives on the same cable may not be important but check motherboard manual you may be going at this with bios as problem when your trouble is in the hardwiring </s>
<s> also check if your new drive needs 40 wire or 80 wire ide cable and check the drive s manufacture website faq section to see if the wd and maxtor have history of being incompatible </s>
<s> are the drives partitioned </s>
<s> from what you describe at boot up your system is acting like it wants to be able to dual boot </s>
<s> i think you need to provide more info os model number of hdds and so on </s>
<s> is this a dell system </s>
<s> if it is let me know </s>
<s> i will tell you how to get to recognize the drive </s>
<s> no unfortunately this is a gateway problem </s>
<s> thanks anyway </s>
