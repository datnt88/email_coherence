<s> hi i currently have a fujitsu siemens scaleo p with a motherboard model ga 8i848pm </s>
<s> i have 1 x 512 ddr ram installed and am looking to upgrade this </s>
<s> i believe that the ram i have installed at the moment is pcr 2700 although i can t be sure </s>
<s> i need to know whether i should add another 512 ram another 1gb or take the existing ram out and replace it with 1gb </s>
<s> i am not sure whether there will be a great difference between these 3 options and was hoping someone would help me out with making a decision </s>
<s> i know that my computer does not support duel channel memory </s>
<s> another website suggested that i buy a stick of ram pcr 2300 but i m not sure whether this will be different to buying another pcr 2700 as i have no idea what that actually means </s>
<s> can anyone help out </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> sorry i meant pcr 3200 not 2300 </s>
<s> it should tell you about adding ram and whether it s advantageous to add in pairs or not </s>
<s> many of today s systems are built with dual channel memory architecture which means it is advantageous to add in dimms in pairs 2 512mbs vice 1 1gb </s>
<s> if you download and run cpuz it should tell you what ram you have in your system and whether it s one dimm or two dimms </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> interestingly enough your computer shipped with four different models of motherboards so the motherboard model sure helped </s>
<s> before purchasing please confirm you have two ram slots and not four just in case </s>
<s> if that is correct you can install a 1gb stick of ram if you like with no need to remove the 512mb bumping it up to 1 5gb </s>
<s> you could likewise just insert another 512mb stick to reduce the cost totaling 1gb </s>
<s> as to pc3200 vs pc2700 the higher the number the faster it is generally speaking </s>
<s> you can safely mix and match pc3200 with pc2700 which results in all ram running at the slower of the speeds </s>
<s> ideally you d want all pc3200 but it s better to have 1 5gb running as pc2700 than 1gb running as pc3200 </s>
<s> hope this helps john </s>
<s> yes i have 2 ram slots not four </s>
<s> i think i will do as you suggested and add another 1gb to the spare slot </s>
<s> there will be no difference between purchasing pcr 2700 or 3200 </s>
<s> not even in price </s>
<s> pc2700 runs slower than pc3200 but since you already have a pc2700 stick it doesn t matter which you choose as it would be forced to run at the slower pc2700 speed </s>
<s> as far as price is concerned that varies </s>
<s> there are frequently sales that make pc3200 cheaper than pc2700 or vice versa so just shop around for both and snag the best deal </s>
