<s> i already have the case standard mid atx antec with front firewire usb 2 0 plugs </s>
<s> do i need a certain type of motherboard to be able to connect the front firewire ieee 1394a b </s>
<s> or will all standard mobo s have the pins to connect it correctly </s>
<s> i have been building pc s for a while now so i know all the basics </s>
<s> i m just not sure what to buy for this </s>
<s> is on the front cable </s>
<s> some are simply those that one feeds through the a hole in the rear and plug into the rear connectors </s>
<s> others are the small black connectors that plug into the mobo </s>
<s> when you consider buying a mobo don t you take the time to read what it contains supports </s>
<s> it s all there in black and white or whatever colors you prefer </s>
<s> they even provide pictures and you can even download the manual to read before you consider buying </s>
<s> or go to and read details on all of the motherboards that support the cpu chipset that you are interested in </s>
<s> i always do alot of research before i buy anything </s>
<s> i ve found the motherboards that specifically state that they support frontside ieee 1394 firewire so if it doesn t have the the fire controller it won t work </s>
<s> someone told me that the standard front side connectors on mobo s could support firewire </s>
<s> i don t think that s true but since it came from a usually trustworthy source i thought i would verify this </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> support firewire </s>
<s> you are totally correct to double check i m looking at two right now that do not support it in the front </s>
<s> lot s od usb though </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> mixed up between mobo and case </s>
<s> if the mobo has the firewire pins on the mobo surface it will certainly support firewire in the chipset or a separate chip </s>
<s> and you have a case that supports it so then you will simply enable it in the bios fire wire is slowly becoming a standard along with usb </s>
<s> remember it is a mac development and ms still doesn t acknowledge it </s>
<s> they call it i something </s>
<s> mfrs don t like offending ms lol </s>
<s> i wouldn t get a new mb just to get firewire but just get a firewire pci card </s>
<s> since i have some older atx cases that don t have front usb or firewire ports i got a 5 1 4 quot drive filer that had both the cables go throught the caes out the back and plug into the rear usb and firewire ports </s>
<s> dose the job cost 10 </s>
<s> john </s>
