<s> i make a new form in server properties but when i go into printer properties the form does not show in the list of paper to choose </s>
<s> tractor also says unavailable </s>
<s> any help will be appreciated </s>
<s> and maybe an lq 24 pin model </s>
<s> you ll need to provide your os and whether or not you found a proper driver for this relic </s>
<s> i ve noted that a generic windows 32 bit is about all epson offers </s>
<s> nothing really old about it it s used to print cellphone voucher tickets in wide format using tractor </s>
<s> support say they have never seen this problem </s>
<s> thinking either printer fault or needs new installation of win xp serv 2 installation looks very good and there r no viruses present </s>
<s> hoping 4 something more helpful </s>
<s> that s easy to check on another machine your test machine </s>
<s> if it works there it s something on this machine </s>
<s> if it fails there also we start suspecting the hardware </s>
<s> not clear by the way what your os is quot win xp serv 2 quot means quot windows xp sp2 quot </s>
<s> and why not sp3 </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i get where u going </s>
<s> i was trying to avoid taking his printer from his office but it looks like heading that way thanx anyway </s>
<s> i prefer sp2 to sp3 because i get smoother networking linked with win7 in my internet cafe </s>
