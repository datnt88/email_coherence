<s> is it possible to charge devices such as ipod psp and cell phones without having the pc on but still pluged into the pc </s>
<s> it has to be since computers at my school s computer lab is able to do this </s>
<s> i also read about self powered usb hubs could i plug my devices into it and be able to charge them with out having the computer on or having the hub not being pluged into the computer </s>
<s> usb chargers satisfy your needs </s>
<s> pcs that will offer startup by mouse or kbd might do this but i ve not seen that on usb </s>
<s> the current isn t generally sufficient for charging with the pc turned off </s>
<s> i know that there are usb chargers but im just asking about if it was possible and if self powered usb hub could charge devices alone </s>
<s> you d have to know their specs and test them </s>
<s> what you d be looking for is how much current they offer versus a standard charger </s>
<s> as well a good charger will sense the amount of current being drawn and adjust itself accordingly </s>
<s> usb attachment to a pc or non dedicated charging device may work or work somewhat but this isn t a substitute for a proper charger </s>
<s> if you read the usual usb spec the power should be off until a pc commands the hub to power up </s>
<s> of course there may be a hub that doesn t meet the usb specs </s>
<s> because of this i picked up a wall mount usb charger </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i found a article on cnet that relates to it i beileave something like this would charge independently </s>
<s> why not get that </s>
<s> here s something similar to what i use </s>
<s> google for quot charging station or dock quot should get you in the right direction </s>
<s> the key for your needs is the flexibility of various different connections and or universal one if supplied adapter </s>
<s> of course if your university school uses such why not see what they use </s>
<s> you may find that such a station may offer to charge only similar same devices because so many devices get used and returned to be charged </s>
