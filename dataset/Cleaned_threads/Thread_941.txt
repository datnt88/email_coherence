<s> my mickey mouse phone company citizen s telecom frontier communications wants an arm and a leg to quot rent quot their 356k dsl wireless modem each month </s>
<s> but they say i can buy one from a third party they ll hook it up for 25 </s>
<s> i d like to be able to buy intall one myself but i m not sure which type i ll need which manufacturer is best </s>
<s> gateway 2 wire or whichever company can provide the cheapest that will do the job </s>
<s> i am a senior citizen running mac osx10 4 11 </s>
<s> can anyone advise me </s>
<s> every penny counts </s>
<s> thanx </s>
<s> i loaned my dsl modem to a neighbor for troubleshooting </s>
<s> so while hookup is a breeze sometimes they must do that step if a wiring change is required in some external box </s>
<s> but you should be able to install the thing </s>
<s> but back to setup </s>
<s> i can t count how many know knowthing about pppoe </s>
<s> if you don t you may not be ready to install </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i can set up any acct information preferences etc just need to know what dsl modem would be easiest and most compatible with my provider and my mac os </s>
<s> if not let them do it the first time </s>
<s> also if you didn t research pppoe </s>
<s> it shows you may have issues </s>
<s> call the geeksquad and have them come to your home and take care of it and also get a tune up and it s all covered if you have a problem down the road </s>
<s> sometimes we just have to pay </s>
<s> at my fl home i ve installed a pppoe point to point protocol over ethernet ethernet modem and separate wireless router on an at t line successfully </s>
<s> i want to try it myself on this phone line from mickey mouse telecom but i need to know what type wireless dsl modem works best with my mac os </s>
<s> this phone company charges 19 99 per month for dial up so slow that the connection times out before pages load </s>
<s> its cost for the quot light quot cheapest dsl is 29 99 3 99 for modem rental </s>
<s> i ll only use it for 6 mos of my one year mandated contract so instead of paying 33 98 a month for 12 months i ll effectively be paying 67 96 per month actual usage </s>
<s> mickey mouse telecom has no provision for temporarily suspending service as other companies do </s>
<s> i don t want to pay them 1 cent more than necessary </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> writing just a bit more tells me you shouldn t have any issue </s>
<s> i didn t know that you had setup this before or what country you were in </s>
<s> go for it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanx for everything now linksys has lousy support for mac any clues about which manufacturer has decent support </s>
<s> but you don t need it </s>
<s> for a setup with modem then a router you just have the router do the pppoe login </s>
