<s> i have been struggling for a couple months now to get my computer to burn a dvd r disk </s>
<s> the computer works fine with r but when i try to create a r the disk writes a little information on the disk and then the drive and computer lockup </s>
<s> i have tried just about everything i can think of without lick </s>
<s> drive type i currently have an i o magic drive but even purchased an pioneer </s>
<s> with the i o magic i could write r but not r with the pioneer i could not get either to work </s>
<s> windows i was using windows2000 but just spent the weekend upgrading to windows xp and it has the same result </s>
<s> software i have used many software packages including nero roxio and pinnacle </s>
<s> disk types i have tried both teon and verbatim disks </s>
<s> i have read other forums and found others having similar situations but no smoking gun </s>
<s> ideas welcome </s>
<s> see if there is some updated firmware and my trick of recording at 1 2 or lower the rated drive or media speed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i checked io magic for the latest firmware and loaded an update already without any change in operation </s>
<s> have also tried all the various speeds also without progress </s>
<s> other thoughts </s>
<s> if it isnt the oldest bad doctor joke in history its probably close a guy goes to the doctor moves his arm in a funky way and says doc it hurts when i do this </s>
<s> dont do that the doctor inevitably answers </s>
<s> until you sort it out stop doing that </s>
<s> it s likely the drive needs firmware or is failing but you didn t supply the exact make model of the drive </s>
<s> hint i o magic didn t make that drive </s>
<s> it s something they got in bulk and had their label put on </s>
