<s> can you suggest a decent 48 port unmanaged switch </s>
<s> rupesh narvekar </s>
<s> or required speed </s>
<s> personally i always liked 3com but they got bought by hp </s>
<s> we picked up a 48 port baseline model for our school </s>
<s> its auto sensing 10 100 with a gigabit uplink and has worked fine </s>
<s> we ve a couple of 24 port 3coms and one poe used for the wireless system </s>
<s> none have ever had a problem </s>
<s> these are all their quot baseline quot models which are unmanaged rack mountable and moderately priced </s>
<s> i ll recommend 3com any day if you can still find their products but more about your needs would be helpful </s>
<s> we have 2mbps direct internet line so 2 up and 2 down </s>
<s> i am looking for a unmanaged switch nothing too complicated </s>
<s> has anybody had any issues with 3548xl en </s>
<s> i am planning to use cisco 3745 hsec vpn k9 adsl voip 6fe modular access router security bundle with the swicth </s>
<s> rupesh narvekar </s>
<s> since you are considering cisco for part of your system you might want to stick with the brand </s>
<s> here s a 48 port poe switch they offer </s>
<s> i don t know the price and suspect it might make me drop over </s>
<s> like most cisco gear it will run forever </s>
<s> this device is end of life and end of support so don t pay a lot for it maybe 100 all depends what you want to do with it if you just want to hook a bunch of stuff to your router it will do fine even if you run vlans and such </s>
<s> note this is a managed switch you may have to do some basic config </s>
<s> will review that </s>
<s> i am not married to cisco i am also looking at hp procurve unmanaged switch </s>
<s> i really don t want any managed or smart switches rupesh </s>
<s> and since you mentioned voip it sounds more like a business application for telephone use </s>
<s> digital phones need power and this is why i wondered if poe would be a better choice </s>
<s> i think you ve not given enough details as to exactly what you want to accomplish but if all you want is a 48 port un managed switch you are can pick any name brand that offers such and consider it to be expendable </s>
<s> this is about 1900 wow </s>
<s> you did say you wanted voip and 48 ports but what i see is a business use system </s>
<s> if you re using voip type phones such as i ve seen in some environments they need to be powered by something </s>
<s> i can t imagine 48 wall outlets so suggested the poe switch </s>
<s> these will power phones but not all of the ports will necessarily have that power on by default </s>
<s> you turn power on only to the ports that need to power devices and you have a maximum amount of current to work with </s>
<s> there is some management involved with poe switches but it s not all that technical if it s just power management </s>
<s> but if you ve already got power to all of your phones via some other method you can still use a baseline switch </s>
<s> i just thought this would eliminate a lot of extra wiring by getting it from the switch </s>
<s> it s up to you since we really cannot envision the scope of the entire project </s>
