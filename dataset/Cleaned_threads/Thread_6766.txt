<s> soundblaster live 24 bit eax console device supported not detected i just installed a soundblaster live 24 bit 7 1 sound card and logitech x 530 5 1 speakers in my 2ghz celeron 512 mb ram xp home emachines which came with avance audio apapter on the mboard </s>
<s> i get good sound through the front speakers and subwoofer but nothing through the rear and center speakers </s>
<s> when i try to run the creative mediasource player s eax console through the tools menu in organizer there is no green eax button which i believe is what i need to turn on surround sound for this card i just get an error message the audio device supported by this application is not detected </s>
<s> the application will exit </s>
<s> and it won t run </s>
<s> i also installed the dfx master pack of audio plug ins for winamp win media player and others but when i try to use them i get no sound at all in those programs </s>
<s> when i originally ran the install program for the soundblaster live as it started i got this error setup could not detect any soundblaster live </s>
<s> 24 bit on your system </s>
<s> please ensure that you soundblaster hardware is properly installed before running this setup program </s>
<s> setup will now exit </s>
<s> but then the install runs as if normal and ends with congratulations </s>
<s> your sound card was successfully installed then i reboot as asked </s>
<s> i ve done this 3 times ending up with the same problem i described above </s>
<s> i ve checked the card position and the speaker wires several times and they all are correct </s>
<s> the sb live is thedefault sound card on the system </s>
<s> can you please help </s>

<s> the motherboard drivers needed to be installed first </s>
<s> it s a mess </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what do you mean by the motherboard drivers needed to be installed first </s>
<s> which ones and where are they and how here s another aspect of my case </s>
<s> after posting i took the sb card back to best buy and exchanged it for another same card thinking it could be bad </s>
<s> i swapped pci slots with a modem and rebooted </s>
<s> after xp started i saw detection of quot new quot modem and quot new quot sb live 24 bit sound card going on in the system tray </s>
<s> then an error box came up quot the installshield engine ikernel exe could not be installed </s>
<s> the system cannot find the file specified quot </s>
<s> then xp abruptly turned off the computer and restarted </s>
<s> this happened 4 times </s>
<s> then i took out all the cards and it rebooted ok in control panel the default audio device is now the original avance ac97 audio and the sb live isn t even listed </s>
<s> i never uninstalled anything that came with the card </s>
<s> i installed a new maxtor 80gb drive to replace my old 40gb that came with the machine </s>
<s> i used the maxblast software to copy the entire old drive to make the new one the c boot drive </s>
<s> it boots and everything is as it was except a few programs thought they weren t registered or their trial period was over </s>
<s> the quot unregistered quot ones worked ok after i entered the reg </s>
<s> no s </s>
<s> this has me wondering if the maxblast program overlooked or corrupted a few files probably hidden ones </s>
<s> or a certain folder where all these reside </s>
<s> i left my old drive intact with all the files on it in the machine as e i relabelled the c drive before the sound card installation </s>
<s> it was fornerly quot local disk quot </s>
<s> could that be a problem for programs looking for certain files </s>
<s> i just did a search for ikernel exe it is in the same path on both drives quot program files common files installshield engine 6 intel 32 quot </s>
<s> i am holding off doing anything else until i get answers to some questions like a should i uninstall all the creative software </s>
<s> what special thing should i do with the device drivers etc </s>
<s> b the install instructions said to hit cancel if xp asked for the device drivers </s>
<s> should i run their install again anyway </s>
<s> c could the quot missing quot ikernel be why the eax app is malfunctioning </s>
<s> d i did a system restore save point just before switching hard drives </s>
<s> should i restore it first </s>
<s> e should i get a different card </s>
<s> would that really help </s>
<s> after all i just wanted to listen to some music </s>
<s> droidbot7000 </s>
<s> if you get a creative card go straight to creative com and get the upgraded software </s>
<s> the stuff they sent with the card was junk and cost me a day trying this and that </s>
