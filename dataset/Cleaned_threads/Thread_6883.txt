<s> which is better </s>
<s> what s the difference </s>
<s> my pc config is a amd sempron 2400 socket a 256 mb ddr pc 400 inno 3d geforce 4 mx 440 agp 8x kinda sucks cause the gf 4 cant play splinter cell because it dosent have a shader im planning to upgrade my ddr and graphic card so please help me to choose between 6600 6600le thanks </s>
<s> show the le is the bottom of the 6600 tree </s>
<s> full review 6600 s in le normal gt are shown </s>
<s> geebee </s>
<s> well i guess about that review you ve shown me the big difference is the price between 6600le and 6600gt although le cuts the power lesser than the gt i guess i wont notice that very much thanks for the reply </s>
<s> when your target is one of the most power hungry games and you re considering cutting corners on graphics cards </s>
<s> as an indicator of just how badly anything lower than a 6600gt will do in splinter cell and keeping with that same site have a look notice the 1024 x 768 shader model 3 scores </s>
<s> using the frame rates as an indicator splinter cell prefers cards with more ram go back to the other review and look for a game there which shows similar 6600gt scores </s>
<s> gun metal game 2 1600 x 1200 shows a slightly higher frame rate score for the 6600gt 20 more than splinter cell and look where the le comes in don t forget to substract 20 </s>
<s> gb </s>
<s> 6600le wont do it huh </s>
<s> maybe i could spend some more on a 6800gt or less and more ram maybe a 2 gig will do i ve upgraded my pc to a athlon x2 and a 2 gig ddr2 i have a inno 3d 6200 pcie i think i could buy a 6800gt or a 7200 i think this would do the trick </s>
<s> though i may be too late try saving up for a 7600gt </s>
<s> it could play all the latest games at nearly break neck speed </s>
<s> though if you could go for say a 7900gt or an x1800gto or x1900gt then go for it </s>
