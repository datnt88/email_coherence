<s> i know a shredder isn t a true peripheral but it should be in every office so </s>
<s> i had a gbc shredder that worked okay for a year or so before dying and these royals i see on ebay are not well reviewed </s>
<s> i want something that will handle all those credit card offers without having to open them </s>
<s> and erase cd s too </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> i happen to visit officemax and office depot today and gezzz i didn t know they had so many quot shedders quot now </s>
<s> these aren t the little basic shedders neither that you can place atop a trash can but come far better in motor and cutter ability </s>
<s> they offer to cut those plastic and cds as well provided you pay enough for such a model </s>
<s> i just looked them over i wasn t interested but thought to mention it </s>
<s> the local stores here has at least 7 8 different models to review </s>
<s> check them out first hand rather than a catalog or such </s>
<s> but i m sure those with large amp motors specs tend to work better imho </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> whatever you get make sure its a crosscut shredder </s>
<s> the ones that just cut into narrow strips are insecure </s>
<s> fry s a month or so ago had one on special a quot tech ko quot for 15 and i got it </s>
<s> works fine and while i have never tried a cd it does fine on a credit card </s>
<s> i am not sure it can take a whole cc offer unopened though as its rated 5 sheets at a time and the envelope plus 1 folded page whould be 5 thicknesses </s>
<s> i don t bother shredding the whole cc offer just the one page you return to get the card which is usually the one page with my name address on it </s>
<s> the rest goes in my paper recycle box </s>
<s> rich </s>
