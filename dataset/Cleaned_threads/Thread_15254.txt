<s> i m attempting to set up an hp2420 32 bit printer on my network with a cat5e cable </s>
<s> i have all winxp pro pcs </s>
<s> i previously always attached this printer to a pc but i want this one on the lan now </s>
<s> i googled the steps but still can t see the printer </s>
<s> here s what i did print an hp2420 configuration page with jet direct page ip address 10 34 204 4 add printer wizard choose quot local install quot option and create a port </s>
<s> use the dropdown list for a tcp ip port then use that ip address 10 34 204 4 got to the manufacturer s list page choose quot have disk quot and browse to my driver </s>
<s> highlight one of the files there and click ok and follow through with the rest of the steps that ip address doesn t look like my normal ips </s>
<s> i had planned to use 192 168 2 113 before i read the google blog but using 192 168 2 113 fails also </s>
<s> and as always someone wants to use it yesterday </s>
<s> i m self taught on systems since this is only part of my job but i m a good monkey if it s explained </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> while the network expert could add a route to that address i will not tell how here as the network maintainer must be able to do that </s>
<s> why not put the printer address on your lan </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> apparently i m missing a step </s>
<s> yeah i thought about putting the printer on the server but i ll leave that to my server vender since i don t want to mess up their work on the server </s>
<s> that s why i m trying this way myself </s>
<s> if it doesn t work i ll have them come in but their earliest date is 10 days out </s>
<s> sorry but why not change the ip to one that is on your lan </s>
<s> it should be at most a 5 minute job to change this or you could research how ip works </s>
<s> i can t give a course in that here </s>
<s> but i will share it won t work as laid out above </s>
<s> and i ll share the 5 minute fix </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you may wonder why i can t tell you what ip address to set the printer to so i thought i d recap this </s>
<s> 1 i don t know what your lan settings are </s>
<s> that is without the 192 168 1 x for the range and the netmask of 255 255 255 0 being revealed by you as well as your current dhcp range this means no one can tell you what to do in this regard </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> 10 x x x is not on a 192 x x x lan </s>
<s> period </s>
<s> i offered that one might add a route but declined to write how since the maintainer must be able to do that </s>
<s> doing such by my advice would only bad advice as the maintainer would not be able to fix it again </s>
<s> 3 here the hp usually can be set to dhcp and the hp driver software will locate the printer automatically </s>
<s> however you will find die hard to new networkers that want to assign all addresses </s>
<s> they usually flame out or the newness wears off </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob thanks for the tips </s>
<s> my server guy stopped in yesterday </s>
<s> i was attempting to do what you suggested by changing the ip in the printer but i was missing the menu item to do that my wife says i m blind </s>
<s> once we did that we put the driver on the server and voila </s>
<s> we have contact </s>
<s> i got the printer from ebay and the prior owner apparently had that setting in there </s>
<s> as usual i learned something from my mistake which is a good thing </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> me too </s>
<s> long ago my pager wasn t working </s>
<s> during lunch i went to the support line where the nice fellow took my pager opened it and flipped the battery over </s>
<s> i guess i should have been watching the show as he did that with about every third person </s>
<s> quot next quot yes i hung my head after i said my thank you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob if you re still following this i put my original question on another board at the same time as cnet </s>
<s> a responder there wanted me to tell him my gateway ip i assume he meant my default gateway which i declined </s>
<s> if i had sent that is that enough info for someone to hack my lan assuming i wasn t behind my hardware software firewalls </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> the lan information is non routable so without any stress i can share my lan s ip address range netmask and gateway </s>
<s> this one didn t need that and while your experts can add a route i hope you understand i can t in good conscious do that for folk </s>
<s> if i did and they didn t understand how it works then later they would not be able to fix it </s>
<s> so as you can see the printer needed to be on the lan which you did and it s much easier to fix and maintain now </s>
<s> bob </s>
