<s> i ve recently brought an old ish computer from a friend so you can imagine not all the install cds manuals are there </s>
<s> the sound system is an altec lansing ada885 </s>
<s> the left right and surround speakers are working fine however no sound is coming from the subwoofer </s>
<s> the subwoofer is on and it does pass it s own diagnostic check press a button gt makes a sound </s>
<s> all the connections are fine </s>
<s> however it never makes a sound in any windows application or game </s>
<s> could it be a soundcard issue </s>
<s> i m using creative sound blaster </s>
<s> value card </s>
<s> it s updated to their newest version </s>
<s> in the sb control program there is an option to select 2 or 4 speaker but none for subwoofer </s>
<s> is it supposed to be that way </s>
<s> thanks for any help i m very new to this </s>
<s> windows 2000 dell demension xps b800r 600 p3 128 rdram </s>
<s> go to control panel sound and under sound playback you pick the speaker layout </s>
<s> the card you have does support the subwoofer </s>
<s> stereo headphones desktop stereo speakers laptop mono speakers laptop stereo speakers monitor stero speakers monitor stand stereo speakers monitor mounted stereo speakers keyboard stereo speakers quadraphonic speakers surround sound speakers 5 1 surround sound speakers these are the options that i have under control panel gt sounds and multimedia gt audio gt sound playback gt sb live </s>
<s> audio df40 gt advanced gt speakers </s>
<s> i ve tried just about every one of those without any success </s>
<s> the surround sound speaker setting should at least get the woofer working </s>
<s> maybe the speaker is defective or is plugged in incorrectly </s>
<s> you should be getting sounds from it </s>
