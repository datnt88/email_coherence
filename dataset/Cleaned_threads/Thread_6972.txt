<s> just wondering because the sound blaster x fi only has 3 line outs </s>
<s> i m guessing more than one speaker channel is encoded on a line and it is separated within the speaker system or receiver </s>
<s> well i m pretty sure a speaker set for pcs could do it not sure about a receiver </s>
<s> 3 jacks </s>
<s> if it s jacks then these jacks are probably in stereo is my guess </s>
<s> of course </s>
<s> can t believe that didn t occur to me </s>
<s> one channel with have front l r another will have rear l r and the third will have center </s>
<s> the speaker system i guess will then decide what goes to the sub and what finally goes to the speakers </s>
