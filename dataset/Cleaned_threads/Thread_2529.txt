<s> i have internet with a company called surewest </s>
<s> the dsl modem they gave me is a knock off kind of third party modem a comtrend adsl2 ethernet router or so it says </s>
<s> however i happen to have obtained a nice 2wire dsl modem that has all kinds of wireless networking capabilities built right into it </s>
<s> now since my service seems to lock out every single type of modem but its own specific one is there any way to route my crappy modem into the nice 2wire one and have all of the nice networking capabilities it has built into it </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> dsl is two wire </s>
<s> modem router output is 4 wire </s>
<s> on what modems work with their system </s>
<s> it s possible that the 2wire modem will work but only your isp can tell you that </s>
