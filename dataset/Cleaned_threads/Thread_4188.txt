<s> unless i restart the computer </s>
<s> i m not sure if that s just vista or if it was because it was refurbished </s>
<s> i guess that s why they say reliable </s>
<s> i can t afford to restart every hour </s>
<s> should i go with vista or back to xp </s>
<s> i ve heard that vista guzzles up your hard drive </s>
<s> so if i went with vista how much hard drive space would i actually need </s>
<s> i ll still consider refurbished if anyone knows any good companies </s>
<s> how are these sites </s>
<s> and what does open box mean </s>

<s> quot few problems with not being able to open any programs right click etc </s>
<s> unless i restart the computer quot these issues are not uncommon with windows </s>
<s> today s pests invade and damage the os causing such troubles </s>
<s> it won t matter what machine you have so its best to learn how to deal with such damage or learn how to reinstall the os back to some working condition </s>
<s> again a new machine of any windows os could have this situation repeat with regularity unless you figure out what protection was left out or what action such as p2p use was letting the pest do it s dirty </s>

<s> the suggestions of the company make me think they ve not thought seriously about computers at least not for a long time </s>
<s> win 2000 is gonna be hard to work with nowadays </s>
<s> pentium ii or iii or 4 are too slow for modern work </s>
<s> what does the job entail </s>
<s> i really think quot computer illiterate quot goes best with talking to live people at a store you like </s>
<s> try a best buy their employees aren t on commission </s>
<s> buying mail order is ok to save but only if you know what you re doing can handle the configuration set up yourself and don t want good service </s>
<s> for someone who really needs their machine for work and doesn t know a lot about them could really benefit from a place that can do set ups and service plans </s>
<s> when your paycheck depends on it it s different than if it s just for messing around on myspace or cnet </s>
