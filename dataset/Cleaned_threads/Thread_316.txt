<s> i was wondering how do you wire an rj45 wall socket after it has been daisy chained </s>
<s> my friend said that the wires need to be connected for the sockets to work </s>
<s> for example cable a is connected in its respected slot and cable b is connected in its respected slot </s>
<s> how would i connect cable a to cable b </s>
<s> in fact how would i connect the cables together if there were 4 or 5 cables that need to be connected </s>
<s> i have a guess that i would need to create some sort of jumper wire between the sockets but i don t want to jump the gun on this one and have to redo all the work </s>
<s> if more details are required just ask </s>
<s> i am still new to most of this but working on learning as much as i can </s>
<s> with a network connection </s>
<s> each connector has to be connected to a hub or router </s>
<s> you cannot quot piggy back quot a digital connection </s>
<s> voice ok not digital </s>
<s> have you noticed that there is no provision on the connector to add another wire </s>
<s> there s a reason for that </s>
<s> quot you cannot quot piggy back quot a digital connection </s>
<s> voice ok not digital quot by your statement above it seems to me that you are saying you can connect telephone together </s>
<s> how would one do that </s>
<s> digital no </s>
<s> telephones can be daisy chained or home run your choice as they are all hooked in parallel </s>
<s> digital cannot </s>
