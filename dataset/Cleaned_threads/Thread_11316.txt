<s> i live in a large two story house with an upstairs office at one end of the house and a downstairs office at the opposite end </s>
<s> the cable enters the house on the second floor and i have used a di d link connected to the cable modem to transmit a signal to the downstairs office for a second computer </s>
<s> when i started frequent dropped signals downstairs i installed a netgear in the wall plugs near the cable modem connecting to the downstairs </s>
<s> that seemed to help but i later added a much longer aerial extender to the d link wireless router </s>
<s> i have decided to get an up to date wireless router to see if i can stop the dropped connections </s>
<s> i need advice on which one to buy for consistency of connection over a large area of the house </s>

<s> it is unlikely you will see much difference </s>
<s> most routers transmit at the maximum legal power </s>
<s> you have already tried the larger antenna trick which is pretty much the only option to manipulate the signal </s>
<s> you quot may quot see better performance if you move all your equipment to n rather than g but its more because n is more tolerant of interference that g the transmit power is exactly the same </s>
<s> if you already run n then the brand of router will not make a difference </s>
<s> if you have not tried it you can move one of your antenna parallel to the ceiling floor </s>
<s> router antenna are generally designed to transmit the signal horizontally and not up and down </s>
<s> maybe you get lucky but floors ceiling eat a lot more signal than walls do </s>
<s> if i read that you have used the ethernet over powerline and place a second wireless ap on the end that is one of the more common solutions to this problem </s>
<s> wireless drops are a fact of life and you just have to live with them if you want to use wireless </s>
<s> it all comes down to interference that you can do little about </s>
<s> thanks bill012 i have not tried the pointing of the long antenna yet </s>
<s> another comment was to make sure that i did not have a quot flakey quot internet card in the receiving computer downstairs </s>
<s> i will let you know what i finally do and if it makes any difference at all </s>
