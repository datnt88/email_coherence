<s> what is the main difference in performance between ata hdds and sata hdds </s>
<s> do you notice the difference </s>
<s> i know there is some difference in speed but i wonder if the common user has any need for the sata drives </s>
<s> the difference in price isn t a lot but if the difference in speed isn t to be noticed i don t find a reason to get a sata drive as of now </s>
<s> tnak you all in advance </s>
<s> there is no performance gain with sata in the real world </s>
<s> it is easier to set up </s>
<s> quot what is the main difference in performance between ata hdds and sata hdds quot intel was lamenting on the cost of the cables and wanted something with less connections less pcb space and to lower costs </s>
<s> they knew it would not go well unless the speed could go up as well </s>
<s> since the differences are documented all over the web i offer the prior sentences to throw a little light that sata wasn t about speeding up the drive </s>
<s> quot do you notice the difference </s>
<s> i know there is some difference in speed but i wonder if the common user has any need for the sata drives </s>
<s> the difference in price isn t a lot but if the difference in speed isn t to be noticed i don t find a reason to get a sata drive as of now quot you should find benchmarks on the usual places </s>
<s> and such </s>
<s> for today for the machines i ve seen little difference </s>
<s> the machine produced seti packets at the same rate booted in about the same time and the web pages appeared at the same speed </s>
<s> i wouldn t see this as a make or break item on a new machine but will continue to write that over investing in 32 bit machines is to be avoided </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> here it is in a nutshell ata isn t going to be around after maybe 2 3 yrs well until the stocks dry up </s>
<s> sata is here to stay and most newer systems support it and will become the defacto std </s>
<s> to have </s>
<s> as for speed a more notable difference can be had once everything falls into place when </s>
<s> well that s coming but yes the speed difference is there already just isn t so obivious </s>
<s> 1 2 yrs </s>
<s> is a long time in the computer world so unless you need ata get sata and as you ve noticed pricing isn t a great wall to overcome if you re planning to buy now many a mtrbd </s>
<s> has either connecters or an adapter can be had so even that isn t a stopper </s>
<s> in real terms provided no great hang up when the last great push of ata is done roughly 5yrs pasts before you wonder what ever happened to them and they re history </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> i have a couple of wd raptor drives and can say that these quot seem quot to be quicker than even my ibm deskstars some call them quot deathstars quot which were said to be the ide champions before the wd upped theirs to 8 megs of cache </s>
<s> i notice the difference however only when performing specific tasks which clock time such as backup events </s>
<s> what i think we need to remember is that ide ata drives underwent a metamorphasis over it s life and got faster and faster as the technology improved with competition for sales </s>
<s> sata should do the same but is in it s infancy now </s>
<s> as your ata drives die out the satas do offer some small benefits now so i would not avoid them if your mb supports them natively </s>
<s> i would not go out and by a pci add in card just to accommodate the new drives because these will probably never be impressive and are not inexpensive </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i mena you push quite a bit for not overinvesting in stuff that is 32bit due to the increasing 64bit </s>
<s> will the hdd s be different with 64bit </s>
<s> which is about right when you think that the read write recording head is not reading off multiple tracks bob </s>
