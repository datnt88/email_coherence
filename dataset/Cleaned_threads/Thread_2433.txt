<s> i am considering purchasng a jump drive to back up my computer </s>
<s> is this feasible </s>
<s> how would i know how many mbs or gbs i would need </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if you have 40gb of disk data to back up to achieve a reliable backup you need 3 copies </s>
<s> 1 for storage away from the machine number 2 as the copy that you will not overwrite during backup and number 3 will be the set you use to backup to </s>
<s> since 1gb jumpdrives are fairly common you need 120 of these units and with that many lets say you get them at the discount sale price of 59 bucks each </s>
<s> 7 080 later and heavy in debt you wonder if this was a good idea </s>
<s> dvdrw backup seems cheaper </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> maybe you should consider a externial usb harddrive for the task </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> 1 has a write protect switch </s>
<s> 2 you have 3 of them </s>
<s> 3 you keep one out of the building that has the pc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes only if people would do backups </s>
<s> i know of a lot of compainies that don t have good backups </s>
<s> and thats scary </s>
