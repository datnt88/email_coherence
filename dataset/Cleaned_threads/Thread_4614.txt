<s> will a prescott series p4 operate properly in any 800mhz mainboard or does it require special chipset support </s>
<s> i tend to think that because the main difference between the prescott and other 800mhz p4s is the l2 cache and that it is an on die cache it should not require any special mainboard but i could be wrong </s>
<s> also what types of uses is the 1meg l2 cache going to benefit the most </s>
<s> the answer is not so simple </s>
<s> the bios must support it as well </s>
<s> some boards didn t boot until the bios was updated </s>
<s> since you didn t share the make model of the motherboard you didn t give the forums a chance to find out if said p4 was supported </s>
<s> so far we read just p4 w 800mhz fsb and quot prescott quot </s>
<s> there is a lot of parallels between the auto parts stories and this one </s>
<s> there s a long story about buying a replacement lamp for the headlights </s>
<s> it s amazing the details that are needed to know what fits what </s>
<s> same story here </s>
<s> tell more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that actually is the short answer as the rest of the research i can do myself now that i know there s no quot simple quot answer </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> still wondering where what types of apps the benefit from the larger l2 would be </s>
<s> i know seti runs get shorter and the ht is supported in most linux and xp to give almost everything a boost </s>
<s> look to and you may find some cpu benchmarks of interest </s>
<s> beware that the 64 bit wave is getting closer </s>
<s> don t overinvest bob </s>
<s> fred motto just enough is never enough </s>
<s> enough is too much </s>
<s> too much is just right </s>
<s> so we re talking about socket 478 motherboards equipped with a chipset supporting 800mhz system bus and prescott psc cpus </s>
<s> yep there s a small public documented info amount </s>
<s> at present the landscape is that prescott requires at least fmb 1 5 fmb means flexible motherboard guidelines </s>
<s> so the main correlation is between cpu and motherboard s fmb </s>
<s> for example installing a psc fmb 1 5 cpu into a fmb 1 0 motherboard could not work at all or work unsatisfactorily </s>
<s> i d show two examples full prescott compatibility section of this page </s>
<s> intel s genuine motherboards </s>
<s> one can see from this page the minimum aa for psc support </s>
<s> cetin trying to unweave unwind unravel and piece together the past and the future t s eliot </s>
