<s> hi everyone </s>
<s> i wonder if i can get some expert advice here keep in mind this is somewhat greek to me </s>
<s> i currently have a belkin 4 port wireless g router hooked up to 4 computers wired and a 5th laptop wirelessly </s>
<s> i just got a rosewill rnx easy n4 wireless n router which i am going to replace the belkin with </s>
<s> nothing wrong with the belkin except that it constantly loses the wireless signal and i have to keep unplugging it really a pain </s>
<s> the current setup has a printer locally attached to each computer and printer sharing across the network </s>
<s> the problem with this of course is that to use a particular printer the computer it is attached to has to be on </s>
<s> i ve got a dell 3100n color laser now and i want to get rid of all these other printers well almost all of them there are 2 i will keep </s>
<s> the 3100n is network capable but not wireless capable </s>
<s> so i was wondering 1 what s the quot ideal quot way to do this and 2 can it be done somehow utilizing the belkin so i don t have to buy anymore equipment </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> keep wired what you can keep wired and please set up per this forum s top post or sticky </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob </s>
<s> i have setup the belkin router as well as updated the firmware it s been running like this for a year every day i have to unplug it at least once to get my wireless signal back </s>
<s> so i won t use it anymore for the wireless networking i ll replace it with the rosewill </s>
<s> but i need to hardwire 4 of the 5 computers and i want to put 3 printers on the network in such a way that i don t have to connect them directly to a computer and have that computer quot on quot so that i can print from any other computer </s>
<s> i just thought that i might be able to do something with the belkin router to accomplish this instead of buying a print server </s>
<s> every print server i ve seen handles 1 printer so i need one for each printer </s>
<s> then i need an ethernet switch because all my ports on the wireless router are already used up by computers </s>
<s> do you see how lost i am </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> that the issue of daily boots has been cured too many times by using our forum sticky </s>
<s> about your want to network printers without a pc as the server </s>
<s> gt go get a printer server </s>
<s> even a wifi one is fine </s>
<s> as to ports post 17 can save you bucks as you don t need to buy a switch </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> if you ask me what post 17 is that means you have not read the forum sticky </s>
<s> that the usb ports are being turned off in the device manager to save power </s>
<s> try this and see if it helps the problem </s>
<s> go to device manager right click my computer left click properties left click hardware left click device manager go to the usb controller section and click the sign </s>
<s> go to each usb root hub and right click on it left click properties left click power management </s>
<s> uncheck the box allow computer to turn off this device to save power </s>
<s> restart your computer </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> thank you bob </s>
<s> yes i have read all the stickys especially post 2 by pudgy </s>
<s> i have set up the router established wpa 2 psk i have updated the firmware i have been on the phone with belkin tech support etc etc the wired computers have no problems with the internet connection it s the wireless laptop signal i have the problem with </s>
<s> it will i don t know fade or disappear or i don t know how to explain it i had to configure 3 different connections in the vista laptop settings so when the signal goofs up i can connect using a second or third one does that make sense </s>
<s> probably not </s>
<s> sometimes i get a good strong connection with my workgroup name showing </s>
<s> other times i can only get local internet access but no workgroup </s>
<s> it says quot identifying mynetwork quot forever and will not give me a network map as it doesn t recognize the network as private even though it is </s>
<s> it s terribly difficult for me to explain because i m not sure how to explain this properly </s>
<s> i had a linksys wireless b router before this and never experienced this problem matter of fact i ve never seen this problem on any wireless network i ve configured for anyone </s>
<s> but back to the question at hand you think it would be best if i go ahead and get a print server </s>
<s> okay any suggestions </s>
<s> every one i saw on the web is a single connection for one printer </s>
<s> does that mean i need 3 of them </s>
<s> i had a read of sticky 17 good info and i will utilize it </s>
<s> thank you rick for your suggestion </s>
<s> but the wired computers do not exhibit a connection problem only the wireless laptop </s>
<s> i wonder if removing the power control for the wireless adapter might resolve the issue i ll have to try that </s>
<s> the wireless card also has one of those settings </s>
<s> go to device manager right click my computer left click properties left click hardware left click device manager </s>
<s> click on network and then right click on your wireless adapter left click properties power management </s>
<s> uncheck the box allow computer to turn off this device to save power </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> there s a reason </s>
<s> it s because some routers don t like that </s>
<s> issues such as routers that run slowly or lockup are common </s>
<s> i had hoped that you would reveal your settings </s>
<s> then i could comment directly about them </s>
<s> in one sentence try all defaults broadcast ssid wpa and latest firmware </s>
<s> gt about the printer server </s>
<s> i picked up a 26 dollar printer server with 2 ports </s>
<s> it s this one </s>
<s> but i have yet to run 2 printers and will not vouch for it </s>
<s> but i do own 2 of them as i am running a nas on one </s>
<s> here s the link to it and if they are out of stock look at other sites </s>
<s> there must be similar units for similar prices </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you know thinking back i had this router with the current configuration using a winxp laptop with a netgear card </s>
<s> i never ever had a problem with the connection </s>
<s> it only happened when i upgraded to a new laptop with vista home premium with an internal realtek g network adapter </s>
<s> hmmm well thank you very much for the print server suggestion </s>
<s> i see it is oos so i ll have a look around and see if i can find it any place else </s>
<s> but for the dell 3100n laser which is network capable can i just plug it into a router port using sticky 17 setup with an ethernet cable and assign it an ip address somehow </s>
<s> then i would only need 1 print server i think </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> we cover that later but that entry needs a rewrite </s>
<s> let me share directly what we want to disable in vista </s>
<s> ready </s>
<s> google this gt dhcp broadcast flag hint </s>
<s> strong one disable that </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> oh bob i was just reading something about that last night and wondering if that would be something i should try </s>
<s> you rock </s>
<s> d </s>
<s> in the registry editor i see 4 different guid s </s>
<s> i e </s>
<s> in locating hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset services tcpip parameters interfaces guid i find 4 different guid lines should i make the change to all 4 </s>
<s> hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset services tcpip parameters interfaces 0642efcb 8e53 40c6 82bb 3788a1190acd hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset services tcpip parameters interfaces 119f5d9f 849e 4f97 a960 89ff63afd6ee hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset services tcpip parameters interfaces 1419d93c 0050 46a7 ab08 331abaecf716 hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset services tcpip parameters interfaces 3a539854 6a70 11db 887c 806e6f6e6963 i m guessing that 3 of them are probably the connections i set up trying to get this machine to connect to my network and the 4th is probably my neighbor s whom i assist with various computer issues on a regular basis and therefore connect to his network on occasion </s>
<s> so i should modify all 4 of them correct </s>
<s> wow would it be nice to have a proper connection </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> quot wipe them all out quot and thanks for doing research on your own </s>
<s> some members expect nothing but full answers for each new discussion </s>
<s> we need to leverage our forum sticky because it would be far too tiring to copy paste the usuals </s>
<s> if you fall back to the suggested settings wpa for now and kick vista in the teeth once i can t imagine how ms didn t know what they were turning on would not have any bad effects in the real world then you may discover you have a nice stable wifi network </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob i always research things people come to me for help with their systems networks i repair refurb computers on the slide i almost always find what i need by researching and when i get stuck i ask </s>
<s> i had even posted in the vistaheads forum no one had a clue what my problem was </s>
<s> i should have come here a year ago </s>
<s> wow a stable wifi network i don t know what to do with myself now </s>
<s> lol i ll tell you i have yet to be satisfied with vista and all the annoying things microsoft have done with it </s>
<s> the only reason i have it on this laptop is so i could get intimately acquainted with it enough to be able to assist others </s>
<s> when windows 7 comes out if anyone needs help with it they will probably have to start paying at the local computer shop because i don t think i can put myself through any more torture </s>
<s> kudos for bob </s>
<s> man you rock </s>
<s> i have stable wifi for the first time in a year </s>
<s> i owe you one </s>
<s> that forum sticky and what s there is hard won knowledge </s>
<s> thanks to a kind member for helping craft the posts there and a few others that i found useful </s>
<s> that content is hard to argue with but i find some that want to enable wpa2 plus mac filters plus hiding ssid and what else then complain </s>
<s> these basic settings seem to pay off all over </s>
<s> glad it helped you out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> in my house i have comcast internet with linksys modem linksys wrt54g router with 4 pcs 1 hardwired 3 wireless </s>
<s> also hardwired to the router is a linksys wap54g set as access pt </s>
<s> i have a garage with a linksys wre54 repeater and 2 pc s wireless </s>
<s> in the garage the pcs one or the other sometimes both will associate with ap but not the internet if i reboot modem router ap then they will connect pia to have to do that most of the time what do i need to do to make the remote pcs more stable </s>
<s> i have gone over settings and all seems to be set up right all pc s are running xp tia ted o </s>
<s> you see where we used the forum suggested settings </s>
<s> i think you dismissed this early on </s>
<s> do you want to try them </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes i want to see the settings sorry i did not dismiss i m just not sure where to look </s>
<s> i read all the post in the second sticky thanks ted o </s>
<s> let s use a new post or if you have an ongoing post tell what settings you are using </s>
<s> i never duplicate the forum sticky content </s>
<s> it s a small rule to make sure people don t just write quot yes i did that quot see you in your own discussion </s>
