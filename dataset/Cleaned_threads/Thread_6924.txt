<s> looking for a quot possible quot cpu upgrade </s>
<s> i m running a epox ep 9nda3j with a athlon xp 4000 64bit along with 2 gigs of ocs ram and a xf 7800 gs </s>
<s> i m heavily into gaming </s>
<s> so now if i purchase a athlon xp 64 x2 3800 would i benefit at all or would i loose power </s>
<s> if not the 3800 what about the 4200 4400 or 4800 which is rare and prices are through the roof for socket 939 boards </s>
<s> any advice would help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> the games mostly run on single cores so that extra core will assume duties for the os </s>
<s> the results i see is better gameplay </s>
<s> but since you are not increasing the core s speed the payoff here is minimal </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> your athlon 64 4000 runs at 2 4ghz </s>
<s> you d need to get an x2 4600 to match your single threaded performance </s>
<s> the only socket 939 x2s readily available are x2 3800 and x2 4200 which would both be slower in most games than your current cpu </s>
<s> so i d have to either get the dual proc 4600 or 4800 to match the current sing proc 4000 and getting the dual 4200 would t be enough to see a difference </s>
<s> so i m pretty much stuck with my current cpu </s>
<s> i was trying to hold out on the major upgrade </s>
<s> i d love a x2 4800 but prices are outrageous </s>
<s> 350 plus </s>
<s> for instance the time rendering a dvd is nearly cut in half when i use such am upgraded machine </s>
<s> you should get some boost since you ll have at least one core s full attention to the game and the other would be handling the os chores </s>
<s> that s my experience so far </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> they offer a number of dual core processors that you could look at the 165 170 175 180 and 185 see links below don t think you ll be disappointed readily available at newegg the 185 is 235 </s>
