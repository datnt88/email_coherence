<s> i recently acquired a 250 gb western digital hard drive that had been formatted on a mac </s>
<s> on both vista and xp machines it is seen in device manager and disk management but not recognized in explorer so i can t access it to reformat it or use it </s>
<s> in disk management it does not have a drive letter assigned to it and when right clicking on its icon all options except help are grayed out </s>
<s> other than putting it back on a mac as that is not a convenient option is there anyway that i can get windows to assign it a drive letter so that i can reformat and use it </s>
<s> thanks james </s>
<s> i booted up gparted and dispatched the issue in less than 5 minutes </s>
<s> sorry but maybe there is a windows way but i have my solution so i stopped looking </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the input </s>
<s> i neglected to mention that the hd was in a sata usb enclosure </s>
<s> i took a look at the software you suggested but i couldn t find where it supported usb devices </s>
<s> however your suggestion that i try a partition software reminded me that years ago i had added an additional western digital hd to my system and that it had come with a cd containing some set up tools </s>
<s> the program is called data lifeguard tools and one of the options allows me to partition format a hd on a usb port </s>
<s> it worked smooth as silk </s>
<s> i am currently moving some files to it </s>
<s> i will eventually add it to my wireless network using a belkin wireless usb hub </s>
<s> this will allow all of the computers on the network to access it and use it as a file storage transfer device </s>
<s> again thanks for the input </s>
<s> james </s>
<s> yes i ve used gparted on both usb to ide and usb to sata drives </s>
<s> data life guard tools is fine too </s>
