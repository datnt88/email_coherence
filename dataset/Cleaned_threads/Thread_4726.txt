<s> i m getting ready to buy a new video card </s>
<s> in the specs it states the resolutions and the refresh rates i e </s>
<s> 800x600 70hz 1028x720 75hz etc </s>
<s> for the card </s>
<s> while looking at my monitors manual i also noticed that it included these same numbers resolutions refresh rates and that the refresh rates for the same settings were different </s>
<s> my question is which of the two video card or monitor determines the refresh rate you see on the screen </s>
<s> or how does this work </s>
<s> it s very simple </s>
<s> whichever is slower and smallest is what you get to use of the two devices </s>
<s> example </s>
<s> at 800x600 your card says it will do 100 hz refresh </s>
<s> your monitor says 75 hz </s>
<s> you ll use 75 or less hz </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> does the operating system have any effect on this </s>
<s> because i was using win98 and the refresh rate was 56 hz </s>
<s> i swapped out the hard drive to one with xp on it and the refresh rate jumped up to 75 hz </s>
<s> is this normal </s>
<s> os </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> it s all about the drivers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my video card is set to 800x600 and my monitor shows that the refresh rate is 35 khz 56 hz </s>
<s> is there any way that i can get a higher refresh rate </s>
<s> isn t this better for the eyes less strain </s>
<s> just a thought </s>
<s> if i r c a blank area of the desktop and select properties it brings me to a screen that applies to my vid card </s>
<s> if i go through the tabs on that screen i get to a screen that allows me to select refresh rate </s>
<s> in my case it is set to default which gives me a rate slightly higher than yours </s>
<s> i have tested higher rates and for my use i do not see a diff perhaps gamers play with this stuff </s>
