<s> when trying to connect from my laptop to the network we set up on our d link router i get an error message that says quot windows was unable to find a certificate to log you on to the network ssid quot my desktop that connects wirelessly and my roommates laptop do not experience this issue </s>
<s> i ve searched the web and found various solutions like unchecking the certificate in the ssid s properties and such </s>
<s> the problem is though that in my list of wireless clients the network does not show up as a wpa psk connection when it is </s>
<s> it shows the network and says wpa on my desktop but this one has it configured as an open wep connection </s>
<s> if i go to the advance settings and try to manually enter it as a wpa and enter the password it just wont connect </s>
<s> i am completely stumped as to why this wont work </s>
<s> the internet works when i plug the laptop directly into the router and when i remove security settings for the router </s>
<s> thing is i live in a heavily populated college area where everyone is trying to steal peoples internet so i can t leave it unprotected </s>
<s> any suggestions would be appreciated i feel like i ve tried everything at this point </s>
<s> reinstalling my wireless network adapter software as well thanks in advance </s>
<s> oops sorry </s>
<s> it appears the details are missing </s>
<s> sorry that was dumb of me it s a d link dir 616 router i m running windows xp on the affected laptop and the network adapter is a d link dwl g630 also this computer and network adapter both work fine if trying to connect to any other wireless network so it s not like faulty hardware is an issue </s>
<s> it looks like you set it up for a radius server </s>
<s> but i can t tell yet </s>
<s> focus on the router and be sure the router firmware is the latest since i ve seen this error where some machines connect and some don t </s>
<s> the poor owner couldn t accept it was out of date firmware so they ended up paying 2 companies to come look </s>
<s> the second one they let change the firmware </s>
<s> they wanted a refund from us </s>
<s> we said no </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t really know what that router firmware means or how to figure that out we did just get the router though </s>
<s> i saw the settings on my router for the wpa enterprise thing that said it uses a radius but that was not the option we selected </s>
<s> also how would that explain the reason my desktop connects wirelessly and it doesn t support the certificate settings </s>
<s> it s busted for sure </s>
<s> sorry but you may have to catch up on the wifi terminology and that quot new quot units ship with outdated firmware to solve this one </s>
<s> again been that done that and people are very confused about why it works on one machine but not the other and to them it looks like magic when i update the firmware set it up and it works </s>
<s> don t fret about it people are making good money on this situation </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> how do i go about updating the firmware then </s>
<s> i ve never learned any of this stuff because i ve never had a problem connecting before ever but i feel confident that i can do it i m definitely frustrated and determined </s>
<s> 1 you ve set it up our way at which includes updating the router </s>
<s> 2 you found google com and what others had to say about that message </s>
<s> if so it s dead and needs to be seen by someone first hand </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> why would i not set up a router with the same name as your router you elected to not share router details such as your ssid firmware version etc </s>
<s> so i could confound and confuse that person and maybe get them off the air </s>
<s> i d like to help but your post details are weak </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i didn t know anything about a firmware version until now </s>
<s> my ssid is three s company and the firmware version is 2 3 </s>
<s> with some drivers </s>
<s> now go back to a simple 6 to 8 letter name with just alpha characters </s>
<s> it s not a bug you find everyday </s>
<s> notes a 2 23 but no 2 3 i d install their latest at 2 24 to make sure you have all the fixes they give us </s>
<s> i ll use the manual from ftp ftp dlink com gateway dir615_revb manual dir615_revb_manual_220 zip see page 76 is this the setting you used </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i tried earlier plugging my laptop directly into the router and attempting to update the firmware </s>
<s> i downloaded the latest version 2 24 and when i attempted to open the file on the router page to load the new firmware version it didn t work and told me that the version i was attempting to upload may be corrupt and that the gateway would not be updated </s>
<s> i will attempt to change the ssid to something more simple </s>
<s> if downloads are showing up corrupt i d be scanning that machine for a download accelerators </s>
<s> b limewire </s>
<s> c p2p programs </s>
<s> d winsock hijackers see our spyware forum and other things </s>
<s> good hunting </s>
