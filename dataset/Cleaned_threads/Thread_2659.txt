<s> other which brand </s>
<s> i have no idea makes no sesne at all </s>
<s> of seagate maxtor and wd only seagate drives have never given me any trouble </s>
<s> my maxtors 4 in all had a habit of playing up when they got too warm probably because the circuit board just sat on a set of contacts and flexed with the heat </s>
<s> my wd s have had about a 30 failure rate </s>
<s> seagates </s>
<s> no failures </s>
<s> most of these drives are in use 24 hours a day and i ve even had seagate 500gb and 750gb drives in those fan free external usb cases with no problem at all </s>
<s> it s ghastly </s>
<s> not the person who put together this question </s>
<s> seagate is the best because of 3 little words five year warranty </s>
<s> they also have the highest ratings that i know of for impact threshold </s>
<s> so you may be able to throw them on the ground and have them still work although i wouldn t recommend it it voids the warranty </s>
<s> not to mention the fact that every single western digital drive i ve got now has a screwed up track 0 which means i can no longer use them as a master drive to put windows on </s>
<s> on another note i hope the it guy s responsible for mislabeling the topic have now been fired </s>
<s> now whenever i read your emails i m going to have to make sure you ve labeled the topics right basically make sure you know what you re doing </s>
<s> so shouldn t i be paid for doing your job </s>
<s> big time mistake </s>
<s> right now i am using seagate previously i used maxtor and in one pc that is seven years old my maxtor hard drive is still working perfectly </s>
<s> maxtor hard drives became unreliable when they got a contract with dell to supply drives for dell pcs </s>
<s> the quality of the drives got very bad because maxtor just couldn t keep up with demand </s>
<s> maybe now that seagate bought out maxtor maybe the quality will return to what it had been before the dell deal </s>
<s> seems like someone changed the poll question but not the answer selections or vice versa </s>
<s> the question that headed the poll that i received read which microsoft windows version would you consider the worst </s>
<s> please click on button to vote fujitsu why </s>
<s> hitachi why </s>
<s> ibm why </s>
<s> maxtor why </s>
<s> samsung why </s>
<s> seagate why </s>
<s> western digital why </s>
<s> other which brand </s>
<s> i have no idea </s>
<s> more importantly what kind of salary should i expect </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the email asks what version of windows do i consider the worst </s>
<s> that would obviously be vista but for some reason all of the answer choices are hard disk manufacturers </s>
<s> oh i see the question was supposed to be which brand of hard disk do i prefer </s>
<s> well i have never had a problem in the sense of drive failure lost data </s>
<s> however if i had to choose a brand it would be western digital because they have the best compatibility meaning they work with pretty much any computer or motherboard </s>
<s> i have a western digital hard disk in this computer and i am very happy with it </s>
<s> i like seagate drives </s>
<s> that s because seagate makes them well and because they have posted a utility that makes it possible to work on them fairly easily if they get off track </s>
<s> i m speaking of quot sea tools quot you can usually get the problem sorted out with that utility </s>
<s> it also works on maxtor drives </s>
<s> i like the western digital drives too but wd s utility is nowhere near as potent and useful as sea tools </s>
<s> if we are speaking of bad versions of windows how about vista </s>
<s> it is currently making people crazy </s>
<s> best version of windows </s>
<s> i like windows 2000 professional for its stability easy networking capability and its good looks </s>
<s> if only it could support the huge hard drives like windows xp sp1 and sp2 and vista </s>
<s> i used to be a wd loyalist </s>
<s> however after the 2nd wd hd meltdown in 2 years i switched allegiance to seagate </s>
<s> their 5 year warranty is definitely a major reason price and performance is another </s>
<s> as for wd i am also not happy with the warranty turnaround </s>
<s> took over 3 weeks to get my hd replaced but to give them credit they upgraded me from a sata to sataii same capacity to speed up the process a bit </s>
<s> however meanwhile i had picked up a seagate baracuda from a local merchant </s>
<s> now i have 2 seagates for my dual boot machine and i am using the wd as temp storage for misc downloads </s>
<s> we ll see if my confidence in wd will be regained </s>
<s> i ve been waiting for someone to realize that the manufacturer of your hard drive is far more important than what version of windows you re running </s>
<s> at least regarding performance </s>
<s> it s been my personal experience that the fujitsu s do not perform as well as maxtor and ibm </s>
<s> i ve had no problem with fujitsu when i m accessing media or data files </s>
<s> it s just those pesky os files it acts like a dog with </s>
<s> i think it may have something to do with the way fujitsu stores dll s </s>
<s> i m not sure but i m going to stick with my maxtor until fujitsu learns to store os files just like data files </s>
<s> how large are you talking about </s>
<s> i have 250 gig on mines right now with no trouble </s>
<s> i trust western digital and seagate the most and fujitsu the least mainly because i have never heard of it </s>
<s> u ve got to be kidding me </s>
<s> they are so far behind they cannot see their behind they are blind and evidently mirrors are all they are interested in </s>
<s> i have lost two count em 2 </s>
<s> western digital hard drives complete with all my data when they were less than a year old </s>
<s> i got em at different times and they were different sizes yet they both died without any indication whatsoever right in the middle of garden variety computing tasks no intense database work video editing or cd burning chores were being performed at the time they just crashed without warning the first i knew of it was the bsod which was also the last thing i knew as well </s>
<s> in both cases no data could be recovered from the discs not even professionally </s>
<s> now that s what i call crummy snake bitten turd rate hard drives </s>
<s> give me seagate any old day after that nightmarish experiece </s>
<s> i am maxtor fan had multiple drives managed two to kill one dropped second disconnected improperly but that was it </s>
<s> i had samsungs work related had three failures of four different drives </s>
<s> also since there are maxtor no more i got portable segate 300gb it works fine </s>
<s> the worst windows ever was windows millenium edition </s>
<s> 95 had it s initial issues as did 98 and xp was almost as bad as me was til sp2 came out </s>
<s> vista of course has it s own issues </s>
<s> for some reason i dont remember the issues with windows as bad with 3 11 and earlier </s>
<s> does anyone else </s>
<s> now for the hard drive question about 10 years ago i purchased a maxtor h d </s>
<s> in those days you paid 300 for a quot large h d quot approximately 20 30 gigs </s>
<s> it was horrible to install </s>
<s> and once installed within days the plates started slapping </s>
<s> so i exchange it </s>
<s> same thing </s>
<s> last time i trusted maxtor </s>
<s> i then exchange it for a western digital </s>
<s> easy install </s>
<s> actually the drivers installed so quick i wondered if it actually installed correctly </s>
<s> problem with wd however is every wd i ever owned went out within 2 years </s>
<s> im using seagate right now so we ll see </s>
<s> 5 year warranty sounds cool to me </s>
<s> if it doesnt last then i ll move on </s>
<s> i have no loyalty to hard drive companies </s>
<s> i have no use for maxtor </s>
<s> i used to make a liveing building pc s and repairing them </s>
<s> maxtor was nearly always the drive that failed </s>
<s> in my experience they have about on average a 14 to 18 month life span </s>
<s> and when they go they go hard fast and complete </s>
<s> seagate has been my choice of drive since the mid 80 s and for a while there was quantum </s>
<s> i have some seagates that are 120 megs in my oldest pc yeah i still run it occasionally that are still spinning just fine </s>
<s> when seagate bought maxtor it sent a chill up my spine i dont know what they are doing with it </s>
<s> time will tell </s>
<s> ted </s>
<s> if you want a hard drive with ibm technology in it i e the deskstar and ultrastar ranges these are now made by hitachi gst </s>
<s> ibm did a lot of r d in hard drive technology and were responsible for many breakthroughs but they were always competitive on price </s>
<s> i don t know if or how things might have changed since hitachi took over though </s>
<s> maxtor because i have been use hitashi and western digital and i found it thae best one </s>
<s> mainly because i ve never had one break on me in my 6 years of building </s>
<s> also when i was in shop in my high school there was a shelf with a bunch of old random hard drives pulled from various systems that still worked </s>
<s> take a guess what brand showed up the most </s>
<s> i mean i saw western digital caviars from 1992 that still worked lol </s>
<s> the question makes no sense </s>
<s> are we talking about hd s or windows o s </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> now the correct question appears quot which brand of hd do you trust most quot that makes sense </s>
<s> i like wd have a dell desktop 3yrs old use two external wd drives no problems with either and they are on at least 12 hrs </s>
<s> a day </s>
<s> i did have an omega external drive that crapped out after 1 1 2 yrs </s>
<s> i d go with wd </s>
<s> i ve built a lots of computers and used many types of hard drive s but i must say ibm drive have served me very well unlike the others </s>
<s> and now that hitachi has purchased them their even better with newer technology built into them </s>
<s> they are very smooth running very little noise if i were to rate hard drive manufactures it would be in this order hitachi western digital seagate maxtor </s>
<s> but this is my opinion only i have been a tech for 30 years i worked for a major company all this time when we got into computers in 1982 my company sent me to school for this type of training it needed to stay competitive so i think i know a little about quality </s>
<s> i got the wrong message </s>
<s> so my response was i don t have a clue </s>
<s> so the resulta are oing to be flawed </s>
<s> i ve had a whole slew of seagate drives fail me either doa or within two weeks of use </s>
<s> granted they were the bottom of the barrel 20gb and 40gb models but still if you want to be the best company you need to have quality across the whole lineup as evidenced by toyota </s>
<s> the cheap stuff should last just as long as the flagship hardware </s>
<s> currently i use wd caviar hard drives and i have no problems with them </s>
<s> i had a maxtor and in a short lifespan it blew itself out </s>
<s> i also have a 160 gb maxtor that is running in a usb and it s not performing too healthily </s>
<s> i had a samsung and while noisy as a vaccum cleaner </s>
<s> it lasted a very long time </s>
<s> hitachi and fujitsu drives are both good brands as well </s>
<s> same goes with toshiba </s>
<s> on a laptop hard drives don t last as long especially if the lappy runs hot </s>
<s> all of the above ran for about a year in my evil presario 2100 which eats hard drives on a yearly basis </s>
<s> the answer obviously is varied </s>
<s> however i started computer operating in early 60 s programming in mid 60 s in 70 s started repairing them in 80 s started building them so have a little experience in that line </s>
<s> my personal uses are early days was seagate and they went down hill and went to micropolis they were good drives tried fujitsu and didn t like them went to western digital and had too many failures </s>
<s> went to maxtor and have stuck with maxtor since the latter 80 s </s>
<s> however maxtor runs in cycles of lasting a good while and then failures frequently </s>
<s> i have recently gone to seagate again </s>
<s> however bought two 120 gigers at the same time one started scrambling things in about 6 months </s>
<s> the other currently is ok after two years </s>
<s> thought i d try hitachi and that is the first i ever had dead out of the box so wont try them again </s>
<s> will most likely stick to seagate even if they are slower ie ata 100 instead of 133 however i think that is changing in the sata side as the one i just bought has 3g capability </s>
<s> long story short they seem to run in cycles for brand failure rate </s>
<s> and for those that have the old drives i find they get so slow you can t tolerate them and buy another however we can say the work but not acceptable </s>
<s> they haven t failed as yet we just throw them away </s>
<s> i noticed the screw up but figured i d answer it anyway </s>
<s> i assume the question has to do with hard drives and my answer would be that maxtor has to be the worst </s>
<s> i have had a couple of them </s>
<s> one failed six months later the other failed in less than a month </s>
<s> i ve always preferred either seagate they ve been around a long time and good experience and western digital good experience with them </s>
<s> i have little experience with the others </s>
<s> on the motherboard you re using some prefer one type of drive some prefer others and yet again you ll get some that are best with any drive so the question is really irrelavent </s>
<s> the only way really is to look at the manufacturers website the only trouble is that they don t always give that information </s>
<s> that leaves back at sqaure one </s>
<s> failing any manufactuers information try pot luck </s>
<s> i can say though that maxtor drives seem to work well with more or less any motherboard designed for an amd cpu so possibly it s the cpu that decides what s best </s>
<s> i really would suggest you study how a computer works </s>
<s> no offense intended by any means </s>
<s> i have a 30gb maxtor bought at least 6 years ago that s still going strong </s>
<s> it s been in 2 different pc s and has been continuously running my os flawlessly </s>
<s> it s been a great drive </s>
<s> i also trust the western digital drives having owned 2 of them with no problems </s>
<s> i can t say that i don t trust seagate drives but i have had a problem with one and would think twice before buying another </s>
<s> they re consistently fast and i ve so far not had a single failure </s>
<s> i also have a pair of seagates inside my machine as well and they ve been dependable as well </s>
<s> now if the question was about the worst ever does anybody remember conner </s>
<s> i never had a broken hard drive in any of the computers i had </s>
<s> i used to have a 60gb fujitsu in my laptop which i upgraded to a 100gb hitachi </s>
<s> also i have a 160gb wd in my desktop and i have a 500gb mybook external hard disk from wd too </s>
<s> i had a seagate hd once and it was good too </s>
<s> had a 9 y o compaq presario with a 4gb seagate drive in it which was my first ever computer so i lived on that thing for years when i first got it </s>
<s> installing games uninstalling them to make room for new games that were meant to run on a system with more ram so the hdd went crazy reading writing to the swap file stuffing the o s up and re installing that that was one hard working hdd i finally gave that pc to my mum 2 years ago for word processing and web surfing and it still refuses to die i did an error check on it recently and there is not one bad sector on that hdd </s>
<s> when i build my next pc it will have seagate in it for sure </s>
<s> i refurbish old computers </s>
<s> by far the worst drive is an ibm </s>
<s> i have renamed their deskstar drives as deathstars </s>
<s> best i d have to say seagate then maxtor then wd </s>
<s> man people don t cut much slack for an honest mistake do they </s>
<s> i use mostly seagate </s>
<s> i think between my two computers i ve got three seagates and two western digitals ranging in size from 40 gb to 250 gb </s>
<s> i ve had trouble only with one of the wd s but that only after 5 years </s>
<s> so i guess i m a fan of seagate and western digital </s>

<s> let s call yours quot fat fingur quot heheh </s>
<s> i currently like the seagate most but like the fujitsu </s>
<s> fujitsu though does not have the ide sata drives any more </s>
<s> they specialize in scsi type drives </s>
<s> western digital has been pretty reliable for me and favored </s>
<s> the wd raptors have all been good but wouldn t buy a caviar right now </s>
<s> i had mixed luck with the old ibm deskstars or quot deathstars quot as i have heard them called </s>
<s> they were terrific drives as long as they worked they just didn t work long enough </s>
<s> i ve a couple from hitachi which took over the business from ibm </s>
<s> these have been decent </s>
<s> it s been at least 4 years since my last hd failure </s>
<s> i suppose just saying that will be the voice of doom </s>
<s> i remember conner they are now part of seagate and yes they were some of the worst </s>
<s> i have tried many different drives and samsung has always been a great drive fast reliable and quiet </s>
<s> though i understand they didn t start out so great they have come a long way </s>
<s> i think each company has a model or two that perform great the others are only built on a monday morning or friday evening </s>
<s> the only hdds i ve had real trouble with over the past ten years have been labeled ibm </s>
<s> the other brands listed in the question have never given me problems </s>
<s> i replace my hdds after two or three years though and i do daily backups </s>
<s> i don t trust any hardware </s>
<s> i have been using a samsung 60gb hard drive since early 2005 and it has never acted up </s>
<s> i have written terabytes of data in and out but its still going strong </s>
<s> thanks abhishek dexter quot mumbai india </s>
<s> based on personal experience i would trust the now long gone quantum and the still current seagate </s>
<s> i have some seriously old drives from these makers and they haven t missed a beat in operation </s>
<s> for laptop drives i would also include toshiba </s>
<s> great price reliable and great performance </s>
<s> from what i ve heard wd is the one to go </s>
<s> i ve been in desktop support for over 10 years now </s>
<s> while other hard drives escpecially quantum maxtor have died with real consistency i ve only ever replaced one seagate drive </s>
<s> they just plain work day after day year after year </s>
<s> you mention that ibm s were the only ones you had trouble with </s>
<s> let me say that as i have grown with the industry i have found that seagate drives were troubled through out the years </s>
<s> it seems that has been pretty well resolved </s>
<s> western digital and maxtor had their times with series of bad products </s>
<s> i think though over the years i found fujitsu to be one of the most reliable brands </s>
<s> brands that no longer exist like miniscribe conner quantum and micropolis were troublesome brands </s>
<s> conner was frequently dedicated to designs specifically for compaq machines so when you tried to use them in other machines problems occurred </s>
<s> a reference i found as follows may help establish the list you seek for the full article </s>
<s> randy here is the current list of top brands and worst drive models </s>
<s> this is based on the models we see the most and conversely the drives we see the least </s>
<s> we are in no way paid to recommend any particular brand or another </s>
<s> this is merely a statistical analysis based on the numbers of drives we see come through our doors for drive failure and data recovery </s>
<s> in no way does this guarantee that the top listed drive won t fail tomorrow or that what we feel is the worst one won t last you many years </s>
<s> this is really just a very simple guide for you to use in making a good decision about what drive to buy or to stay away from </s>
<s> if you continue reading you will find my own diatribe about the latest in the industry and a few things you may or may not be aware of </s>
<s> top brands 1 being best 1 seagate models since 1998 only cheaply made but getting much better </s>
<s> i never thought i would be putting seagate back on the top of the list but seagate now has the fewest failures of all the drives made now </s>
<s> they do make cheap consumer models but they also have a much better line of drives that cost a little more </s>
<s> your drive is not the item you want to try to save a buck on </s>
<s> 2 ibm notebook and desktop drives </s>
<s> there are issues with electro mechanical failures and or head crash on their high speed ide drives 40gb or greater </s>
<s> the 40 45 60 and 75 gb drives are really starting to go bad now especially the drives manufactured in late 2000 and all of 2001 these can go without warning so please keep them backed up </s>

<s> 3 fujitsu desktop drives only their 10 15 20 and 30gb desktop models have been failing left and right with either servo loss or electronic failure </s>
<s> notebook drives are only so so but are no longer manufactured </s>

<s> 6 quantum </s>
<s> has had a bad batch of drives with a defective chip incl </s>
<s> the fireball cx la lb lc and kx series </s>
<s> maxtor now owns quantum got them at a good price too </s>
<s> we have been seeing a large number of the quantum asxxxx series drives come in with missing outer servo especially the 40gb drives similar to the problem fujitsu has </s>
<s> this is an unrecoverable situation </s>
<s> beware </s>
<s> 8 samsung also known as trigem in e machines inexpensive you get what you pay for </s>
<s> cheaply made consumer use only but do a religious backup </s>
<s> 7 western digital they still haven t learned their drives are still failing left and right </s>
<s> cheaply made </s>

<s> don t get it </s>
<s> ibm may be the most reliable however thy are not the fastest </s>
<s> having worked for a manufacturer of aluminum disks for hard drives i know that fujitsu was the toughest specs to meet but their drives were the least reliable due to the large failures of their notebook size drives </s>

<s> in the past i have felt good about wd drives but in recent years they have lost their touch </s>
<s> in the beginning when i was working with 10mb drives i liked seagate and then they had their share of problems and some were good and others were well not so good </s>
<s> maxtor in the early days were super drives but when they bought out miniscribe and took on a new series of designs and were poor for a long time </s>
<s> each brand has had their ups and downs </s>
