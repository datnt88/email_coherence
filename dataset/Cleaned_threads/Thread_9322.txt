<s> bob thanks for your timely reply i have the problem playing the dvd movie with my rca tv dvd player as well as my magnavox vhs dvd phillips vhs dvd and ge dvd player playing through tv </s>
<s> again it doesn t happen with every movie i burn </s>
<s> sometimes the movie will play ok but will exhibit the problem the next time i try to play it </s>
<s> try the other type of dvd media </s>
<s> if you used dvd r try dvd r </s>
<s> also burn the media at 1 2 the media speed or 1 2 the drive speed whichever is lower to get the best results </s>
<s> i ll share i gifted 2 players because of this issue and replaced it with a philips dvd divx capable player </s>
<s> that one lists dvdr media so there is no question about support </s>
