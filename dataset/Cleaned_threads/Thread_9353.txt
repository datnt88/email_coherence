<s> hi guys i come across with very wiered problem i have a external hard drive with 40gb with two 2 20gb partitions </s>
<s> both partitions are showing only 1gb or 3gb free disk space </s>
<s> but there is only 4 83gb on first and 1gb of data normal or hidden on second partition i can see and rest of the data is invisible </s>
<s> i have tried digital rescue to recover but it didn t help </s>
<s> can anyone plz help me sort out this problem as i am unable to understand the real cause also i remember copying some data which is also invisible is there any software which can look for invisible not deleted data </s>
<s> any help or comments will be appreciated thanks sjunejo </s>
<s> the top of this very forum in the lost and found post notes many titles </s>
<s> but the one i want to give the first nod to is in quot the lacie miracle quot by booting that cd and without any knowledge of linux or installing any new software i can look at such drives and often see what is hidden from windows </s>
<s> but that does not mean i would delete such </s>
<s> many times these are recovery systems </s>

<s> hi bob i think you mean i should try to connect my drive to a linux pc will update you if i get it through but i don t remember plugging my drive into any linux machine ever anyway let s see regards sjunejo </s>
<s> if you can t find the top of this forum s top quot sticky quot post then here it is gt and no i did not write to connect the drive to a linux pc </s>
<s> the lacie miracle and other posts here note how to boot some linux from cd and use it without installing </s>
<s> it also tells you that no linux knowledge is required </s>
