<s> hi everyone </s>
<s> i posted a topic a while back about internet problems but i m back again </s>
<s> i m using a lg x120 netbook </s>
<s> my wireless router is dlink dir 601 </s>
<s> operating system windows 7 what happens is my internet stops working for gaps at a time </s>
<s> it will not disconnect but the page will stop loading and lead me to the cannot display page </s>
<s> when i posted my problems before here were some of the responses 1 reset your wireless router to factory settings then set it up again </s>
<s> i did this set it up as followed on the instructions still having the same problems </s>
<s> 2 make sure you are using wpa and not wep </s>
<s> i am </s>
<s> 3 make sure your firmware is up to date </s>
<s> there is nowhere on dlinks website to download a firmware update for the dir 601 </s>
<s> there is a webpage that lets me log into my router and it says i am firmware 1 00na </s>
<s> 4 try unplugging for 30s and plug back in </s>
<s> tried it still problems </s>
<s> here s something else that might help i am not sure when the internet does cut out and i get the error webpage i click the troubleshoot button and windows does its scan for errors type thing </s>
<s> this is usually what happens </s>

<s> internet now works again until next cut out </s>
<s> 2 scans </s>
<s> result dns server isn t responding </s>
<s> fixed </s>
<s> internet now works again until next cut out </s>
<s> 3 scans </s>

<s> internet now works until next cut out </s>
<s> please help me i am so frusterated </s>
<s> i am not only frusterated by my slow cutting out internet at my home but i am more frusterated at the fact that i don t know very much about computers and i can t fix this </s>
<s> thank you in advance for helping me out forum </s>
<s> has suggested settings </s>
<s> i can t find your router settings so here they are again </s>
<s> 1 router defaults </s>
<s> 2 wpa security </s>
<s> that s it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that s what you said last time and i just stated again in this topic that i ve done that and it hasn t fixed anything </s>
<s> when i log into my router and try to make changes and save it says quot this feature has been disabled on this emulator quot </s>
<s> this tells me you are not changing the router but the netgear or other emulator page </s>
<s> share the url of that router setup page for confirmation </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i login as admin and try to change the settings but anything i click will give me a quot this feature is disabled quot message </s>
<s> this explains why you haven t made the changes to your router </s>
<s> sorry but i would be guessing if your router is at this can vary but that s a common one </s>
<s> thanks for telling what you were doing </s>
<s> it explained a lot </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for taking the time to find type that link for me bob </s>
<s> i entered the settings from that url and found that i am using the newest firmware and using wpa </s>
<s> i changed it to wpa2 because it said something about stronger connection with it </s>
<s> so i guess everything looks good now </s>
<s> i hope so anyways </s>
<s> thanks again for your help </s>
<s> given the new attacks it may not be long till i have to upgrade the forum sticky from wpa to wpa2 </s>
<s> there is no need to panic yet but i do see the biggest problem is that not everyone wants to be their own it staff guru and dust bunny collector </s>
<s> hope all this helped you out merry christmas bob </s>
<s> hey bob it s happened again </s>
<s> my laptop disconnected twice tonight about an hour between the two times </s>
<s> my roommates laptop didn t disconnect at all </s>
<s> do you have a suggestion for a next step </s>
<s> 1 see if your machine has newer wifi drivers </s>
<s> 2 replace the wifi card </s>
<s> if you are running p2p downloads wifi is known to buckle </s>
<s> not much you can do for those that haven t learned to get wired for that use </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> got this router for x mas sigh nice thought but total absolute junk </s>
<s> to fix the constant disconnect 1 go into your router settings 2 click quot advanced quot tab up top 3 click quot advanced wireless quot tab on left 4 change the beacon period to 20 this will slow down the connection speed somewhat about 20 but will enable the router to hold a steady connection </s>
<s> wonder what is an adequate time period before i quot accidentally quot break it and get a new one </s>
<s> seriously total junk d link never should have put it on the market </s>
