<s> i am replacing the power source on an hp computer </s>
<s> had to order the replacement and it has a 4 pin video connector and the computer has a 3 pin connection </s>
<s> can i buy an adapter to convert the connector to a 3 pin or do i need to return the power source </s>
<s> the power source is smaller in size than usual thanks hp and finding a replacement has not been easy </s>
<s> thanks for any info you may have </s>
<s> butch </s>
<s> why no model numbers in your post </s>
<s> here s the forum tip that isn t showing up it seems </s>
<s> the computer is an hp pavilion 8533z the original power source is a delta electronics model dps 160gb a rev 00 hp p n 0950 3623 the p9 video </s>
<s> connector is a 3 pin connector one green 2 black wires the replacement is a micro atx 200w p4 12v model mps3atx20 the connector is a 4 pin connector 2 yellow and 2 black wires </s>
<s> all other connectors appear to be the same </s>
<s> quot only choose the 4 pin unit if you have the 4 pin plug connected to something in your pc otherwise you do not need it quot there may be extra connections that are never used </s>
<s> you didn t reveal if the 3 pin is used on the old setup </s>
<s> sadly i haven t found the service manual for that model but did find the note and clue above </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what makes yourpower supply an atx 12 v the 4 pin is the 12 volt power plug that many mobos use to power the cpu now </s>
<s> older mobos used the 5 volts or 3 3 volt connector it s a mobo issue not a cpu issue </s>
<s> a given cpu can be fed from the 4 pin 12 volt on a newer mobo and work without such a connector on a mobo not set up for that connector </s>
<s> had you plugged that in to the viseo card you would have fried video card for dinner </s>
<s> yellow wires are normally 12 volts of course black wires are grounds returns </s>
<s> i might guess that the greeen is for 3 3 volts however 3 3 volts is normally orange </s>
<s> the only green wire in the standard is the ps on lead on pin 14 of the 20 pin connector or pin 16 of the 24 pin connector </s>
<s> check with hp before plugging anything in </s>
