<s> hello i recently put in a new second hard drive because my c disk was full </s>
<s> my computer is a sony vaio i bought in 2001 i run windows xp </s>
<s> my question is i cant tell which of the disks in my computer is the new one </s>
<s> i bought the hard drive at a local computer store and it didnt come with any instructions or docs at all </s>
<s> it shows disk c d g and h the c i know isnt it </s>
<s> and the d i think it is a quot partition quot not really sure </s>
<s> my cd dvd is e f i need to format the new one i guess how on earth do i find my new one </s>
<s> and no i cant get any help from the place where i bought it he is not very helpful </s>
<s> thanks lizzie </s>
<s> some larger hd s won t work with older computers and operating systems but there are solutions available </s>
<s> what is the model name of the hd </s>
<s> what is your operating system and service pack </s>
<s> click start gt control panel gt administrative tools gt computer management double click storage gt disk management from there you can rt click any hd and initialize partition and format it </s>
<s> like linkit suggested get to disk management do a right click on one of the cds and change the drive letter to say quot r quot </s>
<s> then do the same to the other cd make it quot s quot </s>
<s> shut down the pc and disconnect the new hdd </s>
<s> then reboot the pc to to see how the drive letters show up you should have a quot c quot quot d quot plus an quot r quot and quot s quot </s>
<s> if this is the drive line up open explorer and right click on quot c quot on type in a name for quot c quot in the label box </s>
<s> do the same for quot d quot </s>
<s> now shut down again and reconnect the new hdd and see what shows up as other than quot c quot quot d quot or quot r quot and quot s quot </s>
<s> then you should be able to identify the new hdd and prepare partition and format it for use with your system </s>
<s> keep us posted vapcmd note the reason i suggest changing the cd rom drive letters to r and s is to avoid the confusion that develops when you add a new hard drive or hard drives to the system hdd takes precedence over the cds in drive letter assignments leaving unused drive letters beteween the hard drive s and the cd rom eliminates the cd rom drive letters from being bumped changed in the future </s>
