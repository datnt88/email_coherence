<s> sorry for if this sounds ludicrous but i wanted to troubleshoot as best as possible w as little headache as possible </s>
<s> i just finished building a new pc from scratch </s>
<s> when i went to plug in my monitor hp w2207h i see that the mobo accepts dvi and hdmi and the monitor has vga and hdmi </s>
<s> since there is no vga to dvi adapter i am thinking i may need a new monitor which is fine if this is the case </s>
<s> i tried to use the hdmi but the monitor says that is does not detect the hdmi input and goes to sleep </s>
<s> does something else need to be installed perhaps </s>
<s> i need a screen so i can access the bios and later install my os but as of now i can not get my current monitor to work with the new build </s>
<s> thoughts </s>
<s> like i said this sounds ridiculous and i feel stupid typing it but i ll take the heat </s>
<s> if i have to purchase a new monitor is there anything in particular that i should look for so that the monitor quot works quot without installing software etc </s>
<s> since this is a new build </s>
<s> thanks for any feedback that can be offered </s>
<s> trying to troubleshoot w as i said earlier as few headaches as possible </s>
<s> more than 1 hdmi input on the monitor </s>
<s> mine has 2 if i select the wrong input i get the same results your e getting </s>
<s> port on the monitor </s>
<s> use the osd setting of the monitor to select or default to hdmi instead of svga if that is the method of setting for use </s>
<s> be sure if required to save that setting as well </s>
<s> make sure by reviewing the manual for your monitor but a quick check of the osd should be enough </s>
<s> the same applies to your pc it may need to know where to output the video stream to that device </s>
<s> i checked manual on page 3 8 the hdmi supposely works as an output from an hdmi device like a player so it may not work as direct hdmi to hdmi but still the setting might be the fix regardless </s>
<s> the manual does offer an adapter should work </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
