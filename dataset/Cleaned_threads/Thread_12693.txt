<s> i have windows xp with ie6 sp2 installed </s>
<s> every once in awhile while trying to access abc com while the site page is still loading for some reason it completely shuts down my ie page </s>
<s> after a few attempts the page will load and i am good to go </s>
<s> this morning after 10 times of this happening i thought i would try to get an answer in this forum as to why this is happening </s>
<s> this is the only site that does this </s>
<s> i know i know as the doctor would say then don t do that anymore lol i would appreciate any help thanks sitnpritee </s>
<s> that web page is pretty video intensive as it usually has two or three animations running at the same time </s>
<s> what are the specs of your computer cpu graphics and ram mainly </s>
<s> also do you do any maintenance such as defrag the hdd and use disk cleanup </s>
<s> your computer may have just too many processes running in the background as indicated by the number of icons down by the clock </s>
<s> and lastly do you check for viruses trojans surfing junk malware pests </s>
<s> shows you a few old tricks that are still around </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i clicked on that link and it said dont view this page with java script enabled </s>
<s> i think it does have something to do with java though because after i posted i tried getting into that site with firefox and it disabled my java and i was able to get in </s>
<s> i still can not get in with ie thank you sitnpriee </s>
<s> cpu 2 66ghz ram 256 mb </s>
<s> i downloaded that aft and it cleans everything out ie temps cache cookies prefetch etc </s>
<s> and i use it daily </s>
<s> i defrag and scan disk weekly </s>
<s> i have no icons down by my clock except my zone alarm and my volume icon </s>
<s> i disabled all those things from my startup so i wouldnt have all those icons down there </s>
<s> since my first post i tried getting to that site with firefox and i had no problem </s>
<s> it has something to do with ie i think but i don t know what </s>
<s> thanks again sitnpritee </s>
