<s> i am a dedicated mac user </s>
<s> however i am also a data analyst </s>
<s> sometimes the programs i need to run analysis only comes in a windows version </s>
<s> i deal with stats data mining a little sql type stuff </s>
<s> i even need the windows excel due to add ins etc </s>
<s> my data is rarely over 10gb </s>
<s> most is far less than that </s>
<s> here is my question i am better off running a virtualization side on my mac ie parellels or to buy a windows desktop server load the windows programs into it and then remote desktop in from my mac </s>
<s> thus i am running the analysis process on the windows machine </s>
<s> upsides and downsides </s>
<s> comments </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> since i can save the state of the quot box quot i think it s an excellent solution </s>
<s> and here s a trick i use and want to share </s>
<s> let s say i want to use another machine </s>
<s> i copy my virtual box file over to that other machine and launch that virtual box machine without having to reinstall the windows in that virtual box </s>
<s> it s pretty amazing stuff </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i really love virtualization </s>
<s> i got vmware online coupons from shoppingspout </s>
<s> i didn t feel any problem while working on it </s>
<s> i am in the same situation with some of the apps i use for stats and data mining etc but i access my windows host over the internet from a mac </s>
<s> i decided against using virtualizing on my mac </s>
<s> anyway to remote in i use nomachine for windows and mac </s>
<s> i have to say for me it works like a charm </s>
