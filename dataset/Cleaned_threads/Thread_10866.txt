<s> i have created a workgroup for my two laptops which run windows xp home </s>
<s> i can see whatever it is i want to share on each of the computers </s>

<s> thank you </s>
<s> jeff </s>
<s> unsaid and cannot be fully answered until the details or your two node network are revealed </s>
<s> router wired wireless security enabled are all needed info </s>
<s> i am using a wireless router for my interenet connection to both computers which is unsecured </s>
<s> in which case your workgroup will be exposed when not protected by wep wpa and or mac filtering </s>
<s> you may wish to disable ssid broadcasting and change the default name and password of the router </s>
<s> my router is password protected but the ssid is not quot protected quot is that ok </s>
<s> turned on or off </s>
<s> i ve found that mac filtering is usually enough in most home environments since many will trip over wep wpa encryption </s>
<s> it is enabled wep is an open system and it says wep is disabled </s>
<s> to what has been suggested </s>
<s> have you enabled mac filtering this is the easiest and least troublesome of the security options in a router </s>
<s> enable mac filtering now and see what happens </s>
<s> i am checking the button only allow computers with mac addresses listed below to access the network </s>
<s> it then lists my computers in the dhcp client drop down list so i ll see what happens </s>
<s> thank you </s>
