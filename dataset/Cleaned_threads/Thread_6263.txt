<s> my c drive has 74gb ntfs but has only 15 gb left but my d drive has 55gb free out of 65gb </s>
<s> what do i need to do to utilise all my disk space and still access my files as if they were on c </s>
<s> vista 32 bit laptop </s>
<s> you can t access files on d exactly as file on c because the drive letter is different </s>
<s> so you would have to go to another drive </s>
<s> it s transparent if you move a folder like my documents via its right click properties that you don t access via a drive letter </s>
<s> but for all other files after moving the folder you ll notice the drive they are on is different </s>
<s> but that s only a minor difference </s>
<s> don t move files from the root folder program files windows other folders than my documents in your profile kees kees </s>
<s> two methods swap files over transfer or buy a larger hd </s>
<s> save your data to any media cd dvd of installed pgms </s>
<s> besides the os and its default pgms </s>
<s> once done and proper de install pgms reboot and then re install in drive quot d quot </s>
<s> you can then swap data to the new location etc once done you ve free up space </s>
<s> however just buying a new hd that say 250gb to replace your drive quot c quot </s>
<s> then use its own manufacturer s provided s w can transfer the whole old to new hd then remove old hd entirely </s>
<s> you gain more space and the system is more capable </s>
<s> in fact get a real large hd and replace both old drives as a 250gb and larger is very common now easily outstrips a 80 or 70gb old drive </s>
<s> buying a new hd is pretty simple with manufacturer s s w involved and using the instructions </s>
<s> review them at support websites to see what s involved </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks guys </s>
<s> i ve moved my documents but no progs or windows stuff to d and it appears ok but i accept the point about getting a bigger disk </s>
<s> pc magazine had released an utility called quot coa32 change of address 32 quot by neil j rubenking </s>
<s> it does what needs to be done to move the location of installed files in win xp </s>
<s> have been using it for years without any problem </s>
