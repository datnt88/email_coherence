<s> ok here s the deal </s>
<s> my home network consists of two laptops both sharing internet and files through my wireless router </s>
<s> i recently bought myself a 40gb external hard drive connect via usb for backing up my data from both laptops </s>
<s> i want to know if i am able to plug my external hard drive into my wireless router so both computers have access even if one is turned off </s>
<s> my first thought was somehow getting an ethernet to usb device </s>
<s> do these even exist and will they with the aim i have in mind </s>
<s> comments are greatly appreciated </s>
