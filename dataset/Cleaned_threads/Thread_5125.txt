<s> hi </s>
<s> fat 32 was not an option when i partitioned it </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> anyone know how to get that fat 32 option on a pc windows xp </s>
<s> also if i were to partition my drive on a mac os 10 what format would i partition it so that both platforms windows xp and os 10 both recognize my drive </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> when i partition if i keep the partitions under 32gb then i can format in fat32 or ntfs </s>
<s> your reply didn t tell much so i am unsure why you couldn t accomplish this feat </s>
