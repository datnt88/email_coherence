<s> hello can someone say something about amd athlon 64 not fx or x2 </s>
<s> bad good </s>
<s> is an amd athlon 64 3000 enough to play new games with with 1gb ram 128mb rather good graph card </s>
<s> should i buy a amd athlon 64 fx instead </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> is it worth it i m a bit short of money </s>
<s> mvh oskar r </s>
<s> are you building anew or upgrading an existing system </s>
<s> how much money are you willing to spend on a new processor </s>
<s> and a quot 128mb rather good card quot i dont see how it wont be able to play new games </s>
<s> probably better than me setup </s>
<s> 512mb of ram fx5200 </s>
<s> p4 no ht </s>
<s> and it can play nfsmw at the very lowest settings </s>
<s> but it can handle flight sim 2004 warcraft iii pretty good doom 3 at 800x600 on medium settings no aa pretty much everything on low settings </s>
<s> i would say get an amd 3800 dual core </s>
<s> not that expensive not that cheap </s>
<s> and it would be worth it </s>
<s> that can justify the fx price </s>
<s> there s a lot of the standard amd 64 s that are just fine for you </s>
