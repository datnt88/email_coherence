<s> ok well i got a brand new geforce 6800 gt oc and when i turned my computer on my monitor is sooo blurry </s>
<s> it looks like im looking at it without my glasses on all teh words ar e messed up and eveyrthing yesterday i messed witht he cord in the back of the monitor and noticed when its angled at a certian way the words stop being blurry but then i can see shadows of my mosue cursor icons and stuff and its onnying is my monitor going bad should i buy a new one </s>
<s> and my monitor is pretty dark no matter how high brightness is </s>
<s> i recommend trying it on another monitor to see if the problem follows </s>
<s> you did not say how your monitor worked b4 the new card </s>
<s> if you swap parts to isolate the problem you can often narrow down the problem area to find a solution </s>
<s> if the same prob shows on another monitor that would indicate not a monitor specific prob </s>
<s> the same for video card cables and drivers </s>
<s> if you use extra video cable reduce it to the only the orginal vga cable check results </s>
<s> if the problem persists then use that warranty now </s>
<s> of course try to adjust the monitor for best results otherwise you have a bad monitor maybe caused by shipping etc </s>
<s> cjeck also for any bent pushed otherwise odd looking pins on all the vga cable s </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> i already rma ed my video card and they sent me a brand new one againa nd its still doing it </s>
<s> you ve already gotten some good suggestions like swapping things around </s>
<s> fwiw i ll add the following </s>
<s> what size monitor is it </s>
<s> is the video cable built in or does it plug into the monitor </s>
<s> when i got this 19 inch monitor i found that text was kind of blurry </s>
<s> there was a sort of ghost effect </s>
<s> this may be similar to what you ve been seeing </s>
<s> i can t tell </s>
<s> the cable on this monitor is not built in and the cable i was using was pretty lightweight and not well shielded </s>
<s> when i replaced it with a quot heavy duty quot shielded video cable the problem cleared right up </s>
<s> if your problem started when you changed video cards maybe the signal on the new video card isn t quite as strong as the old card or something so you need a better cable </s>
<s> if your video cable plugs into your monitor you might try a new quot heavy duty quot and shielded video cable </s>
<s> especially if you have a large monitor since they apparently require a better video signal </s>
<s> cables like this can be had fairly cheap </s>
<s> i got this one on ebay for around 12 as i recall </s>
