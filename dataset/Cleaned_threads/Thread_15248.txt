<s> hey i have a dell computer bottom of the line we wont even mention it but anyway the hdd is only 40gb and well that isnt that much room </s>
<s> i went in to disk management and it says there are 2 partitions on my hdd </s>
<s> one is my normal c drive which has 34gb and there are only 5 left haha </s>
<s> the other is 3gb fat32 partition and it even says in parenthesis unknown partition </s>
<s> is this safe to delete </s>
<s> that partition contains the restoral files for the computer </s>
<s> delete if you want to but you ll never be able to restore the pc in case of a failure </s>
<s> it seems to me u don t know what fat32 is </s>
<s> i think wikipedia org will explain it better than i ll do </s>
<s> maybe after that u ll understand meaning and purpose of it and will change ur mind </s>
<s> anyway if any questions arise do not hesitate to ask </s>
<s> regards </s>
<s> actually my hdd is just formatted all in ntfs </s>
<s> i m not using fat32 for anything at all except backup files </s>
<s> and there s no point in deleting my backup files now because i can t exactly merge the 2 partitions </s>
<s> what is the model number of your dell computer </s>
<s> did the computer come from dell with the fat32 partition </s>
<s> have you confirmed whether that partition is a restore partition </s>
<s> a hard disk that full will lower overall system performance </s>
<s> that is why it may be a good idea to purchase a larger hd </s>
<s> if you don t want a new one i would backup all important files to cd dvd or whatever external storage you have and perform a fresh installation of windows xp </s>
<s> during the installation you will have the option to remove all partitions </s>
<s> create one partition and install windows xp </s>
<s> mission accomplished </s>
<s> do you have the dell windows xp restoration cd </s>
<s> do you have the dell driver cd </s>
<s> you need these discs </s>
<s> i dont wanna reformat and whatnot </s>
<s> so for now i can t really do much i have cleared up some space though </s>
<s> one of these days i will grab a new hdd but that requires money haha </s>
<s> maybe i m confused here </s>
<s> what is it that you want to do </s>
<s> if you want to resize or delete a partition that will always run the risk of damaging the os installation and if damaged it is likely you will need to reinstall everything </s>
<s> if you want to pay money to resize delete the partition partition magic will do it </s>
<s> otherwise removing the second partition by using the windows xp cd is free but you will have to reinstall the os drivers all programs and personal files </s>
