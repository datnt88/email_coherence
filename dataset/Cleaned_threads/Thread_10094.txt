<s> im looking for advice on the nas220 by seagate before purchasing </s>
<s> i am looking to know how this device handles streaming movies and music to xbox units and if it can do this without any issues when acting as a media server </s>
<s> any advice and support is welcome especially if any members have this nas drjve and use it in the same manor as i intend to </s>
<s> sorry it failed </s>
<s> all nas devices have issues </s>
<s> if not the device itself then the owner s network and the players of the content </s>
<s> there is no known issue free solution today </s>
<s> i wish you had not made this question such an easy one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok is there any media servers that are up to the job </s>
<s> shame about the nas drives </s>
<s> again none </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> because i am seeing folk get content from let s say the internet and the encoding is all over the map these media servers only support a small percentage of possible encoding so there will be issues </s>
<s> can you share why you made this such an easy question </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so in short we are being mislead with false advertising such as these devices being able to perform when infact they dont </s>
<s> all i am looking for is a sound device that allows me to share media files to other connected devices on my network seems like i am fighting a loosing battle </s>
<s> the questions are so easy if you already know the answers </s>
<s> if you never ask then how do we learn </s>
<s> a fundemental learning curve </s>
<s> can you offer any solutions to my issue </s>
<s> would like to have this capacity on my network but now realise nas drives are not the answer </s>
<s> i am currently using a netgear dgnd3700 router but the ready share feature i am not to convinced with either ie supporting a 2 tb external hard drive </s>
<s> sorry that i made it sound easy </s>
<s> you asked great questions and were spot on when you declared that the marketing made it sound like it all works </s>
<s> the dgnd3700 is not a bad choice but as we not you but somewhere on this forum discovered isn t perfect </s>
<s> one cnet member was having issues with the nas feature and their xbox 360 we did some searching and discovered we had to fiddle with a setting </s>
<s> this means that even this failed the quot without issue quot test </s>
<s> as to the 2tb drive size netgear should answer that </s>
<s> my take is that most folk are put off by the mess of encoding and the rather sluggish file transfers </s>
<s> that is they are used to much faster transfers </s>
<s> for example if you can wait half a hour for that video to copy up to the nas then you ll be ok on that aspect </s>
<s> then we have the encoding of the content to cover </s>
<s> the player if a pc is pretty capable but today i find folk trying to play it on some hdtv and then the truth is revealed </s>
<s> or the owner learns about video encoding transcoding and lip sync </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> for the hdtv player it s a logitech revue </s>
<s> for the nas it s some netbook low power capable and cheap </s>
<s> for the other content i usually plug it right into the revue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> happy days thats what im looking for </s>
<s> even though what i use now has a long history of things that didn t work out the old roku hd some htpc too many quot media players quot i am looking to change this working system some day </s>
<s> i m considering the sony google tv since it has a bd player </s>
<s> just want to test it </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> 1 the bd player </s>
<s> 2 it s 1080p versus the revue s 720p </s>
<s> the revue is working well but i wonder if it can be better </s>
<s> the boxee seems to get good reviews but i haven t tried it yet </s>
<s> and strange i haven t seen one in the stores here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i took the plunge was about to purchase a 5tb nas drive but opted for a cheaper trial device got the seagate goflex 2tb product and have to say thus far no problems whatsoever all my music movie files are available through any dlna device that i have connected to my network happy as can be just hope this lasts </s>
