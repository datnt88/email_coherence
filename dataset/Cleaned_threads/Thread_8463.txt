<s> hi my wireless connection on my laptop gets lost whenever i receive phone call </s>
<s> do you know the reason </s>
<s> also how do you use quot pc card quot on a desktop computer </s>
<s> is it just for laptops </s>
<s> i m planning to add a wirelles adapter to my desktop pc specifically quot microsoft mn 730 quot </s>
<s> which one do you recommend usb adapter or pci adapter </s>
<s> i ll bet you 500 that you have a 2 4ghz cordless phone </s>
<s> move the base and or handset as far from the router and pc cards as practical or get a 900mhz or 5 8ghz model instead </s>
<s> the wi fi operates at 2 4ghz </s>
<s> i agree captaincraig as a 2 4 ghz very definitely interfere with a 802 11b most common wireless network as they both work in the same frequency range </s>
<s> as for the pc card it can be used on a desktop but it requires a special pci card be installed inside the desktop </s>
<s> as for the microsoft adapters either should work equally well </s>
<s> the usb adapter is easier as it s external </s>
<s> wi fi networks work on 2 4 ghz range so if you have a 2 4 ghz phone you will lose the connection because the network and phone will conflict with one another </s>
<s> as for the other things i don t know enough to give you sound advice </s>
