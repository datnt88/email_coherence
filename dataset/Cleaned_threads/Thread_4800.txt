<s> i had to send my computer out to geek squad due to it wouldn t start </s>
<s> they replaced my video card for which it took them 5 weeks and i finally got it back last week </s>
<s> now my computer is booting and running very slowly and my usb 2 0 ability has disappeared and i only have usb 1 0 abilities </s>
<s> it is taking my 160 gig ipod 5 x s as long as normal to sync </s>
<s> anyone who can unlock this mystery would be very much appreciated </s>
<s> if working before but not after i d take it back </s>
<s> i m sure the long wait the last time would make you hesitant but you should at least call it to their attention and mention it came back to you with a problem it didn t have before </s>
<s> see what they say </s>
<s> good service should always include a thorough test before returning something to a customer </s>
<s> you don t just fix what s broken and hand it back </s>
<s> you look for other problems and advise the customer of these while the product is in your hands </s>
<s> but without make model versions of drivers the os this conversation can t start </s>
<s> are you seeing the words in red today </s>
<s> make acer model m5630 u5052a version of drivers usb root hub is microsoft 6 0 6001 18000 usb universal host controller is intel 8 2 0 1008 os windows vista w service pack 1 </s>
<s> i just used the restore dvds on an acer </s>
<s> try that next </s>
<s> if you have the restore recovery cds use them to reload the usb ability and or drivers </s>
<s> if you don t have them then inquire at acer there maybe a small cost or argue for them as you didn t get them </s>
<s> its avaluable item to have regardless </s>
<s> the cd should provide a menu item to load usb directly if not then the acer support website should provide them </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> a hard drive had previously crashed on my acer and i made the mistake of having a good friend install vista on a new hard drive so my system is no longer considered acer oem and they say there is nothing they can do to help me </s>
<s> head to acer for motherboard and more drivers </s>
<s> here s the rub acer is your primary support website for the quot product brought quot </s>
<s> once you devived from that you pretty much are on your own </s>
<s> vista has the nasty habit of not providing any or on a timing basis the drivers or s w required to run on your system </s>
<s> not just acer but any oem build one </s>
<s> it just harder so you have to surf and match your device to the proper driver </s>
<s> in the case of usb the xp if that what you had originally should be capable of driving vista </s>
<s> the rub also exists that the os itself provides drivers and shouldn t need any </s>
<s> but some chipsets maybe better driven by the oem supplied drivers </s>
<s> goto or any other usb help website and find a possible driver for your mtrbd </s>
<s> usb chipset just be sure what you have </s>
<s> it maybe via nec or other brand so match what is needed </s>
<s> if you check under the device mgr </s>
<s> it should post what usb hub is present and go from that </s>
<s> adios willy </s>
<s> but i m in the usa </s>
