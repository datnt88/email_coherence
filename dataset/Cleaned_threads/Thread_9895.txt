<s> i am running a home built intel pc </s>
<s> i have a gigabyte ga p35 ds3l motherboard running an intel core 2 duo e4400 2 00ghz </s>
<s> i currently have 2 1 gig sticks of ocz pc2 6400 800 mhz dual ch ram </s>
<s> the timing on those sticks is listed as 4 4 4 15 i couldn t pass up a good deal that i got online for 2 more 1 gig sticks for only 19 99 after rebate </s>
<s> they area also ocz pc2 6400 800 mhz dual ch ram </s>
<s> i didn t realize when i purchased it that they have a different timing of 5 5 5 when i put all 4 in windows xp professional crashes </s>
<s> i understand that with the 32 bit version i will never see all 4 gigs but 3 would be nice </s>
<s> my motherboard does have the ability to manually set the ram timing </s>
<s> i tried that and i am still getting crashes </s>
<s> i also took out the old ram and just booted off the new stuff to make sure i didn t get a bad stick </s>
<s> it worked fine </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea how to get this working </s>
<s> this is the first computer that i have ever built </s>
<s> if i can t get it working it looks like these sticks are going on ebay </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> to 5 5 5 15 or use fail safe settings </s>
<s> you may also want to increase your ram voltage a bit </s>
<s> if all 4 boot fine then try to speed up to 4 4 4 15 and then 4 4 4 12 once you re able to boot ok be sure to run a memory test to stress the system and ensure stability </s>
<s> mtrbds </s>
<s> become picky when all ram slots are used </s>
<s> it really pays to have matched sets of ram and or similar types </s>
<s> while you have very similar type you don t have true matched pairs and you see the result </s>
<s> if you have tweaked the ram at all return or reduce ram demands abit in order to lessen speed hopefully it can recover </s>
<s> you can play with the setting but start at more safe level then tweak up </s>
<s> further you have the os limits and that may come into play </s>
<s> then on top of that the mtrbd </s>
<s> may need a bios update see if one is available for such a cure and quot what it does quot </s>
<s> what happens when only 3 sticks are installed </s>
<s> try with the new sticks alone what happens </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i tried it with 3 sticks </s>
<s> i made it into windows and started working </s>
<s> it crashed in about 5 minutes </s>
<s> 3 gigs were showing up at that time </s>
<s> i also tried just putting in the brand new sticks and taking out the old sticks </s>
<s> the computer booted fine with just the new ones </s>
