<s> i am looking to buy a bluetooth device that can be connected to a desktop computer and used to send out text messages and multimedia to cell phones within a range of 500 meters or more </s>
<s> i am not familiar with this type of technology so i m not sure what type of device i need to purchase or where i could purchase it </s>
<s> any recommendations would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> sorry but that 500 meters is beyond most bluetooth devices </s>
<s> yes you might jury rig a base station or such but the device you try to talk to can t respond </s>
<s> maybe you need to reveal more since the bluetooth speed is far too slow for video files </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> stlcardsfan13 have you found a means to do this </s>
<s> i am interested in doing the same thing to distribute multiple text messages for a new media art piece </s>
<s> i am running a mac osx </s>
<s> i am also hoping that when people respond to this text message on their mobile phones it uploads to an online blog like twitter </s>
<s> any suggestions would be great </s>
