<s> i have a 6 yr old hp pavillion desktop </s>
<s> this computer shuts down without warning </s>
<s> sometimes i can restart </s>
<s> sometimes it won t restart for hours </s>
<s> i think its overheating but cannot proof this ther </s>
<s> i have opened the case to keep it cooler but it still shuts off </s>
<s> some days it does not shut off </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> besides opening case clean it out and blow out any dust build up etc further make darn sure all fans are working 100 not intermit </s>
<s> makes ure the psu fan itself is running if itsn t it won t be apparent and the psu becomes weak and cuases power problems plus it may blow </s>
<s> also verify the cpu hsf heatsink is ok not dangling at an quot angle quot or such because it must be fully in contact with the cpu to disperse heat and do its job in other words don t take anything for granted check it </s>
<s> finally being 6yr </s>
<s> old it could be on its last legs and showing that the psu just has degraded to a point to become quot iffy quot and replacement is the real cure </s>
<s> further all componets together due to age taht any one componet is dragging down and being old system it won t take much </s>
<s> however you probably have a weak psu rep lace it </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> thanks willy i just went through a recovery cycle and was putting xp back on over an old windows 98 when it shut down in the middle of installing xp </s>
<s> is there a fan that will fit over the cpu </s>
<s> is the psu plugged into the mother board </s>
<s> rkillgore </s>
<s> psu power supply unit hsf heatsink fan setup the power supply psu can get old and degraded and simply behave as you described though it could be another problem i m betting possibility on the psu being flaky </s>
<s> further a hsf over the years can creep away or fall abit due to gravity and heat cold cycles of running on off </s>
<s> you should inspect closely to see or simply reseat the whole hsf setup </s>
<s> this is located on the cpu itself </s>
<s> depending on your model hp you may or not have a secondary fan blowing on or away for greater cooling effect of the cpu it may also be just a platstic tube or tunnel to allow the cpu fanm outside air </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
