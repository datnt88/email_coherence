<s> i have been satisfied with my linksys cm100 cable modem and linksys wrt54g wireless router about 22 mbs down and 1 mbs up </s>
<s> security settings were pretty straightforward and the setup worked well with homedns for my webcams in my old dell e520 xp system </s>
<s> last night we had a power surge that fried the computer and the cable modem </s>
<s> i got a temporary replacement modem but apparently the wireless router was also hit so i will have to replace both </s>
<s> my question is whether there is any reason to move to a more modern system or possibly a combo modem router </s>
<s> someone recommended a motorola sbg 6580 but i m wondering if i would likely see any real improvement in performance and whether i would just be asking for setup headaches </s>
<s> right now i am leaning towards trying to find identical replacements but i would welcome any suggestions </s>
<s> lt div gt lt div gt charles lt div gt lt div gt </s>
<s> i was also looking at the linksys e1200 or e2000 or e4200 as a replacement for the wrt54g </s>
<s> would one of these be a more modest upgrade </s>
<s> first question would be does your isp use or plan to use docsis3 </s>
<s> you fried modem does not support this </s>
<s> of course you also have to ask if they charge extra to use this feature </s>
<s> if all your equipment is g band then you will see little difference in any of the linksys routers you mention </s>
<s> the primary difference is if you need wired gig streaming hd video inside your house would be a example or if you need to run on the 5ghz band your pc would need a wireless card that was compatible </s>
<s> do you buy a combo router modem is a tougher question </s>
<s> it will generally be cheaper to buy a combo but your selection of feature and brands is somewhat limited </s>
<s> you also of course would need to replace the unit if you changed technology say to dsl fios uverse </s>
<s> since the amount of money is not huge i would go for separate units since you can pick the features that meet your needs the best </s>
<s> the sbg6580 is a combo modem wireless router which means if one side goes out you replace the whole thing </s>
<s> if you like the mororola modems why not go with a stand alone modem like the sb 6120 or sb 6121 modem they are all docsis 3 0 and then get a stand alone n wireless router </s>
<s> if your ip is comcast and you are in a docsis 3 0 area you will see a improvement because you will have 4 bonded channels down which gives you more constant speeds </s>
<s> you may end up spending a little more initially but i have heard they have problems with the combo units </s>
