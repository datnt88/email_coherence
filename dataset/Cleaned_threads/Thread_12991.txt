<s> my dad s computer compaq evo d500 running windows xp home edition was having some operating system problems on which we had exhausted all other options so we backed up his person files and formatted and reinstalled windows </s>
<s> we got almost everything working fine pretty quickly </s>
<s> the computer is almost always connected by wire which works perfectly fine right now but when we have company we don t like having a long wire laying on the floor so we like having the wireless available </s>
<s> we ve had this wireless card zonet zew1602 in for almost three years and we haven t had a problem till now </s>
<s> the first time we got it we plugged it in and it worked instantly </s>
<s> we formatted and reinstalled with the card still plugged in and when we installed the software after the reinstall the wireless client configuration utility says there is no card plugged in </s>
<s> i am somewhat computer savvy but i m more of a software problem kind of guy so i don t have too much experience with such problems </s>
<s> we have looked into the device manager and we don t see anything of such a name as the wireless card </s>
<s> i tried the add hardware and it didn t find anything </s>
<s> i tried going into bios to see if there was anyway to enable the card but i couldn t find anything </s>
<s> any help to getting the wireless card working would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> while i found no on off feature for the card at i continue to encounter bad xp installs </s>
<s> missing drivers or folk that had no install plan </s>
<s> did you quot install xp quot or did you use the hp compaq restore media and driver cd </s>
