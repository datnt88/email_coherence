<s> as a newbie can anyone tell me what a parition is and why do i need them </s>
<s> if i don t need them how do i get rid of them expecially if they take up memory </s>
<s> how can i view the paritions in my computer </s>
<s> windows xp </s>
<s> there are long discussions and old tales that are nothing but urban rumor that partitions make a machine run faster or quot save quot your files in case you have to reinstall the os </s>
<s> i ve found that to be false </s>
<s> what s the goal here </s>
<s> you can with google research what a partition is but for now why change what you have </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i googled partition but really never understood why i need them </s>
<s> a blank hard disk is just a pile of quot sectors quot there is no organization so a partition is made so a file system can be held there </s>
<s> there are long passages about how a file system works but i ll end with writing quot yes we need that quot bob </s>
<s> hi lynn a simple way to describe it would be like you buy a harddisk of 500gb for your computer </s>
<s> 1 create one big partition will give you c drive with 500gb 2 create e g </s>
<s> two partitions will give you c drive with e g </s>
<s> 60 gb and a d drive with the remaining 440gb </s>
<s> actual drive space will be less but its easier to understand this way </s>
<s> the advantage of creating partitions like in example 2 is if you only use c for your os and to install applications and drive d to store all your data you can format the c drive and reinstall your os without moving your data on the d drive </s>
<s> in this way your computer will get more organized not faster nor safer </s>
<s> but remember </s>
<s> if the harddisk crash both drive c and d will be lost </s>
<s> a partition is an area of the physical disk dedicated to an operating system according to the file system hierarchy </s>
<s> what the previous person stated isn t true </s>
<s> windows uses a style of partitioning that is similar to the default bsd style of quot slicing a disk quot you are not creating partitions you are creating dedicated areas within the partition </s>
<s> there is no c or d drives in the layout of the master boot record </s>
<s> you only have four primary and if you want more then you must only create three primary and have number four separated into logical sections </s>
<s> you cannot resize a partition from within itself and you cannot do such without permissions as the root user </s>
<s> you view the partitions with fdisk </s>
<s> if you want to resize then use an external device such as a live cd or a usb installed os </s>
<s> i suggest knoppix </s>
