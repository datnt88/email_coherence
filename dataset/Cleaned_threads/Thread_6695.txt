<s> thanks quot temu you didn t state if date needed to be moved so this will be easy </s>
<s> just use a nice 80 conductor ide cable set both drives to cable select and plug the drive pair into a primary ide channel </s>
<s> you may need to set the bios to autodetect the drives and a bios update might be required if the drives are beyond the supported size </s>
<s> install your os pull your files from backup and store the scsi stuff for a rainy day if you want to recover some forgotten file </s>

<s> quot just use a nice 80 conductor ide cable set both drives to cable select and plug the drive pair into a primary ide channel quot does this quot generally quot work </s>
<s> or does it depend on the mobo </s>
<s> i have an intel d845bg mobo and hdd is set as master </s>
<s> if i were to add another hdd could i set them up either way master slave or cable select </s>
<s> and is there any advantage of one setup over the other </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the 80 conductor cable does the select and using the higher quality higher speed cable sidesteps a few issues i ve seen over hair loss trying to install the os </s>
<s> the rules are simple in ide land </s>
<s> just try it </s>

<s> has master and slave printed on it which is what concerned me </s>
<s> now i m guessing that it means master and slave for cable select or for normal settings </s>
<s> jumpered in a hdd from an quot antique quot compaq about a month ago to copy some files and set it to slave </s>
<s> all worked fine so guess the main hdd is set as master </s>
<s> i ll try it as cable select when i get the new drive but may have to get a new power supply first </s>
<s> have a 300 watt supply now supposedly certified for p4 and athlon but don t want to push it </s>
<s> appreciate the reply </s>
