<s> i recently purchased a dynex 2 port usb 2 0 card for my desktop at home </s>
<s> looking at the system requirements it needed an os from win98se to windows xp sp1 no mention of sp2 </s>
<s> i didn t think that was a big deal at first </s>
<s> i installed the card and when i rebooted windows windows xp went through the whole quot detected new hardware quot thing in the lower right hand corner of the screen </s>
<s> i even installed the driver cd that came with the card </s>
<s> a couple of days later i tested out the new card by plugging in a flash drive into it </s>
<s> no response </s>
<s> i plugged the flash drive into one of the old usb 1 1 ports and the flash drive came on just fine </s>
<s> i wouldn t have thought there would be a huge technological difference between sp1 and sp2 </s>
<s> i thought the service packs only dealt with security issues </s>
<s> i m going to put the usb card on a win98se machine that i have that i use for emergencies and to play old pc games to see if the card works there </s>
<s> was there issues in the past with some hardware not working when moving from sp1 to sp2 </s>
<s> i currently have windows xp home that came with sp2 </s>
<s> but let s check something first </s>
<s> tell me which motherboard driver package you are using </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> xp os doesn t supply usb drivers though it may have in earlier releases </s>
<s> that s a function of the mtrbd </s>
<s> support cd or usb driver from the support website </s>
<s> plus it has to be enabled in bios </s>
<s> then you have to if so supplied install the usb cards own driver i have found some cheaper usb cards or devices simply problematic and only the quot generic usb quot driver does any good from the website </s>
<s> check all that fyi sp2 dealt with alot more than security but it should also include sp1 or portions needed as part of the total install package </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> after the computer was re booted a few times the usb 2 0 card decided to work on my win xp machine </s>
<s> i m not entirely sure why it finally decided to work but i m happy it did </s>
