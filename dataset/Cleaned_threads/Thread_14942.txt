<s> i have a 10 gig hd not in the computer which i would like to get the music off of and clear everything else off of it and put it into a new built computer sometime later </s>
<s> is there a cable i can purchase to connect the hard drive to a usb port to download the music files into another hard drive and wipe the hard drive clean for use in another machine </s>
