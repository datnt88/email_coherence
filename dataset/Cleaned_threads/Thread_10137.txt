<s> ok so i am trying to figure out whether to set my internet connection through my linksys router as quot keep alive quot or quot connect on demand quot </s>
<s> i had it on connect on demand but during an online game it kept thinking the connection was idle so it would disconnect messing up the game </s>
<s> so i set it up on keep alive well it would keep the connection but everytime it wasnt used for a few hours it would disconnect and i have to go into router settings and reconnect manually </s>
<s> what should i do </s>
<s> what model router </s>
<s> try downloading the latest firmware </s>
<s> it sounds like your router software sucks </s>
<s> dial on demand is pretty self explanatory </s>
<s> any packet destined for the internet constitutes quot demand quot </s>
<s> there should also be some quot idle timer quot settings that are used to disconnect the router after some time of no traffic </s>
<s> setting these to 0 usually means never hang up </s>
<s> some isps automatically disconnect you after many hours to prevent you from setting up a mail or ftp server </s>
<s> you might try rebooting the router before a really long gaming session to get a fresh login and restart the isps timer if you think it is your isp screwing with you </s>
<s> check you ip address on the router once a day and see if it is changing </s>
<s> skrall </s>
<s> thats the model number </s>
<s> it is currently running firmware version 1 00 6 when going to the linksys site they have 5 6 different quot versions quot of my router </s>
<s> how do i know which version i have </s>
<s> i tried putting a 0 in under the idle time but must be greater than 1 i am thinking the losing of the connection must be someting to with the internet because the wireless signal usually remains at a constant 54 mbps without dropping </s>
<s> look on the bottom of your router to get the version </s>
<s> ok so i got the version number and downloaded the latest firmware </s>
<s> so we shall see what happens </s>
<s> thanks for your help guys </s>
<s> so i downloaded the latest firmware and put the setting on keep alive </s>
<s> it is still dropping the connection sometimes </s>
<s> i even set my laptop up using an ethernet cable to see if it was wireless signal interference </s>
<s> so that can t be the case </s>
