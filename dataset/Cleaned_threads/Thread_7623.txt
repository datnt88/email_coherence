<s> first you must excuse me if my terminology is not accurate </s>
<s> i purchased a house that is wired with 16 ports </s>
<s> i have a cable modem that sends the signal to the switch which then feeds the house and a wireless router i believe it is router first and then switch but not sure </s>
<s> i would like to be able to hook up my printer to one of the ports and print remotely from laptop wireless or from a desktop computer that is physically connected to one of these ports </s>
<s> i m not even sure where to start and i don t want to have to sift through numerous web pages and terminology i don t understand </s>
<s> any assistance is much appreciated </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> if i had a cable modem to my switch and to the house then not much would work proper </s>
<s> if i wired my cable modem to the router then router to switch to the house then that s the common working setup </s>
<s> i will not help people with the first setup since that s their choice and their headache </s>
<s> i hope you understand why </s>
<s> to place the printer on the proper network you need a pc that shares the printer or one of dlink linksys s printer sharing boxes </s>
<s> your choice </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you may network a printer through a switch </s>
<s> now you mentioned your house having 16 ports </s>
<s> i must presume you have something like a patch panel which has cabling from it to various places in the home </s>
<s> right or wrong </s>
<s> a switch would be placed near the patch panel perhaps both in a common rack </s>
<s> the jacks of the switch would be wired to those of the panel </s>
<s> this becomes a common network quot hub quot site </s>
<s> in this same location you might have a cable or dsl modem </s>
<s> it would connect to the switch through a router </s>
<s> the router is the device that connects the quot wan quot wide area network to the quot lan quot local area network </s>
<s> in this case the wan is the internet and the lan is your home network </s>
<s> a printer can be connected to the switch and be shared across the entire local area network through it </s>
<s> to do so you would need a print server built in to the printer or external that had a jack similar to those used in the switch </s>
<s> you can also share the printer as bob mentioned by connecting it physically to one pc and allowing another to access it </s>
<s> the advantage is this is simple to set up and configure </s>
<s> the disadvantage is that the pc hosting the printer must also be on to use it remotely </s>
<s> a printer on a print server can be used by any pc on the network without having the computer hosting it to be turned on first </s>
<s> if you tell which you desire to use that would get a better answer as to how to make it work </s>
