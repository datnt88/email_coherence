<s> so i m looking to upgrade my ram in my hp a6157c </s>
<s> i m running vista 32 i ve learned that means that i can t have more than 3 gb ram </s>
<s> right now i have 2x 1gb pc2 5300 ddr2 ram and i m obsessed with having the best i can possibly have </s>
<s> my question is do i have to buy 2gb more of ram so that it s paired up </s>
<s> meaning do i have to have 4gb of ram in the computer even though i m only using 3gb of it </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> while you can use the 3gb switch to tell xp or vista to let applications use more than 2gb ram the brutal truth is there is so little payback that i d not do this </s>
<s> and yes you get to in most machines buy a pair of 2gb sticks and live with 2 9 to 3 5gb being reported or usable with the windows you have </s>
<s> i wouldn t </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the input bob so i really won t see much of a difference if i upgrade huh </s>
<s> yes i tried bioshock on 2gb and it ran fine </s>
<s> i m thinking this is one of the piggiest games yet </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you dont have to buy a 2nd 2gb if youllonly be running 3 as thats as much as the 32bit os recognizes </s>
<s> there are windows boot commands i believe as maxmem you can use to manage ram size but truthfully you dont need more then 2 gb </s>
<s> your just bored looking for something to spend money on </s>
<s> dont get more ram unless your desktop is a workstation heavy on photoshop or 3d design in which case youll probably want to upgrade your proc or gpu first </s>
