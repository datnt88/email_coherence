<s> here on cnet vista advisor hope this helps jonah </s>
<s> pc pro s review says this about that card quot verdict poor performer but worth a look if building a media centre the 7300 le is the latest addition to nvidia s entry level range </s>
<s> as it s essentially an under clocked 7300 gs its performance is too poor to recommend it as a gaming card </s>
<s> with its 450mhz core clock and 256mb of 333mhz memory we saw unplayable frame rates even at 1 024 x 768 in both test games 15fps in call of duty 2 and 13fps in far cry and it isn t exactly overflowing with features either quot thus that isn t high end </s>
<s> now if you put a nvidia geforce 8800 gtx that costs about 600 into it that would be high end and really high end is if you use sli on two of those cards </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> thanks but i ve only built the computer online i don t own it yet </s>
<s> first find a better more underground website to pick up a strong computer like or something local </s>
<s> next get an intel dual core </s>
<s> am2 can suck a fat chode when it comes to heat and power then noise and power the list goes on into repair last if you get sli you should start with a decent video card like the 7600gt </s>
<s> read on it </s>
<s> it is the best for the money </s>
<s> then you can buy another when they get even cheaper </s>
<s> do it oh yea magicmicro com </s>
<s> check your sound card vs video card compatibilities if you visit creative labs you might find you ve got a lucky combo jonah s advice sounds good to me it s nice to hear see the proof for yourself b4 jumping in the deep end </s>
<s> maybe you re confident about online purchase it certainly cuts out the middleman </s>
<s> if you re going gaming there s always going to be some formats that are out of bounds depending how much warranty u ve left </s>
<s> if you purchase a high wattage psu it will run cooler if it does not draw its max on the wattage side i m not a gamer but have read some of their suggestions and 600 watts seems the minimum the vista home premium i personally consider the xp professional a better os as a fast os but who knows where xp is going </s>
<s> i might consider a business version of vista but check w microsoft on gaming dual layer dvd burner do you do digital photography </s>
<s> plus you ll need a dl dvd home player for the television set you might want to do away w dl for standard dvd combo as far as the rest of your list your really just going to have to build the darn thing and find out for yourself that s why i chose intel products for my first pc build even intel declares a pc build risky i would come up w a second system for gaming 750 watts psu 120 gb system drive no partition ram for gaming don t know but kingston makes a hyper x ram gaming ram xp professional os run a single dvd combo drive my toshiba dvd combo is a quot screamer quot check on the sata over ata hd the differance is really the cable it eliminates the interferance between other hardware inside the tower the flat data cable is a emitter of frequencies and sata allows for multiple hdd s inside the tower i know nothing about video cards but have read that they can damage equipment because they are output devices and the configuration problems i have encountered in my pc projects often have settings going out of configuration since i m not gaming i only need to make an adjustment no damage what s the new vista going to do too your video card settings </s>
<s> do settings chageing ruin the machine or external devices </s>
<s> i would also suggest a metal tower all metal none of that plastic stuff i ve seen tower prices like 40 00 i d get metal for gaming it took me one month to research my first pc build i actually had to purchase a cheapo dell to complete my research i built it in about one hour but it was another month before i signed on to my desktop there are odds ends here intel products might save you some grief but intel guarentees nothing and suggests you only buy boxed products intel boxed what ever it needs research and lots of notes </s>
