<s> i am interested in upgrading a dell 400sc computer that currently runs a celeron 2 4ghz with 512mb of ram </s>
<s> i already have 2gb of ram for the upgrade and am thinking of buying an intel 3 0ghz prescot 800mhz 478 pin </s>
<s> my question concerns compatibility </s>
<s> from everything i read the 400sc uses an 800fsb motherboard with a 478 pin processor socket </s>
<s> so the prescot would work </s>
<s> also what do i have to do with regards to a heat sink or fan </s>
<s> any ideas would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> checked either </s>
<s> dell s tech support is staffed by a bunch of idiots so they were of no help and they system docs have no information on upgrading the prodessor </s>
<s> on the cpu upgrade id scrap the idea as it pertains to that box and look at other options </s>
<s> while you can install another cpu dell pcs are not designed with the idea of user cpu upgrades </s>
<s> cpu options are made at time of purchase they are not like the multitude of motherboard manufacturers who later publish cpu support lists for products manufactured 2 or 3 years ago </s>
<s> while there are any number of socket 478 intel cpus that will go into the socket its really a crap shoot as to which ones would work as youd want them to in your system there are issues in a number of areas bios thermal voltage power supply etc etc </s>
<s> if youve got money and time to burn go for it </s>
<s> if you have a low threshold for pain and frustration you d be far better off looking at other options to increase performance </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> install and run the intel processor id utility it will tell you if you what flavor celeron you have </s>
<s> your motherboard will run the 800 mhz but you need to see if it will support prescott celeron d is a prescott and if it will handle hyperthreading technology </s>
<s> you also want to make sure that your psu has enough juice to run the p4 prescott as it takes nearly 100w whereas the celeron eats only 75w </s>
<s> hope this is some help </s>
<s> c j </s>
<s> i s really important to review the specs of the system via the manual or support website for latest </s>
<s> you know the 478 scoket info and fsb but there is a limit </s>
<s> it may install the 3 0cpu but if no greater fsb selection it may stop at 2 4 it could support the 533 side but not the 800level </s>
<s> one way to verify is to check dell s upgrade offering that they sell if present you have a definite answer </s>
<s> systems like dell and other oems tend to play it safe not to keep users in the fold but to reduce end user product installs and complaints </s>
<s> so if they offer an upgarde its a sure thing it will work </s>
<s> check thier store to see what s offered </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> hey check this out </s>
<s> says your board will support prescott </s>
<s> read all the faq s </s>
<s> i noticed that it only has a 250w psu </s>
<s> i would definately consider replacing that to at least a 400 watt </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> c j </s>
<s> directly from dell s website what processors does my system support </s>
<s> the poweredge 400sc supports a single processor and been tested validated and manufactured in these configurations intel celeron processor at speeds of 2 0 and 2 4ghz 400mhz front side bus fsb 128kb cache intel pentium 4 northwood processor at the speed of 2 26ghz 533mhz fsb 512kb cache intel pentium 4 northwood processor at speeds of 2 0ghz 2 4ghz 2 8ghz and 3 4ghz 800mhz fsb 512kb cache intel pentium 4 prescott processor at the speed of 3 4ghz 800mhz fsb 512kb and 1mb cache </s>
<s> these processors fit into the intel quot socket n quot 478 pin ziff processor socket so if it supports a prescott at 3 4ghz wouldn t that mean a 3 0ghz processor prescott would work </s>
<s> back in the days of the 80486 computers this stuff was much easier </s>
<s> it stands to reason that if it will handle 3 4ghz 800 fsb it should handle 3 0ghz 800 fsb </s>
<s> i believe the 3 4ghz is the fastest clock speed that it is rated for </s>
<s> bob do you concur </s>
<s> hope this helps c j </s>
<s> got the money the time and plenty of aspirin go for it </s>
<s> it might work and then again it might not </s>
<s> or it might work initially but later become unstable and fail </s>
<s> the thing you cannot tell from the cpu configuration information sited is about the rest of the system configuration esp wattage of the power supplys provided with the units i indicated that previously and it s also been mentioned by others since </s>
<s> systems with higher performance cpus especially the last generation of cpus require more wattage </s>
<s> while the cpu may work initially chances are the system especially an older one may become unstable and ultimately fail </s>
<s> let us know what you decide and how it turns out </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> as your mobo can handle the prescott consider that it would be best to consider a bigger psu if you indeed only have the 250w </s>
<s> also be aware that the p4 prescott runs a bit hotter than the celeron so you might also consider upgrading your hsf </s>
<s> a good copper core hsf would be well worth the small investment </s>
<s> don t forget the thermal grease </s>
<s> as mentioned before it is not optional </s>
<s> this is a pretty good combination </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> c j </s>
<s> don t think the existing system has a hs fan in the current design just a passive hs and plastic ducting to channel the warm air out </s>
<s> maybe a better case fan would be appropriate </s>
<s> getting a new cpu and a beefed up psu he might be better off getting a new pc or taking all the usable parts and moving them to a generic box with an even better cpu </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> forgot about the passive hs </s>
<s> adding a better case fan would surely be easier and less expensive </s>
<s> given that wouldn t it be pretty easy to just replace the cpu and then up the psu for added stability </s>
<s> or do you think the stock psu would suffice </s>
<s> c j </s>
<s> but when you start adding it all up it might be better off putting that money toward a new rig with a cpu of choice vice the only ones that ll work in an older mb </s>
<s> probably have to update the bios too </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> no doubt that there are lots better out today and that 478 is getting harder to come across </s>
<s> i guess it would just depend on how much a person would want to engage in </s>
<s> prices for new have come down a good deal but if a person does not want the task of replacing software and transferring tons of personal data the upgrade may give the older machine a bit more life </s>
<s> either way i hope that the original poster will now be more confident it what ever decision he makes </s>
<s> thanks for your insight </s>
<s> c j </s>
<s> just a shame it isn t more straightforward but dell isn t the box to get if you want to buy now with the idea of upgrading major components like cpus psus and video etc later </s>
<s> can you do it </s>
<s> probably </s>
<s> as it pertains to this upgrade it would just a whole lot cleaner better to know upfront exactly what s involved specifically the cpu and hs and the psu </s>
<s> then at least you d have all the parts and know what to expect </s>
<s> i thought i had seen a mb diagram of the mb showing just a low height small heasink without fan for this system but the links below inidcate the presence of a larger taller hs second link below </s>
<s> not sure what combination of cpu and hs with or without fan might work on this configuration </s>
<s> doubt if a retail cpu with hs and fan would fit under the shroud </s>
<s> he could get an oem cpu and reuse the old hs just not sure if that s efficient enough to dissipate the heat generated by higher wattage cpu </s>
<s> this much guessing makes me nervous </s>
<s> good chatting with you on this </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> for those who don t own one of these this is the quietest box i ve ever owned or built i didn t build this one </s>
<s> the form factor server is not ideal for home theater but i wish i could build a system with this kind of quality and quiet and cool </s>
<s> everyone is into this power thing like it s horsepower if you re not putting a high end video card in your box i have a separate ati low end i don t think power is a problem </s>
<s> check out for processor power requirements and heat </s>
<s> it s a compliation of specs i assume it is accurate </s>
<s> i ve got a celeron 2 26 it has a max core amperage of 73a and a max cover temp of 67c </s>
<s> i am going to make the assumption that dell designed the 400sc shroud fan for the 67c max temp </s>
<s> the p4 3 0 prescott 478 has a max core temp of 69c the 3 2 and 3 4 have a max of 73 2c </s>
<s> the max core amperage of the 3 0 is 78a </s>
<s> the 3 0 might run with the stock cooling shroud fan but it will run hotter </s>
<s> you can t overclock this motherboard and you probably won t come close to the max core amperage very often </s>
<s> the problem is if does run hot you need to add a fan you have to remove the shroud and i if sound is a big deal it will probably be louder than the quiet guy is it </s>
<s> good luck i need to do the same thing soon while there are still 478 s to be had </s>
<s> i m running 35c case 36c cpu </s>
<s> it would be easy to check after installing the 3 0g </s>
