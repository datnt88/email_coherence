<s> i have two pc s one desktop and one laptop they work fine together when they are using the internet but when i go online with my ps3 and the laptop connects the ps3 disconnects i m thinking about the port forwarding feature but i don t know how to use it i connect to the router wired with the ps3 and wirelessly with the laptop so why </s>
<s> i use the netgear wgr614 v6 router updated to the latest firmware </s>
<s> i just can t think of anyway around this other than port forwarding someone help </s>
<s> the router back to factory defaults </s>
<s> then explore the netgear documentation about setting up the ps3 </s>
<s> port forwarding should not be a default setting </s>
<s> i think it has to do with ip address errors is there a way to change and keep the same ip with the computer so i don t get a conflict with logging in with the same account </s>
<s> each device s mac address to a specific ip address </s>
<s> i don t know how linksys does it but look at the configuration setup </s>
<s> my main pc and my web server have their addresses locked in my d link router </s>
<s> it s under dhcp reservations </s>
