<s> i ve been looking around for a good wireless headset incl microphone to use with my computer for playing games </s>
<s> my computer is about 15ft away from me so the extension cable for my current headset is quite annoying </s>
<s> however the only over the ear wireless offerings that i can find are just headphones with no mic </s>
<s> the only bluetooth headsets that i can find are for cell phones and are usually the small in ear type with lower audio quality </s>
<s> i have an x fi audio card and i d be putting it to waste with those tinny in ear cell phone headsets </s>
<s> what i want is a quality wireless headset pref over the ear that i can watch movies play games with mostly but has a microphone for when i need it </s>
<s> does anyone know of any product out there that is like this </s>
<s> the bluetooth route is the way to go </s>
<s> i have southwing </s>
<s> they sound extremely good have a mic </s>
<s> they are the around the neck type very comfortable rechargeable </s>
<s> may be this can serve your purpose imho usd 100 is a rip off </s>
<s> i am an online elementary teacher and i wear a headset all7 hours that is attached to my school s pc at home </s>
<s> your suggestion will make my life easier </s>
<s> i use skype for my lessons with elluminate live </s>
<s> my house vonage panasonic machine is 2 4 will this cause interference </s>
