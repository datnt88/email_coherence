<s> so i had a macbook last gen which didnt upload footage off of my dvx 100a panasonic 3ccd its a high quality camera and with the 512 ram i assumed it wouldnt upload because of the file sizes </s>
<s> i took that one back upon the relese of the new generation macbooks with a gig of ram and i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire </s>
<s> if this doesnt work is there anyway i can get my macbook not pro to upload footage programs drivers </s>
<s> any input would be a great help as i need to upload footage because im going into film school in the fall </s>
<s> its a mini dv cam if thats anydifferent on a mac </s>
<s> should work just fine </s>
<s> 1 computer is powered up mac osx is running </s>

<s> camcorder i recently had a dvx100b connected to my mac </s>
<s> no special drivers required if you are using finalcut i can walk you through that too but it is pretty easy it is all in the set up </s>
<s> it is a great resource </s>
<s> on you dvx100 what format were you shooting in </s>
<s> imovie does not recognize all you need finalcut for the good stuff </s>
<s> the video i imported from the dvx100 to imovie was 4 3 standard def </s>
<s> the inability to import has nothing to do with the apple macintosh hardware you were or are using </s>
<s> the issue is that imovie is a free consumer grade relatively low end video editing application </s>
<s> if you were capturing in 24p or some other high end it was not designed to handle that </s>
<s> you need finalcut i don t know if express will do i ve been using pro in the studio bundle for a bit and it does pretty much everything </s>
<s> i suggest a quick read through of sorry for all the posts hope they help though </s>
<s> the problem is not that imoviehd is a quot free quot program or that the video is in the wrong format or even that final cut express is required </s>
<s> the problem is that the poster has is themselves </s>
<s> quote quot i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire quot unquote this poster apparently has been trying to upload video from his camera by creating a method of his own </s>
<s> i thought usb but this camera does not have usb that i can see and the macbook does not have s video input </s>
<s> the manual covers connecting with an ieee1394 cable but the cable is an optional extra </s>
<s> i think a little more information is needed as to how the poster was attempting to upload video </s>
<s> right now i would say this problem is a picnic p </s>
<s> the problem with the last macbook i had was it said it could not read a camera other then the webcam when i got the new gen a day ago i hadnt tried to upload yet im doing so today in hopes that it works </s>

<s> hopefully you purchased the optional ieee1394 cable for the camera p </s>
<s> hi i just recently purchased a mac pro with firewire as well as a panasonic dvx 100b </s>
<s> the final cut software is not recognizing the camera at all </s>
<s> can you please walk me through what you did in setup </s>
<s> i have the appropriate connectors but am at a loss as to what else to do to use the editing software </s>
<s> are any drivers needed </s>
<s> any help appreciated </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but try this </s>
<s> connect the camera using the not included ieee1494 cable to the firewire port of your mac </s>
<s> note that the cable will have different ends on it small for the camera end and a larger one for the mac end </s>
<s> did you purchase this cable </s>
<s> assuming you have the correct cable and it is connected turn on the camera and set it to play </s>
<s> if nothing happens on the mac launch imovie </s>
<s> yes i know you have fc but this is just a test </s>
<s> imovie should show that a camera is connected and allow you to suck down the video from your very nice camera </s>
<s> if all goes well and the camera is recognized then you have a settings problem in fc </s>
<s> however it imovie does not recognize the camera you may have a problem with the camera </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
