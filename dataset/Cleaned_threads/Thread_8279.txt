<s> my new system i built has a shuttle an35n ultra 400 system board with an amd 2400 processor 2 gig speed </s>
<s> after getting it running i noticed in device manager the processor was shown as amd 1800 with a 1 4 gig processor </s>
<s> after a phone call to the store where i bought it i changed the fsb from 100 mhz to 133 mhz and the listing went to 2400 speed 2 0 gig </s>
<s> now it s showing correctly running like a top </s>
<s> can overclocking be this simple </s>
<s> change the fsb speed </s>
<s> not that i want to experiment but if the fsb speed is increased will the processor speed increase </s>
<s> i do have more options </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> and then you get to fool with voltages and then with the amd 2400 should have been set to quot factory specs quot of multiplier of 15 fsb 133 and voltage 1 65 in the first place though </s>
<s> with the 100 mhz you were underclocking yours </s>
<s> play around with it if you fry it they are pretty cheap </s>
<s> stability and longevity of components is a good reason to not oc but realistically you are likely not going to keep the same system long enough to allow that to make much difference </s>
<s> had a pentium pro 200 that i ran at 266 for three years without problem and a pentium pro 166 that i clocked to 233 that gave up the ghost after about 4 months </s>
<s> thanks interesting site </s>
<s> i left everything at default the only thing i changed was the clock in the bios and the fsb setting </s>
<s> i may try to play around with it later on </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> wayne i have had the 2400 for 15 months now </s>
<s> when i put it together i set the bus at 136 and it runs at 2045 at 137 it goes to 2061 and 138 it runs at 2076 if i go above 138 bus it is not stable need a bigger ps </s>
<s> at the speeds we are talking about performance gain is minimal </s>
<s> if you got to throw away donate to charity </s>
<s> i feel it is more of a quot bragging quot thing </s>
<s> oooooo your 2ghz runs at 2 05ghz wow </s>
<s> i agree completely </s>
<s> if i could overclock it to 3 gig it might be worth it </s>
<s> but it replaced my 1 gig machine </s>
<s> there is a difference </s>
