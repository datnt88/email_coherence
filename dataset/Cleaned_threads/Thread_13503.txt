<s> i have a new hp laptop 6633us and it works great </s>
<s> but my modem seems to be shot </s>
<s> sigh </s>
<s> sbc yahoo wants 80 for the 2wire and 50 bucks for the regular modem </s>
<s> they refuse to give me a new one since my warranty was only for one year </s>
<s> are there any cheap places to get a dsl modem </s>
<s> i see on ebay says that it does not have a cable or phone port </s>
<s> just ethernet ports </s>
<s> do i need to get a 2wire that has phone port or do i need to get an additional piece of equipment </s>
<s> the usuals </s>
<s> craigslist freecycle and ebay </s>
<s> as long as it is the same type of dsl modem that at t sbc sells do i have to check the serial number before buying </s>
<s> the at t sbc rep told me to just buy a cheap one from best buy </s>
<s> sorry to ask that </s>
