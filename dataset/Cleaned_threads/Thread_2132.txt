<s> hi can anyone tell me how to connect hotspot shield automatically on startup of windows xp by checking the option to show on startup it starts on the tray but doesn t connect is there a command line or something to do to connect it automatically </s>

<s> quot hotspot shield protects your entire web surfing session securing your connection at both your home internet network public internet networks quot since it s not involved with connection to your hotspot i have to write that you may have to re think and re submit your question </s>

<s> yes i know and agree with you but i just ask how to let hotspot shield connect to any free and available server automatically on startup of the computer without clicking on the button to connect </s>

<s> hi bob i think i understand what samibytn is trying to accomplish </s>
<s> hot spot sheild is a vpn client used to secure your internet traffic </s>
<s> what he would like to have happen is for the hotspot sheild vpn client to connect automatically upon system startup </s>
<s> i would assume that he she already has an active internet connection and would just like to establish a connection to the vpn </s>
<s> samibytn let me know if this is what you meant as i am also seeking a solution to this issue </s>
<s> regards </s>
<s> but it does not manage the wifi connection which is done with other tools </s>
<s> they have it running but it seems they are confused on how to get xp to find and connect to available wifi </s>

<s> hi samibytn did you say you got hotspot shield to connect at startup </s>
