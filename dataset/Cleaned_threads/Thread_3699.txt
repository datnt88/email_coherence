<s> hello i read the cnet com review on this hard drive and it seems a good choice for my daughter to take to college </s>
<s> she ll be using an apple macbook pro with snow leopard but will sometimes be on a windows platform while at the library </s>
<s> my question is related to the optional cables that can be purchased and which are required </s>
<s> their adverts say can be upgraded to firewire 800 well i have a firewire 800 cable that s compatible with her macbook so can it be plugged to the seagate from her macbook and that s all i would need </s>
<s> thanks much </s>
<s> the speed gain is there on the apple but here s the big deal </s>
<s> windows still has proven to be less than happy with firewire connected drives </s>
<s> i won t vet all my answers but here s what i would use </s>
<s> 1 said drive </s>
<s> 2 usb 2 0 3 ntfs for the file system since the new apple osx can read and write to that </s>
<s> be sure that they know to not quot store quot things there </s>
<s> it s not quot storage quot if there is any doubt about that read all the posts in this forum </s>
