<s> i m currently using a d link 802 11g 2 4ghz wireless router to link my modem to my computer system as well as my xbox gaming system to the internet </s>
<s> currently i m not using any wireless features just the 4 wired ports on the back </s>
<s> randomly the router disconnects and reconnects to the internet for no reason </s>
<s> this problem never happened while i was only using the modem </s>
<s> so i m just wondering if anyone has any sujestions </s>
<s> tim </s>
<s> as do some netgear wireless routers </s>
<s> and others of the same brands work fine </s>
<s> first completely disable the wireless side of it if you are not using wireless </s>
<s> that might stabilize it if it is not quot responding quot to stray radio interference from microwave ovens and cordless phones </s>
<s> if it still is unstable you ll have to call d link and see if they ll replace it </s>

<s> why isn t the model number and firmware version of this router in you post </s>
<s> open your browser go to 192 168 0 1 which is the ip address of your router if you haven t done that set up a password if you don t have that check the configuration for the wan settings maybe you are renewing your address when you don t need to </s>
<s> model number di 524 how do i find out what firmware i m using </s>
<s> i m not entirely sure </s>
<s> the version is usually shown on one of the configuration pages </s>
<s> from other sources i understand that the latest firmware version 1 11 released just recently on may 17 resolves the disconnect issue for those who are having it </s>
<s> you can download it from this d link support page and as an object lesson for all this is an example of why bob always reminds us that the firmware version should be checked on brand new routers </s>
<s> even if the router was bought just yesterday it is unlikely that you got one that was manufactured within the last 2 weeks </s>
<s> but the firmware update released just 2 weeks ago is needed to make it work properly </s>
