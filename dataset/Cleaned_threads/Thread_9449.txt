<s> if you don t want to read the full post i made a summary at the bottom </s>
<s> i have 2 hard drives in this sytem </s>
<s> the master is a 20gb drive and the slave is a 180 gb drive that had 2 partitions 1 ntfs and the other fat32 </s>
<s> i was using windows xp pro sp2 just fine i was booting from the 20 gig and using the 180 to store media music video games installers an image of the 20 gig drive backups etc </s>
<s> because the 20 was upgraded from 98se to xp and converted to ntfs it was using 512b clusters and i wanted the 4kb standard for some reason so i decided to reformat and reinstall </s>
<s> after reformatting the 20 gig and doing a clean xp pro install i found that the 180 gig drive registered as an unpartitioned 128 gig drive </s>
<s> i did not format the 180 during installation though i did notice that it registered as unformatted during installation at the point where you choose where to install windows </s>
<s> i popped in knoppix to see if the data was still there </s>
<s> knoppix read the data just fine </s>
<s> how can i make windows recognize my drive </s>
<s> summary was working perfectly </s>
<s> reformated and reinstalled winxp on master slave shows up as unformatted </s>
<s> linux can read slave just fine </s>
<s> how do i make windows detect my drive and data </s>
<s> drives over 127gb get support in sp1 or sp2 </s>
<s> xp won t support this drive </s>
<s> i have sp2 but the problem is that the drive shows as unformatted </s>
<s> sp1 or sp2 was installed </s>
<s> doing so will corrupt the volume </s>
<s> sorry to read about your loss </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had the original xp cd without the service packs </s>
<s> i slipstreamed sp2 into the windows installer then burned it again </s>
<s> after booting from the cd i pushed quot enter quot to do a clean install as opposed to quot r quot for a recovery </s>
<s> at the point where i was to select where to install windows i selected the c drive which had been newly formatted the maxtor utility </s>
<s> the installation showed that i had lots of unpartitioned space on the e drive </s>
<s> i installed windows on the c drive letting windows format the drive </s>
<s> when the install was complete i went to my computer and found a 128 gb drive that was unformmattted </s>
<s> i loaded knoppix which found all of my data just fine </s>
<s> is there a program out there preferably freeware that can recreate the file table i am assuming was deleted </s>
<s> or make windows read the files on the drive </s>
<s> you tripped up the xp installer </s>
<s> xp and especially with sp2 all slipped in would not need such preparation on the hard disk </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t see why this would affect windows not being able to read the untouched hard drive unless the xp installer touched it and didn t tell anyone </s>
<s> btw if it matters i left out a word it should have been quot which had been newly formatted by the maxtor utility quot </s>
<s> how xp s drive table works </s>
<s> one of the lessons you learn is to not use such tools unless required </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you for your help </s>
<s> i m going to buy another hd today and put it in an external housing for backup that does not stay connected to my computer </s>
<s> read these forums as members look for help in how to recover files from external quot backup quot drives </s>
<s> great copy method </s>
<s> backup </s>
<s> doubtful </s>
