<s> this may not be an easy question to answer with the information i can provide but this is the jist of the problem i recently purchased a new motherboard cpu package and put the system together myself </s>
<s> everything appears to be hooked up correctly when i turn on the power all the hardware kicks in and i am given the option to either press delete to go into the bios menu or tab to continue </s>
<s> the issue is that no matter which i press in about 10 25 seconds thereafter the system simply shuts itself off </s>
<s> what bugs me the most about this error is that the timing of the shut downs is inconsistent </s>
<s> sometimes the computer will stay on for 2 minutes other times it will shut down before the monitor can even refresh the image after booting up </s>
<s> is this a hardware or software problem </s>
<s> greetings </s>
<s> sounds like you have an overheating problem </s>
<s> check that the cpu is properly fixed to the heatsink with thermal tape or grease properly applied </s>
<s> check that your fans are all functioning i feel it is most likely to be the cpu overheating as the case fans failing would likely take longer than a couple of minutes for the case to heat to the point of shut off </s>
<s> hope you get it fixed soon cheers stewart </s>
<s> i should also say that a power suppy unit can also have this effect if it is not up to supplying the watts needed </s>
<s> however i imagine you will have researched the size of psu required as you built the rig </s>
<s> cheers stewart </s>
