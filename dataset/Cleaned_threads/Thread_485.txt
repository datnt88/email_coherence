<s> my motherboard is a gigabyte ga 965p ds4 </s>
<s> all information about sata hotswapping is very unclear does this motherboard support sata hotswapping </s>
<s> that is does it have the ability to detect if you connect a external harddrive with sata ii connector to the sata port through an e sata connector at the back of my case that is connected directly to one of the motherboard s sata ports </s>
<s> if i try in linux nothing happens </s>
<s> if i try in windows nothing happens either </s>
<s> and if i disconnect it while in windows it crashes </s>
<s> so i assume that either my linux and windows will need some drivers to support e sata hotswapping or the motherboard just doesn t support it </s>
<s> does anyone know what the deal is and how i can get it to work </s>
<s> i can connect the external hd through usb2 0 of course but sata is much faster i want to play games from this hd and still have the ability to disconnect it from my pc and connect it again without rebooting </s>
<s> technically no </s>
<s> this is done all in drivers </s>
<s> if an owner missed a driver or has an outdated bios that the driver needed then it fails </s>
<s> i have not researched your board but the number of times i encounter a missing driver is nearly 100 of the time </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> back a long time ago it was thought it was when you didn t tell the os you were going to remove a drive </s>
<s> today you see this in the no support zone </s>
<s> for windows you ll have to eject the drive prior to removal </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> can i hot swap a external hard drive using a sata cable </s>
<s> hot swap would need some additional software to pull it off </s>
<s> esata supports hot plug just like usb but is that all you need </s>
<s> if i m not reading minds here please correct me what you think how swap is </s>
