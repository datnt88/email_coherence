<s> i have a 64mb sdram pc100 100mghz on my win98 pc and i tried to replace it with 256mb sdram pc133 168pin </s>
<s> the problem is when i boot up my pc the screen starts to count up to 256mb then the screen becomes filled with coloured squares that are continuously flashing </s>
<s> the brand of memory i purchased was azenram </s>
<s> does anyone know the possible problem and how to solve it </s>
<s> the memory is obviously not compatible with your system </s>
<s> you should check with a company like crucial and put in the specifications of your system so you can get memory that is recommended </s>
<s> not all systems that use 100mhz ram work with 133mhz most will but not all </s>
<s> do try removing and reseating the memory as a final test before returning it </s>
<s> your description is typical of some machines i ve seen with onboard video and a few others </s>
<s> it s a sign the memory stick isn t compatible </s>
<s> just because it plugs in doesn t mean it will work </s>

<s> thanks guys now that i realize the memory i bought is incompatible </s>
<s> does anyone have any advice on how to figure out what type of memory i should buy </s>
<s> doityourself </s>
<s> if its a brand name look up crucial com your post neglected to share make model etc so no one can give a direct answer </s>

<s> the machine is compaq presario 7469 win98 2nd edition os 64mb sdram pc100 100mghz bus clock 100mghz processor 500mghz amd </s>
<s> that machine may need specific memory modules </s>
<s> look to vendors that have selectors that note your machine </s>
