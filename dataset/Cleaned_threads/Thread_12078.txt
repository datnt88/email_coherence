<s> i ll start by saying i m not new to pc s i just don t have any formal training </s>
<s> i have done countless hardware changes to my computers in the past with acceptable results </s>
<s> today however i needed to install a new cd rw and to do this i had to remove the quot bay box quot of my dell </s>
<s> i had to disconnect all of the ide and power supply leads </s>
<s> i have two hd s and two cd drives </s>
<s> once i had the new cd in i connected everything back and started up </s>
<s> no video </s>
<s> i changed a couple of cables around blindly and i got video </s>
<s> but it ask me if i wanted to boot to safe mode </s>
<s> i thought that it may have been because i had to power down because of the no video thing </s>
<s> i booted to safe mode and it atomatically restarted and ask me the same question again </s>
<s> it did this three times before i gave up </s>
<s> now i have tried what i feel is every possible cable combination </s>
<s> i have even tried not connecting cd drives a hard drive and still no solution </s>
<s> right now i do not have video again and i can t figure out what is wrong </s>
<s> so i through myself humbly at your mercy </s>
<s> tell if the video is integrated or a pci card </s>
<s> if a pci card you may have bumped it causing it to become loose </s>
<s> reseat it in the slot to see if that makes a difference </s>
<s> try this one after turning your pc off and disconnecting the supply 220 vt remove your video card and get it in properly </s>
<s> then check all the cable connections and then start up </s>
<s> that s it friend </s>
<s> charidimos </s>
<s> review all aspects of what you did and verify its all ok now look at your old cd drive and make sure your new cd drive is quot jumpered quot the same way its either ma master sl slave or cs cable select </s>
<s> your new drive should have a decal embossed manual docs showing what the jumper ordination is </s>
<s> then check the cabling etc </s>
<s> for all other devices </s>
<s> once done proceed to boot and allow to finish </s>
<s> if it boots into safe mode let it finsish </s>
<s> after its done restart it from os it should then go into regular mode </s>
<s> dell does provide some info details on upgrades check thier suppport website for such on your model </s>
<s> doesn t matter is it isn t a dell upgrade itself any upgrade of your need is explained </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
