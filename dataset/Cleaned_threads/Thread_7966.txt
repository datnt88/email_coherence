<s> hi there i want to wirelessly connect 2 routers together to connect parts in my house large house where the wifi signal is weak from the main wifi device and i need some help on how to set this up </s>
<s> router 1 is the new apple airport extreme 2013 plugged into an adsl modem in the lounge </s>
<s> router 2 is a netgear r6300 and is in the downstairs bedroom </s>
<s> how can i connect these 2 wirelessly to make the downstairs bedroom and other rooms downstairs have a strong connection </s>
<s> i don t want to run a wired connection due to logistics </s>
<s> both routers are 802ac so i presume the 2 routers will have a strong connection between them with 802ac and the beam technology built in </s>
<s> but i need to know how to set up each router to make this possible </s>
<s> and also do i connect to router 2 netgear with a lan cable into my downstairs computer or will that be able to distribute a wireless signal to seperate devices downstairs ie computer ipad iphone </s>
<s> ideally i would like to connect my imac via a cable but also be able to use my iphone and ipad downstairs aswell off of the netgear router via wireless if this is possible </s>
<s> i have been reading a few forums and believe you can bridge routers or set them up as access points but i need some help on the specifics on my set up please </s>
<s> any advice will be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> maybe you could do this if the netgear was on the internet connection since from what i read the apple router can be a repeater that s no bridge </s>
<s> from what you wrote i doubt you want a bridge but may want a repeater </s>
<s> as in all these setup the repeater is placed halfway from the source to the final destination </s>
<s> i ve lost count how many times that they put the repeater in the room that had bad coverage </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> give you some tips unless you re on a tight budget </s>
<s> dafydd </s>
<s> the tip about pulling the wifi back to 802 11g is almost a trade secret </s>
