<s> hello everyone the following link explains how to calculate the maximum throughput on 802 11b summarizing the article it proposes the following equation theoretical maximum throughput packet length 8 1000000 preamble header packet length 28 8 rate sifs preamble header ack 8 rate difs backoff 2 slot i understand almost all of the equations components but i m not sure about it backoff 2 slot i know that this time it is necessary because of the backoff algorithm of csma ca but i don t know why is it necessary the division by 2 does anyone know why the division by 2 is necessary </s>

<s> thank you bob but it doesn t answer my question </s>

<s> since it s not or may not be implemented you may discard it s effect </s>
<s> you may have a bigger goal in mind but between this post and your other post i can t see what you are attempting to figure out that a simple link test couldn t answer </s>
<s> maybe you are trying to figure out what the maximum transfer rate is but given quot reality quot items such as the client or host ack time is variable then i can write that i ve yet to find the mathematical models to match the real world </s>
<s> most of the error is the delay in the acks </s>
