<s> hi i need to ask this question because my back up needs seem to different to the typical long term archive scenario </s>
<s> as a translator i work on documents everyday over a number of days and i also update admin documents to track my work and budget </s>
<s> keeping these files safe is crucial but the fact that they change every day in fact every hour means that solutions like dvd burning are too final and cumbersome </s>
<s> i would be grateful for any suggestions on how to keep files safe that are in constant use </s>
<s> even once or twice a day back up would be acceptable </s>
<s> i currently keep all my non program files on an external hard drive which safeguards against a breakdown of the computer itself </s>
<s> but that doesn t help if the external hdd dies one day </s>
<s> i have considered the mybook mirror but it seems very expensive and i m not certain how recovery would work in the case of failure </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> look at where i m doing a daily or more backup of a project directory using what windows gives me </s>
<s> it s just a right click and to a zip file which i can elect to copy off to usb memory stick other hard disks or other places </s>
<s> i don t bother trying to backup just this or that </s>
<s> i get the whole set and am never held hostage by a proprietary backup program </s>
<s> try simple </s>

<s> thanks </s>
<s> that sounds like it works well enough although the folders that need to be kept backed up come to about 500 mb so some kind of synchronisation software would be needed just to update the back up rather than re copy all the files everyday </s>
<s> i looked and the directory i am backing up is 61mb and the zip file is 21mb </s>
<s> so 500mb at the same may be 170mb </s>
<s> a 2gb memory stick is under 10 bucks here so that s two weeks of daily backups </s>
<s> and no proprietary software used no files ever held hostage </s>
