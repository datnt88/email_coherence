<s> this has probably been asked before but i am wracking my brain looking for an answer </s>
<s> i have a new dell inspiron desktop with the new i3 processor and win7 </s>
<s> i wanted to set up a network with my older dell dimension which has p4 proccessor and winxp and a dell inspiron laptop </s>
<s> neither desktop has wireless cards but the laptop does </s>
<s> i purchased a netgear wireless n 300 router and a netgear n300 wireless usb adapter </s>
<s> both feature the push n connect security feature </s>
<s> i connected the router to the new desktop and the adapter to the older desktop </s>
<s> everything is now connected up and running and the network is secure </s>
<s> the laptop can be connected to the network by typing in a passphrase i created </s>
<s> my question is i was under the impression i needed a wireless adapter for the new desktop </s>
<s> is this true and is it necessary </s>
<s> what will happen if one is not installed </s>
<s> sorry but i am still learning about all this </s>
<s> thanks anyone </s>
<s> it s rather simple </s>
<s> you either need a cable for a wired connection between the dell and the router or a wireless adapter </s>
<s> if you go for a wireless one you can choose between one connected via usb or one connected via the ethernet port </s>
<s> so all in all you ve got three things to choose from </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i kinda figured </s>
<s> i guess i have a wired and wireless connection hooked up </s>
