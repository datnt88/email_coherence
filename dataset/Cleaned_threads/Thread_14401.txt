<s> suddenly i have a mac address showing up as an attached device which is not on my wireless card access list </s>

<s> one friend fretted long and hard and it turned out to be a device on the wire </s>
<s> that cleared everything off the network except me </s>
<s> how did your friend come to decide it was quot a device on the wire quot as opposed to an outside uninvited user </s>
<s> plugged in one ethernet plug at a time and watched the screen </s>
<s> i showed him where the mac number was on one device and he was able to figure it out from there </s>
