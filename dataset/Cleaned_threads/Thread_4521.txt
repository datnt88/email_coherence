<s> hi all i ve looked through several forums and websites about this problem but all of them were more or less out dated </s>
<s> long story short brand new hp slimline desktop win8 has two dvi ports dvi d and dvi i came with dvi i to vga adapter tv is a samung led 1080p </s>
<s> bought about a year and a half ago never any problems </s>
<s> ps3 is hooked up to hdmi port no issues </s>
<s> tv recognizes pc via vga adapter but picture isn t good so i bought a dvi to hdmi cable </s>
<s> while windows is booted i can unplug vga cable adapter and plug in dvi hdmi cable will get a picture on the tv in hd like normal </s>
<s> however if i restart the pc or shut it down then boot while the dvi hdmi is connected and vga is not the tv displays a quot no signal quot message </s>
<s> in the quot source quot options of the tv the hdmi port is shown as recognized </s>
<s> this leads me to think that the pc is for some reason not booting to the dvi d port </s>
<s> if this is the case how do i change this </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> i can t check the manual on the pc to see if there is such an option </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the little quot start up quot guide had images with all the cables adapter combos you can do and dvi hdmi cable was one of the options there </s>
<s> you still need to verify the setup every time as hdmi cycles through it has to acknowledge the setup due to hdcp </s>
<s> it takes a while but you can also recheck that inputs and outputs are good to go </s>
<s> if you re using a different port you need to select that to be used many tvs don t auto set or reconfigure on demand or if there unique situations it all needs extra help </s>
<s> also while adpaters do works often enough they create their own problems or issues </s>
<s> each tv is different as well as whatever quot firmware quot when sold </s>
<s> as for vga pc gt vga if your tv allows better resolution via an int </s>
<s> setting it maybe using 720p when 1080p wasn t selected </s>
<s> all this is open as i stated it varys tv by tv </s>
<s> so samsung model what </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i would check the user manual to see if there are settings in the bios to select which to use for boot </s>
<s> i think it should suffice that without a make model or better yet a link to the product web support site is needed to see if this model has such a setting </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> manuals here though i doubt anything there has details regarding bios </s>
<s> and the tv is a samsung led series 6 6000 6050 bought a few months after leds hit best buy </s>
<s> the dvi hdmi cable is a dynex </s>
<s> regardless i found a quot decent quot solution </s>
<s> willy was correct about the cycling </s>
<s> so basically the only way the pc will recognize the hdmi as a display source is if the vga cable remains plugged in to both tv and pc </s>
<s> this way it will boot to hdmi though a bit late you won t see any windows startup screens the first screen you will see is your login screen </s>
<s> you won t be able to boot to bios </s>
<s> to boot to bios you have to use pc sourse on your tv </s>
<s> the graphics card recognized both displays but considers them as multiple displays so you need to go thru pc source on the tv go to control panel and change your display settings to either clone or single display if you choose single display you need to set the primary display as quot digital television quot hdmi not quot monitor quot vga </s>
