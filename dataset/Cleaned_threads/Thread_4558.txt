<s> i want to get my nephew a tablet for his 13th birthday but do not want to spend 300 00 for one </s>
<s> i know this limits my choice a lot but i think it is the best way to go </s>
<s> i have been looking at the kindle fire nook tablet blackberry playbook and the acer iconia tablet a100 07u08u </s>
<s> this bring me between 200 and 250 which is a good price </s>
<s> it does not need to be an extensive tablet just something he can facebook games and surf the net on </s>
<s> any suggestions would be great i am flexible with the os and am not a hater of other stuff </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it s 199 and if you get lucky amazon has refurbished units once in awhile </s>
<s> frankly i think you should not invest too much on these </s>
<s> yes we have them but we don t use them much </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i would go with either the kindle fire the acer or the lenovo ideapad </s>
<s> however if the 13 year old would like a camera on the tablet then don t get the kindle fire since it has no cameras </s>
<s> i know the lenovo has both a front and rear camera and is the same price as the kindle fire </s>
<s> unless one roots the kindle or the nook i think they only have access to either amazon s or b n quot s app stores </s>
<s> the acer and lenovo have access to the android market </s>
<s> one can also install the kindle and nook readers on these to read their books and such </s>
<s> if not for the rather bad screen quality lenovo ideapad would be my fave for sure as it has excellent specs </s>
