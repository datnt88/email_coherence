<s> is your daughter running windows or possibly a mac </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> i gave up on the la cie for a while but tried again this week </s>
<s> i am still having the same problems </s>
<s> my daughter s computer uses windows xp </s>
<s> i have contacted lacie and tired all their suggestions including downloading an update </s>
<s> however my computer still freezes if the lacie is on at restart </s>
<s> then if i turn it on the computer recognizes the drive but i have been unable to write to it </s>
<s> my husband does not think it is the cable because it worked on our daughter s computer </s>
<s> i ll try plugging into another port but i m not sure we have a front panel port </s>
<s> it worked so well last year on both my computer and one other that i thought it was terrific </s>
<s> i am disppointed and frustrated with the current problems </s>
<s> should i just give up and order another hard drive </s>
<s> quot my computer still freezes if the lacie is on at restart quot if this was my machine i d search for the maker of the motherboard s web site and install their latest motherboard driver package </s>
<s> windows xp does not know or supply drivers for amd based motherboards </s>
<s> they have a basic package but not something i would use too long </s>
<s> at i see usb 2 0 drivers and the motherboard driver packages </s>
<s> microsoft will not fetch or install such for you </s>
