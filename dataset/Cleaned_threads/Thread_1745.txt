<s> hello everyone i have been using my p4 2 4 ghz 512mb ram and 80gb hard disk and a 24 bit sound balaster with 5 1 speaker computer for quite 2 years from now </s>
<s> i have also recently added a wireless router to my existing broadband connection </s>
<s> some times in my house all the electrical applicances except the normal lighting fuse off do u think i should be investing on a ups power supply will it help make my computer s life longer than normal thanks in advance surut </s>
<s> i use a backup ups so that i can finish what i m working on mine lasts for about 45 minutes save my data and shut down normally </s>
<s> however i don t think it has much impact on the overall life of my computer </s>
<s> while a normal shutdown is best any damage that may occur from an instantaneous loss of power would be so slight i doubt it would cause any noticable damage down the road </s>
<s> provided such isn t a common occurrance where you live </s>
<s> now a surge protector capable of handling your pc s load is very important as the 50 product will sacrafice itself to save your 500 computer </s>
<s> that translates to a very good investment </s>
<s> just make sure that the one you get has ethernet and or coaxal protection as a power surge isn t limited to power cords </s>
<s> also make sure that everything connected to your computer physically is also protected by the surge protector as once again electricity isn t picky about how it fries your computer as long as it gets the job done </s>
<s> hope this helps john </s>
<s> the whole purpose of a ups is to give you time or quot auto mode quot shutdown in an orderly fashion </s>
<s> in the process saves your work and maybe some grieve </s>
<s> besides a decent ups look also into surge protectors as well even cheap single ac types do better than nothing besides a strip protector </s>
<s> since you already know you ve some electrical problems it good insurance </s>
<s> spend whatever you can afford but you afford to lose data and or rebuild data etc </s>
<s> back to a point you were </s>
<s> answer that gives you some practical guidelines </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> i m having problems with ups maker and the lifetime insurance they offer </s>
<s> i have a somewhat fried computer from a blackout </s>
<s> i can tell you a 100 150 one will not work as a 40 50 surge protecter </s>
<s> i won t but a cheap ups again it s a waste of money </s>
<s> the reason why is the cheaper ups battery backups do not protect from sine wave problems although rare these can usually occur with a blackout brownout or spike </s>
<s> these can kill a computer chips quick </s>
<s> also cheaper ups is not good for brownout or spikes so if you buy a cheaper ups you are buy a false sense of security and a fight should you get zapped </s>
<s> oh watch the wireless in a thunderstorm lightning can get you if are close enough to a strike </s>
<s> i got zapped so good luck </s>
