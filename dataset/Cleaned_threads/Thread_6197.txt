<s> hi i want to buy a external hard drive but i have 1 question i am buying the external hard drive for the gameplay video s i make </s>
<s> i use a notebook and a notebook doesn t have a big hard drive </s>
<s> so i want to save the movies directly on my external hard drive </s>
<s> for a fast transfer i will buy a external hard drive with usb 3 0 now i want to know if more rpm makes a faster transfer from pc to external hard drive </s>
<s> makes 7200 rpm a faster transfer then 5400 rpm </s>
<s> greetings noobie </s>
<s> i don t think that matters much if at all even with usb 3 may i give you a warning </s>
<s> experience has proven that external hard disks are quite unreliable and error prone </s>
<s> too many members here thought they could be used as storage forgot about a backup a copy on one or two other media and lost everything </s>
<s> so better buy 2 disks and copy to both </s>
<s> three would be even better especially if you keep the third one on a safe place outside of your home or office or where ever those 3 other disks are </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> while there would be some improvement it s not going to rock your world sorta thing </s>
<s> you ll be better off using a desktop and having an int </s>
<s> hd that accessing a 10 000rpm hd </s>
<s> that would be better but again that s a hard major investment </s>
<s> under your circumstances you might be better served having a nas setup not only for work but immediate storage and minor back up </s>
<s> you may want to look into ssd setups as well speed here is greater overall but that s only an idea i ll throw out there </s>
<s> back up should be an important consideration on top of any initial movie storage </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i am thinking you are right kees using usb3 on a notebook the notebook would have to be usb3 compliant speed increase negligible </s>
<s> if however a firewire or esata drive were used there should be an increase in transfer rate but the notebook would have to have the hook ups </s>
