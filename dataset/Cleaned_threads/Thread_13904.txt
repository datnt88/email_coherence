<s> i have been looking into moving my hard drive from my computer to my network </s>
<s> i am also in the market to purchase a new router </s>
<s> i am trying to decide if i should purchase a router with a usb port or a separate storage device for my network </s>
<s> i don t want to spend too much since all the nas devices i have found are at least 200 but i have read bad reviews about accessing data through a routers usb port </s>
<s> thoughts </s>
<s> i find most try this and immediately return the hdd back to the usb or other port on the pc </s>
<s> the reason is that almost every time the drop in speed has the owner fuming </s>

<s> that was my big concern </s>
<s> i was not sure about the reliability of setting up a system like this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i find most nas to be reliable because folk don t move the units around </s>
<s> the most common reliability issue with external drives is that they are dropped </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> is there a brand or specific product that you would recommend </s>
<s> as a nas is all over the map with some offering features that some would demand and others will not it s a shop shop shop till you find the unit that fills the bill </s>
