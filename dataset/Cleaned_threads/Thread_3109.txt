<s> hi my pc worked ok until yesterday </s>
<s> i pressed the sleep button on my wireless kbd and the pc switched down </s>
<s> the tft monitor went into power saving mode no display and just an amber led </s>
<s> problem is when i switch the pc back on i get no display not even a post screen and it switches straight into power saving mode </s>
<s> i connected the tft to my laptop and it works fine great picture etc </s>
<s> this narrowed the prob to my base unit or peripherals in my mind </s>
<s> i have a wireless keyboard and mouse and am running win xp home </s>
<s> have tried pushing buttons on the keyboard and even booting pc without keyboard connected but same thing </s>
<s> any help would be massively appreciated </s>
<s> regards duncan </s>
<s> i tried this </s>
<s> the whole system was shut down all cables removed re attached and then powered up again same fault </s>
<s> i have to use another machine to test the display </s>
<s> i have to use another display to test the machine </s>
<s> you get the idea </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> just put a new mother broad in </s>
<s> when starting up everything works fine but the monitor just keeps going to stand by no matter wot i try it wont work </s>
<s> to my friend s issue </s>
<s> secure tightly all connections that includes the graphic card connector pins etc </s>
<s> the last time it happened was a loose cable not secured tightly </s>
<s> the next possible is the power scheme you ve setup for the system </s>
<s> have you done similar procedure before without any problem </s>
<s> check your bios for the power settings as well </s>
<s> disable sleep mode to wake on lan etc </s>
<s> run as normally power up power down instead of putting it to sleep and work from there </s>
<s> two questions 1 monitor connected to the motherboard or a separate videocard </s>
<s> 2 it goes to stand by </s>
<s> when </s>
<s> do you see the bios post windows starting the windows welcome screen the desktop </s>
<s> kees </s>
