<s> hello i wanted to know how if there are any script which will send an alert once a file has reached a destination over an tcp network </s>
<s> for an example we would think how reliable we need this to be </s>
<s> for a simple affair you could send the notice if the file name and byte count were right </s>
<s> but for most they ll want better </s>
<s> example </s>
<s> 1 create the md5sum on the source file </s>
<s> 2 create the md5sum on the target file </s>
<s> 3 if they match send the alert </s>

<s> hello again thank you for the post </s>
<s> here is my current scenarion file xxx needs to be transferred to another site </s>
<s> in one day there can be like 10k files assume which can be transferred </s>
<s> in this case i do not want to overload the network with md5sum for each file </s>
<s> what i found was to check if the file copy operation was not complete </s>
<s> for e g </s>
<s> if for any reasons file xxx could not be copied to its destination then an alert can be instantly generated </s>
<s> is there any solution to check if a file could not be copied then </s>
<s> i did not detail in detail all the steps and on what machines </s>
<s> that is the md5sum was done on the local file and sent to the remote computer for comparison </s>
<s> it added so little overhead that we don t discuss that </s>
<s> my short answer is just that </s>
<s> the actual implementation can t be written up here </s>
<s> that is it may depend on what oses are on the servers and of course the it or creator s skill set </s>
<s> it would do no good to supply a solution in quot c quot if the person who has to do all this is not there or does not have the same compiler and more </s>
<s> by the way </s>
<s> why isn t a transfer such as ftp being used </s>
<s> it emits a log file </s>
<s> again we have to set the bar on how much work we can allow to be put into this </s>
<s> i ve yet to see a ftp file not get there if the ftp log said it got there </s>
<s> bon </s>
