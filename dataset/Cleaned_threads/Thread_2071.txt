<s> so a couple of days ago i had a post about how i would go about using my external drive on a pc to transfer data i ve been using it on a mac for several years </s>
<s> i was told that formatting it would erase the content so i opted not to do that </s>
<s> however now when i tried to hook it up to the same mac its been used on for years it won t mount at all </s>
<s> instead it makes a weird clicking noise over and over and will not load </s>
<s> does this mean the drive is dead and i ve lost all my data </s>
<s> i have never had a single problem with this drive and just the other day it was working fine </s>
<s> is there no way to recover the data from my external drive at this point </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the do it yourself methods are not assured but save a lot when they work </s>
<s> for example put the hdd in another enclosure </s>
<s> and when all fails you get it to but may i ask where is the backup copy </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks i ll give it a try </s>
<s> do you mean the backup copy of stuff i had on the drive </s>
<s> i was copying everything from a mac to the drive and my other pc computer </s>
<s> so everything is kind of spread out between the three but i didn t finish before this happened </s>
<s> of course i have hard copies cd s of the music files but i ve still got a good amount of stuff on that drive that i didn t get to copy </s>
<s> it appears nothing was lost as you were only copying things around </s>
<s> that s a good decision on your part as some folk try to quot move quot rather than copy and lose stuff during the move </s>
<s> mayne the new external case is the best idea and then a new drive for that case if the drive has failed </s>
<s> bob </s>
