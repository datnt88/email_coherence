<s> hi everyone </s>
<s> i recently decided to reinstall windows </s>
<s> my external hard drives decided to work fine after the reformat </s>
<s> however today i experienced a cmos error after a nasty hard reboot and when i loaded windows again it was very unstable </s>
<s> now my external hard drives aren t detected by windows and load forever when i click them and when i unplug them a message stating that they need to be formatted pops up </s>
<s> when i try to open them it says the parameter is incorrect </s>
<s> also when trying to view them in disk manager the window freezes up not changing until i unplug the device </s>
<s> the strange thing is that they work perfectly fine on my xp laptop </s>
<s> system windows 7 professional x64 evga 790i ultra sli motherboard 1tb western digital mybook external 500gb western digital mybook external thanks </s>
<s> the last ten calls on this found torrent use trojans and troubles stemming from both </s>
<s> i can t explain why folk invite trouble like that </s>
<s> again just sharing what the last ten calls found </s>
<s> it doesn t mean that s what s going on here </s>
<s> what does the machine s maker have to say about the errors </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i built the computer and i have done a virus scan as well </s>
<s> i have not had a single virus in three years p </s>
<s> this might point to defective or slightly detoriated usb cable or ports </s>
<s> i ve had such with an mp3 player </s>
<s> using another usb helped </s>
<s> if necessary buy a pci usb card and see if it works now </s>
