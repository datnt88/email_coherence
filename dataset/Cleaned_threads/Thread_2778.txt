<s> i need to take a hdd out of a hp pavilion machine to use in another machine </s>
<s> i opened the side panel unscrewed the screw </s>
<s> on the other side i can t access the screw coz there s this metal plate that covers the entire side </s>
<s> the motherboard and everthing is attached to it </s>
<s> how do i get the hdd out of that machine </s>
<s> i don t know if this still holds but at one time hp provided directions on their web page to install a new hard drive </s>
<s> you will have to input the model of your pavilion </s>
<s> hope the info that you need is still there </s>
<s> ken </s>
<s> hey i hope this will help i actually did the same thing the other day </s>
<s> 1 remove the power supply 2 unscrew the back screws and the side ones going into the metal panel </s>
<s> 3 flip back the system board and then the side panel should be exposed </s>
<s> i had to install a cd burner the other day in one of these machines </s>
<s> good luck ray </s>
