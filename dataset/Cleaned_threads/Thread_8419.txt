<s> it s time to replace my old sony 200es monitor and i want an lcd in the 17 19 quot size </s>
<s> i m looking for any suggestions as to which ones to lokk towards and which ones to shy away from </s>
<s> i ll probably stay to the lower or middle of the spectrum pricing so any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> mostly used for browsing the web imaging and typical home stuff without much if any gaming </s>
<s> stay at or above the 500 1 contrast ratio </s>
<s> below that i see murky grey instead of black </s>
<s> always take a gander at display units </s>
<s> if they show any defect don t buy that one </s>
<s> i ve seen the ultracheeps with waves on the display the salespeople say that s only on the demo unit </s>
<s> nope don t get too uptight about going beyond 1024x768 on 15 inch and 1280x1024 on 17 inch displays </s>
<s> most find the display text gets too small </s>
<s> even if it is windows has ways to push up the text sizes </s>
<s> gt if you know you can live with a 3 year lifespan your gamble on the warranty </s>
<s> if it offers a 90 day warranty don t consider those </s>
<s> hope this helps bob </s>
<s> are you saying that they generally only last about three years </s>
<s> i just looked at the ads and see that many are tft as apposed to lcd </s>
<s> the ad has at least three or four on sale </s>
<s> i m leaning towards the daewoo 19 quot tft with tv tuner for 379 50rebate 500 1 and a 291mm pixel pitch </s>
<s> if they do supply all the data you should find some number of hours till the display is some 1 2 brightness or mtbf </s>
<s> for simplicity i m using the 3 year number </s>
<s> it s an average of what i see out there </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> as i posted in a later thread i just bought a planar pl1700 17 quot from cdw </s>
<s> i got a special price through my son in law s company but they are lt 300 and have a 3 year 2 day replacement warranty </s>
<s> bob is right about the 3 year life expectancy but my son in law has one that is 4 years old and still going sorry i can t remember what brand though </s>
<s> it s just the form of the lcd thin film transistor to be precise </s>
<s> it s the lcd technology that gives us a near crt bright display though using radically different technology </s>
<s> i would have thought that tft was universal but if there s a choice </s>
<s> go with tft </s>
