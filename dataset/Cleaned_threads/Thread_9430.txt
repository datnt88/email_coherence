<s> i am getting pounded up to 4 times a second with an attempted connection that causes the console message 2 8 10 12 04 27 am </s>
<s> don t know a lot about the airport since it is a mac box </s>
<s> this almost sounds like a bug </s>
<s> a outside machine that would scan ports would normally scan the low number ports looking for a application </s>
<s> the high number ports are generally used for outgoing sessions </s>
<s> now if this was coming from the internet first it would not be sent to your machine unless you have dmz setup </s>
<s> when you are not running dmz the nat entries are setup only when your traffic goes out </s>
<s> this way the traffic coming back knows which machine to talk to since they all appear to come form your router from the view point of the internet </s>
<s> the strange thing is the source address would be the actual address </s>
<s> in this case you are seeing your routers address </s>
<s> this appears as if somehow you are natting the public addresses to your routers private address </s>
<s> although there are limited cases where you would do this it is a very non standard thing to do </s>
<s> i would go back and check your router config and try to make it as simple as possible </s>
<s> routers by default drop traffic like this just because of the way nat works </s>
<s> you really should not have to do anything special to block it </s>
<s> the router will still have drop messages in its log if it logs but that is how it suppose to work </s>
<s> the only other thing i could think of is that someone has gotten into your wireless on the inside and somehow your router is natting inside to inside traffic </s>
<s> again the router should have a log of this </s>
<s> bill thanks for your explanation </s>
<s> it taught me enough that i was able to do a helpful search </s>
<s> mdnsresponder provides bonjour service usnig udp port 53 when that doesn t answer it uses a random port to offer the service </s>
<s> since that application is reading port 53 it is safe to open it </s>
<s> now i ve done that and the message is gone </s>
<s> it didn t stop the messages </s>
<s> it just slowed them to once every 30 seconds or so </s>
