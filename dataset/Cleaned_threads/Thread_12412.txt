<s> i recently got a 802 11g card for my laptop to use when i am traveling </s>
<s> i plugged it into my computer and it detected to network and i was able to connect to it </s>
<s> i was surprised since i did not purchase a router so i m mooching off someone else s network </s>
<s> i live in an apartment in a densely populated area so i guess i shouldn t have been surprised </s>
<s> when looking at the connection properties it says the connection is excellent and running at 11mbps so whoever has the network is using 11b </s>
<s> also under the properties it say the network name is quot default quot </s>
<s> i already use zone alarm for my firewall but was wondering what i should do </s>
<s> i have no idea whose network this is and now stable it will be </s>
<s> is there a way to secure my computer further so the quot owner quot of the network can t see my information </s>
<s> is there a way besides going door to door to find out whose network this is </s>
<s> you can try another rf channel to see if you can make your own network but your discovery is not rare </s>
<s> many laptops have a wifi quot off quot button for such occurances </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i know on the admin area of my wireless router i can see who is connected </s>
<s> i can ban their ip address so they cannot connect through the router </s>
<s> you ll find out if the owner knows what they are doing if you can t connect soon </s>
<s> or they might not care </s>
<s> so can the owner see me only when i m online or is there a history section that shows previous action </s>
<s> but i look at the snmp output when i see the links blink and i don t think they should be </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i m still able to connect </s>
<s> i ve turned of file sharing in windows so i guess there s nothing else i can do to secure my pc </s>
<s> trying to decide if i should cancel my cable modem and mooch off the other person s network </s>
<s> would doing so make me a bad person </s>
<s> at home we don t run the wifi 24x7 </s>
<s> only when needed </s>
<s> i also enabled mac filtering so only my laptop and one other machine can connect </s>
<s> since the setup is wep enabled mac filtered and no sharing besides the printer is done it s about as tight as it gets </s>
<s> when the laptop boots it connects to the last network mine and all is well </s>
<s> if mine is down it would find another linksys </s>
<s> fix that </s>
<s> but clicking the the utility and then the network i want puts me back in my network </s>
<s> i did change rf channels to as far away as the other networks i see </s>
<s> best of luck bob </s>
<s> well if i buy a router and set my own network i ll make sure to follow your suggestions </s>
<s> but for now i think i ll be an evil b stard and mooch </s>
<s> hey i am in the same situation as you </s>
<s> opened up my laptop it picked up a linksys signal and i m online </s>
<s> what can i do to protect my computer and my personal info that i transmit on the web </s>
<s> when responsing please keep in mind that i am not very computer savy </s>
<s> don t use other people s networks </s>
<s> you leak all the sites you visit and if you send email most email is sent quot in the clear quot and easy to log and read </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> has everybody read this </s>
<s> bob this should be posted in huge print at the top of the page next to quot networking and wireless forum quot </s>
<s> this is what i ve been talking about </s>
<s> with wireless you have no idea who is using your network </s>
<s> it uses airwaves and you have no control over who receives that signal </s>
<s> that s why corporations are staying away from wifi </s>
<s> even an encrypted signal is not very secure </s>
<s> now quot dweebe quot as far as your post i will make no bones about it </s>
<s> you asked the question quot i already use zone alarm for my firewall but was wondering what i should do quot </s>
<s> it s simple really </s>
<s> quit using someone else s wireless connection </s>
<s> anyone helping you with any other advice is quot aiding and abetting a felon quot </s>
<s> what you are doing is illegal and i hope they catch your butt and throw it in prison for a while to give you time to think about what you are doing </s>
<s> there are federal laws governing usage of wireless connections and you are violating them </s>
<s> check with the fcc and see how many they have prosecuted already </s>
<s> maybe you ll be next </s>
