<s> my friend has offered to build me a pc if i buy him a motherboard </s>
<s> there are so many choices out there and i m a noob anyway so i would like some suggestions </s>
<s> i need a motherboard that can handle games like age of empires 2 blood bowl team fortress 2 portal 2 and other similar games </s>
<s> i don t think i particularly need a gaming computer but i want something reliable and capable to get me through college </s>
<s> any feedback would be appreciated thanks </s>
<s> for gaming i find that just about any motherboard will do </s>
<s> i like to see the i5 cpu as you surely have read the following </s>
<s> quot our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a 225 lga 1155 core i5 2500k and a 1000 lga 2011 core i7 3960x even when three way graphics card configurations are involved </s>
<s> it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don t hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge based machines </s>
<s> quot with the motherboard and cpu out of the way i like to pick a video card from this list </s>
<s> gt bob </s>
<s> check out asus maximus v its pretty intresting it has couple of different versions at different prices </s>
