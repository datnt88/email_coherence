<s> i did a full restore of my ibm thinkpad laptop </s>
<s> everything went fine with this but when windows boots up my mouse does not work </s>
<s> i have tried plugging in an external mouse but this does not seem to work either </s>
<s> when you first boot up the computer you can got into a program called quot access ibm quot basically a pre installed computer diagnostic program </s>
<s> in this program that mouse works fine however as soon as windows boots up the mouse does not respond to anything can anyone please help </s>
<s> your mouse does not work but you plug in an external mouse and it doesn t work </s>
<s> what kind of mouse does not work </s>
<s> how exactly did you do the full restore </s>
<s> ps 2 mouse usb mouse or both don t work worth a try if you only checked one type kees </s>
<s> the computer is a laptop </s>
<s> the touchpad mouse doesn t work </s>
<s> and when i tried to plug a usb mouse in it lights up but does not work either </s>
<s> its an ibm laptop and ibm has a system program loaded that you can get to before windows opens </s>
<s> i did a full restore from that program </s>
<s> i m thinking this has to be an operating system issue </s>
<s> have you gone to mouse touch pad properties in control panel and looked at the settings </s>
<s> i m well familiar with ibm laptops i ve had 5 and the restoral partition </s>
<s> but i ve never heard of your problem </s>
<s> you might go to the ibm site and input the laptop specs </s>
<s> look for updated drivers </s>
<s> immediately after i mean this shouldn t be an os issue </s>
<s> the next thought is a hardware issue </s>
<s> it will be interesting to see how this is finally solved </s>
<s> keep us posted please </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> the reason i feel like this is an os issue is because the ibm program that i get to before windows opens recognizes my mouse </s>
<s> the mouse works and i go into bios and it shows the mouse as being disabled </s>
<s> weird situation thanks so much for trying to help </s>
<s> should been seen by windows </s>
<s> so if you really mean the bios setup that fits </s>
<s> it s much stranger that another non windows program sees it despite the bios settings </s>
<s> something is wrong here </s>
<s> kees </s>
