<s> i ve bought an lg dp1w with wifi recently </s>
<s> i tried to connect my lacie 1tb harddrive to it but it wouldn t recognise it </s>
<s> the harddrive is in ntfs file system </s>
<s> my friend has a wd harddrive connected to a wd multimedia player and it works perfectly </s>
<s> his harddrive has an ntfs file system as well so this is why i get confused </s>
<s> is it because his mm player and hd have the same manufacturer </s>
<s> i know that you re going to tell me to format it to fat32 but i know that the max file size there is 4gb and this is not a solution for me because i bought it to watch hi def films with it </s>
<s> the situation is not really clear </s>
<s> is it relevant your lg has wifi </s>
<s> how do you connect the drive </s>
<s> does the manual of the lg say they support an ntfs disk </s>
<s> and to experiment does your friends player recognise your drive </s>
<s> does your lg recognize your friends drive </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks for replying </s>
<s> i guess wifi isn t relevant sorry </s>
<s> i connect my drive to the mm player via usb </s>
<s> i think i threw the manunal out </s>
<s> i thought about experimenting and testing that out once i get back i m currently not home </s>
<s> i ll have to wait till sunday evening </s>
<s> i ll post the results then </s>
<s> and thanks again </s>
<s> i ve exactly the same problem </s>
<s> probably it s a combination between the manufacturer of the device and the external hdd </s>
<s> tried to contact lg but haven t got a response yet </s>
<s> keep me posted about your progress </s>
