<s> i just got an acer ferrari laptop and am trying to connect to my home wireless network </s>
<s> i have a netgear router and the ferrari sees the network but when i try to connect to the network it just says quot waiting for network quot i have tried twiddling with all the network s features to try to get it to work does anyone have any advice on how to solve this problem </s>
<s> to quot obtain your ip and dns automatically quot </s>
<s> thanks for replying it is set to get them automatically </s>
<s> i always recommend turning off all encryption mac filtering etc </s>
<s> security settings when trying to get a new wifi network established </s>
<s> get it to work under plain vanilla conditions </s>
<s> perhaps there is something funky about the driver settings that you need to delete and reinstall the wifi card driver on the new laptop </s>
<s> perhaps there is something about the channel </s>
<s> perhaps there is something about and the list could go on </s>
<s> but if mismatched security settings are in the way you ll never know what might be wrong because the router and the card will simply refuse to talk to each other leaving you with no idea why </s>
<s> so turn all that off for now </s>
<s> get the connection established and then put the security back on one step at a time </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> i updated the firmware and got rid of all the security </s>
<s> the laptop then connected no problem and i was then able to reactivate all of the security </s>
<s> thanks for all the help </s>
