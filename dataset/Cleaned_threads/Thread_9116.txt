<s> i have a seagate freeagent go 750gb that my mac won t recognise </s>
<s> i can t afford to lose the contents </s>
<s> the drive was recognised until recently and is still seen by disk utility but won t display a desktop icon to access the contents </s>
<s> i ve run disk utility many times and it won t fix the problem </s>
<s> i ve followed all the steps in the knowledgebase articles </s>
<s> i ve tried to use seagate s diagnostics software but without success </s>
<s> i ve followed all steps in their knowledgebase </s>
<s> can you help </s>
<s> purchased 26 may 2008 s n 5qd375a2 p n 9nk2a6 51 though difficult to read as very small osx 10 5 8 2 16 ghz intel </s>
<s> when you first started to use the drive did you format it with disk utility or did you just plug it in and go about your way </s>
<s> you may want to look at a couple of utility programs </s>
<s> disk warrior would be my first choice </s>
<s> dw will rebuild the indexes on your hard drive and could well get it to mount again </s>
<s> that said i believe it only works on disks that are mac formatted </s>
<s> just checked it only works on quot mac quot disks others to consider are drive genius data rescue iii and file salvage </s>
<s> i gather from the statement quot can t afford to lose the contents quot that you do not have a backup of this data </s>
<s> the drive itself is probably still under warranty but that only covers replacement </s>
<s> seagate will recover the data for you but be prepared to fork out many hundreds of dollars insert currency of choice for the service </s>
<s> let us know about the format thing </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> many thanks for your excellent help </s>
<s> in fact disk utility reports that the volume is mac os extended format so i think i followed the instructions when setting up the disk </s>
<s> this wasn t with disk utility but with the supplied software on the drive </s>
<s> i don t have a backup to the data photos and music mainly so this is a huge problem </s>
<s> from what you say disk warrior may well do the trick </s>
<s> i m loath to part with 99 which is the cost for most of the utilities </s>
<s> i ve found a trial version of file salvage which may allow me to explore the drive it recognises it and salvage the files </s>
<s> the option to remount the drive is i think only available in the paid for version </s>
<s> i ll update this with news of success or otherwise if this is a help to others </s>
<s> in the meanwhile any other suggestions will be gratefully received </s>
<s> and most of the other utilities are around that price however they are usually worth it </s>
<s> good luck with file salvage i think you ll find that it will give you a list of files that it can recover and then sit there waiting for you to cough up the cash for a paid for version to do it with </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> yes i m also expecting that </s>
<s> hopefully seagate will come up with a solution as i am sure that i am not the only one that has experienced this </s>
<s> interestingly i ve an older and smaller lacie drive attached that has never caused any problems </s>
<s> if i can recover the files from the seagate drive i m tempted to dump it and return to the lacie stable </s>
<s> it s also a shame that mac s disk utility doesn t really do the job that it should in my case at least </s>
<s> it should fix this problem and not report that all is well when i run the first aid option </s>
<s> i guess that s why disk warrior and others are in the game </s>
<s> let us know how you get on p </s>
<s> well i received a very superficial response after much prodding from seagate </s>
<s> it wasn t helpful no real answer and just wanting me to purchase their data recovery service </s>
<s> i asked a few questions back but only received one sentence replies </s>
<s> they clearly aren t interested and i certainly won t be buying any of their products again </s>
