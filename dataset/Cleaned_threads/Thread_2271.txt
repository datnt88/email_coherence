<s> i was in the process of changing my power supply when the bulb in the lamp i was using exploded in front of the open case </s>
<s> after cleaning up the mess i continued with the installation </s>
<s> i pushed the power button and the pc wouldn t come on </s>
<s> so i took the new one out and put the old one back in same result no power </s>
<s> the green led light comes on but when i push power it goes out then comes back on but nothing turns on </s>
<s> could the bulb exploding have damaged my motherboard </s>
<s> hp 6620f e5200 cpu ipibl bl motherboard replacing bestec 250w psu with antec 500w psu and upgrading to 9500gt video card </s>
<s> you have to wonder why the bulb quot blew up quot and take it from there </s>
<s> don t take it for granted things should fall into place bulbs just don t normally blow </s>
<s> i suggest return the pc back to the way it was and see if it works at all </s>
<s> if it does then restart the install one item at a time </s>
<s> check all connections and setting cabling etc </s>
<s> and proceed </s>
<s> if it still doesn t work then rebuild the pc elsewhere away from that ac outlet for now </s>
<s> reverify nothing remains of the bulb inside the pc to be safe </s>
<s> if the new psu has a 115 230 sw be sure its in the proper selection </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> did a thorough cleaning </s>
<s> found one small piece of glass </s>
<s> started over </s>
<s> pc powered up </s>
<s> finished my upgrade </s>
<s> thanks for the advice </s>
<s> i put a 95w bulb in a lamp that 75w is the max </s>
<s> never had anything like that happen before </s>
<s> the lamp was made in china </s>
<s> glad everything fell into place and all is working </s>
<s> your reply is enough of a reward to know another pc is up and running </s>
<s> adios willy </s>
<s> interesting </s>
<s> glass is an insulator but it does have a property all materials do called permitivity that could impact the capacitance of very closley spaced pcb tracks at high frequencies </s>
<s> modern mbs are astounding and really do push the limits of pcb design a can see how a minor thing like this might impact the system s behaviour but this is still a bit surprising </s>
