<s> hi colleagues i just procured and installed nanostation m5 wireless ap but noticed that introducing this device into my network lan brings it down thereby denying users of internet services </s>
<s> could there be a compatibility problem here </s>
<s> please help me out </s>
<s> since it doesn t work and they don t offer support return it for something else </s>
<s> i use routers as waps but a wireless wap is usually best if from the same maker of your router </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> many thanks for your response </s>
