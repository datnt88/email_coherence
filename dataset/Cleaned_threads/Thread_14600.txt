<s> hey does anybody know why my new epower psu is making a wierd clicking noise </s>
<s> heres the link </s>
<s> visiting the website you offered a poster there made the point it has loud operating fan maybe too noisy </s>
<s> if that s the case the cause is the fan </s>
<s> it can be unbalanced or simply too cheap of a fan installed </s>
<s> however smaller fans will be loud if they operate in high rpms </s>
<s> better quality fans even if high rpms are quieter and made from metal generally are noiseless if one can even find one nowadays </s>
<s> or the clicking noise is a poor component starting to breakdown but hasn t failed yet or even a dusty fan </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> yeah the clicking noise sounds very electrical </s>
<s> what do you think i should do </s>
<s> it s brand new </s>
<s> and it started doing the clicking noise about 5 minutes after i started the computer up </s>
<s> take a can of air or air hose and with no ac power applied simply whirl the fan with the air </s>
<s> if it makes the noise then you have a bad fan </s>
<s> if you recently got this new then see what the warranty issues are return it </s>
<s> etc however if the that poster is correct then i suspect that brand psu model may have noisy fans and even the replacement one is going to be noisy </s>
<s> so consider yet another in its place providing you get credit etc and buy a better psu or just another brand of similar rating </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> ok thanx </s>
