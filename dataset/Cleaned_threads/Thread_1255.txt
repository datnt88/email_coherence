<s> i ve been through ati s support site 100 times over and have wasted 5 hours trying to get it to work </s>
<s> i ve tired old drivers new drivers weird combos ect </s>
<s> i got the latest directx motherboard bois windows updates </s>
<s> i found no less than 5 aiw cards </s>
<s> that s not going to narrow down the issue and the statement quot the following deivces will not install properly quot doesn t spark the neurons either </s>
