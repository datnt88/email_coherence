<s> i just purchased a wd 120 gig usb hard drive </s>
<s> the file system is fat 32 now but i am not sure if i should convert it to ntfs </s>
<s> i plan on installing a complete backup of my desk top computer and my laptop which are both running xp home </s>
<s> if i leave it fat 32 will this be possible </s>
<s> is it possible to partition it and have some ntfs and some fat32 </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i ve been using ntfs since about 1990 i won t be going back hope this helps </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> why bob </s>
<s> i m not sure i understand the reasons </s>
<s> isn t fat32 a bit quicker </s>
<s> i have ntfs on my laptop and use fat32 on my desktop </s>
<s> both amd processors about the same clock speed and memory and my desktop is a lot faster </s>
<s> i keep em both clean and run the least resources possible </s>
<s> i use ntfs on my storage drives because they are large </s>
<s> they are on my desktop and they seem slower also </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> as drive sizes grew the fat32 cluster size grew to many hundred kilobytes </s>
<s> on the same size drive the cluster is abotu 4 kb </s>
<s> the ntfs wins in this case </s>
<s> you may be thinking of something about 5 years old </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but you can change your cluster sizes </s>
<s> is it better to have a smaller or larger cluster size </s>
<s> i just looked in partition magic </s>
<s> in fat32 i can adjust to 2k 32k </s>
<s> in ntfs i can adjust to 512b to 64k </s>
<s> so did i just answer my own question </s>
<s> is 64k better </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> one of the lessons learned is if we don t use the native microsoft tools such drives do tend to vanish </s>
<s> be sure to keep those backups current </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that does not answer my question </s>
<s> fat 32 default is 16k and ntfs default is 4k </s>
<s> which is quicker </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> here s a table about it gt it doesn t show what happens at 64gb 128gb and so on </s>
<s> that 32k cluster doubles at each size so you can get 128kb clusters in no time at all </s>
<s> it s why fat32 users keep the partitions small </s>
<s> but here s the killer item gt fat32 partitions can t create a file larger than 4 gb since the office and i do a lot of video work fat32 is dead </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i can understand why you don t use fat32 at files as large as 4gb </s>
<s> most home users don t have files that large </s>
<s> i have a folder with other folders in it as large as 14gb on both fat32 and ntfs </s>
<s> my xp disk doesn t give me a choice of fat32 with partitions larger than 32gb </s>
<s> does yours </s>
<s> the links you sent still doesn t prove witch is faster </s>
<s> i m not trying to argue a point </s>
<s> just trying to gain knowledge </s>
<s> file systems for small volumes fat16 or fat32 usually provide faster access to files than ntfs because the fat structure is simpler </s>
<s> the fat folder size is smaller for an equal number of files </s>
<s> fat has no controls regulating whether a user can access a file or a folder therefore the system does not have to check permissions for an individual file or whether a specific user has access to the file or folder </s>
<s> this advantage is minimal because windows 2000 still has to determine if the file is read only or whether the file is on a fat or ntfs volume </s>
<s> ntfs minimizes the number of disk accesses and time needed to find a file </s>
<s> in addition if a folder is small enough to fit in the mft record ntfs reads the entire folder when it reads its mft record </s>
<s> a fat folder entry contains an index of the file allocation table which identifies the cluster number for the first cluster of the folder </s>
<s> to view a file fat has to search the folder structure </s>
<s> in comparing the speed of operations performed on large folders containing both long and short file names the speed of a fat operation depends on the operation itself and the size of the folder </s>
<s> if fat searches for a file that does not exist it has to search the entire folder an operation that takes longer on a fat structure than on the b tree structure used by ntfs </s>
<s> in mathematical terms the average time to find a file on a fat folder is a function of n 2 where n is the number of files </s>
<s> on an ntfs folder the average time is a function of log n several factors affect the speed with which windows 2000 reads or writes a file fragmentation of the file </s>
<s> if a file is badly fragmented ntfs usually requires fewer disk accesses than fat to find all of the fragments </s>
<s> cluster size </s>
<s> for both file systems the default cluster size depends on the volume size and is always a power of 2 fat16 addresses are 16 bits fat32 addresses are 32 bits and ntfs addresses are 64 bits </s>
<s> the default fat cluster size is based upon the fact that the file allocation table can have at most 65 535 entries so the cluster size is a function of the volume size divided by 65 535 therefore the default cluster size for a fat volume is almost always larger than the default cluster size for an ntfs volume of the same size </s>
<s> the larger cluster size for a fat volume means that there might be less fragmentation in files on a fat volume </s>
<s> location of small files </s>
<s> with ntfs small files are entirely contained within the mft record </s>
<s> the file size that fits in the mft record depends upon the the number of attributes for the file </s>
<s> it s in the forum policies </s>
<s> i have to share my experience on this issue and for me i can t use fat32 </s>
<s> even at home </s>
<s> video editing has pushed that firmly into the realm that fat32 can t be used </s>
<s> not to mention that i ve yet to see my all ntfs setups ever run chkdsk on startup </s>
<s> just for that one feature i win on speed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi i already forgot the technical differences between the two since it was long time ago when i read it </s>
<s> i use ntfs for many years and have no apparent differences than when i used fat32 </s>
<s> i still had some hdd crashes due to mechnical malfunctions and some problems when os or other applications went wrong </s>
<s> i simply don t know what would be the difference if those were fat 32 and my guess is the same </s>
<s> i do however notice some applications not many do require ntfs partition although just a few and i forgot their names </s>
<s> in short my suggestion is to make your life easier and simpler by using just one partition whichever is fat32 or ntfs </s>
<s> it is my understand that you could convert fat32 to ntfs but not vice versa but could be wrong so i d choose ntfs plus all technical benefits bla bla bla as the default partition </s>
<s> hi is it because of the partition </s>
<s> i too like you have similar configurations for one of my desktop and notebook but both use ntfs </s>
<s> and i always perform maintenance at the same time such as update os scan for virus and so on </s>
<s> for some unknown reasons the desktop is always faster than the notebook </s>
<s> not only can you partition your new drive but i recommend that you do partition it </s>
<s> you may make some partitions ntfs and others fat32 </s>
<s> if you are using something like symantec s ghost to make images of your other machines then i would suggest a fat32 partition for each machine </s>
<s> remember that if a system fails and this is an external drive you will need some way of booting the system with access to this external drive </s>
<s> you will also need the software to restore the original drive </s>
<s> when partitioning the new drive using gdisk also from symantec is much more friendly than fdisk </s>
<s> skip the rotational speed of the two drives might account for all of your speed differences </s>
<s> just for curiosities sake what are the rotational speeds of your two drives </s>
<s> henry </s>
<s> it is possible but not practical </s>
<s> convert averything to ntfs </s>
<s> 160 gb hard drive go ntfs better mft allocation easier on defrag less flake factor on the drive </s>
<s> can partition for ntfs and fat32 just watch out for ntfs encryption if swapping back to fat32 you lose those files </s>
<s> linux can handle both types </s>
<s> in short ntfs avoids a lot of problems inherent with fat32 to quote someone else quot i haven t looked back quot either </s>
<s> while i am not sure i understood every word thanks for the explaination </s>
<s> the fat32 versus ntfs topic has confused me since i first knew there was some kind of difference </s>
<s> jane </s>
<s> to answer you question about cluster sizes technically it is a performance vs disk space issue </s>
<s> files on any file system are placed into clusters </s>
<s> if a file is larger than the cluster it must put the rest of the data into another cluster </s>
<s> however if the file is smaller than the size of the cluster the remaining space inside the cluster is wasted </s>
<s> this is called slack </s>
<s> take these examples 16k cluster size file is 30k in size </s>
<s> this would take 2 clusters and leave 2k of slack </s>
<s> file is 1k in size cookies for example </s>
<s> this would take 1 cluster but have 15k of slack </s>
<s> 32k cluster size file is 30k in size </s>
<s> this would take only 1 cluster and leave 2k of slack </s>
<s> file is 1k in size </s>
<s> this would take only 1 cluster but have 31k of slack </s>
<s> 64k cluster size file is 30k in size </s>
<s> this would take only 1 cluster and leave 34k of slack </s>
<s> file is 1k in size </s>
<s> this would take only 1 cluster but have 63k of slack </s>
<s> in conclusion the larger the cluster size the fewer the number of clusters there are </s>
<s> therefore the performance is faster </s>
<s> however as you can see the larger the cluster size the greater the loss of space available because only one file is allowed to occupy a single cluster at a time </s>
<s> i hope this answers your question </s>
<s> ouch </s>
<s> my answer is yes </s>
<s> what i like to do is create with an old dos boot diskette a 2gb fat 16 xp will not do that </s>
<s> then install a bare minimum xp </s>
<s> bare minimum </s>
<s> activate it </s>
<s> no service packs no nothing else </s>
<s> i don t even do video drivers </s>
<s> then format all of the drive less the 2gb partation ntfs </s>
<s> install xp lt again gt on that partation </s>
<s> add all drivers updates then programs </s>
<s> rational fat 16 32 is dumb and has no security </s>
<s> not good </s>
<s> fat 16 can be read by anything on the planet almost that calls itself an o s </s>
<s> good </s>
<s> so lets say you corrupt your ntfs sys file on your quot real quot xp </s>
<s> prior to windows 2000 you we re pretty seriously hosed </s>
<s> today you can run recovery console </s>
<s> that takes time </s>
<s> so if my ntfs sys goes south and i cannot read my quot real quot xp i go back to the xp forced onto fat16 and boot that </s>
<s> that ntfs sys is fine since the fat table is never touched i can then copy paste a clean ntfs sys file over the corrupted one faster than you can finish loading the recovery console </s>
<s> the other side of the coin of fat xx is while it has no security at all it has almost zero overhead </s>
<s> so on my systems it lies there like rip van winkle </s>
<s> i wake it up if i need it </s>
<s> this has been my game plan since nt 3 i don t know what i will do when longhorn is a real product </s>
<s> ask me then </s>
<s> windows xp ntfs partitioned hard drive s sensible human intervention </s>
<s> simple </s>
<s> it ain t rocket science </s>
<s> ntfs has several advantages but since this is a usb drive and has the potential of being carried to another computer i would use fat32 to be sure the other computer could read it </s>
<s> wile fat 32 may be faster ntfs is a lot cleaner </s>
<s> think of it this way </s>
<s> on your desk right now you may have several notes books disk s or whatever spread around </s>
<s> you may know the exact location of each item as you use them quite often </s>
<s> it s fast for you to locate </s>
<s> however you may also have everything quite organized in a complex filing system </s>
<s> you know where everything is stored but you have to go through several channels to locate the item you are looking for </s>
<s> ntfs is just that it has the ability of compressing larger files to a much smaller space in doing so can make the search for the items slower </s>
<s> the head on your hard drive moves back forth in a much tighter motion wile on fat 32 it moves in a more free motion </s>
<s> i prefer ntfs simply because i like having the extra disk space </s>
<s> my 80 gig hard drive is now 2 years old stuffed with all sorts of programs somewhere along the lines of 75 not to mention 2000 or so mp3 s my entire gaming collection </s>
<s> this totals to 29 3 gb leaves me with approx </s>
<s> 35 extra gigs of storage </s>
<s> consider all your programs files before you choose the format thats right for you ask yourself is your hard drive big enough to handle fat 32 </s>
<s> bigger hard drive longer search or is it fast enough for ntfs </s>
<s> smaller hard drive shorter search </s>
<s> i hope this helps you to understand in some way how the filing systems work what they are designed to do </s>
<s> sincearly clayton sc </s>
<s> meself my winxp came with fat32 several years ago and i have not elected to change to ntfs </s>
<s> mainly because my grandkids and myself do a lot of gaming on my winxp and the high tech gaming experts suggest staying with fat32 </s>
<s> here is what they say quot windows xp supports fat32 and ntfs nt file system but choose these carefully </s>
<s> ntfs is a more powerful file system that can support huge drive sizes with encryption and compression but it s intended for business users who need to limit access on a drive based on user accounts and who employ advanced network features like active directory </s>
<s> there are no notable disk speed advantages of ntfs over fat32 so if you re gaming on a home pc stick with fat32 quot have never had a problem with fat32 </s>
<s> you should use ntfs </s>
<s> fat32 is wide open to everyone security wise </s>
<s> ntfs allows for permissions to be set on all files and folders </s>
<s> i hope this helps your decisiion </s>
<s> peace of mind is all that matters jack </s>
<s> first understand joeenel that there is no right answer for your question and your question is both very appropriate and very common </s>
<s> if you pressed me for a choice and given your expressed use for the large drive id suggest ntfs </s>
<s> microsoft created ntfs as a more secure more robust file system and you would think it would be a no brainer to make that choice however there are a number of important considerations 1 </s>
<s> hey man get the best a system can offer just use all of them fat fat32 and ntfs create different partitions win partition magic set c system as fat 32 d swap file as fat much faster and e your files as ntfs </s>
<s> by doing this you will have a much more reliable stable and fast system </s>
<s> if something goes wrong and your c renders unreacheable just re install it your data is safe at e good luck </s>
<s> go ntfs hands down </s>
<s> unlike fat32 ntfs can handle file sizes and transfers in excess of 4 gb and has many other advanced storage options that are impossible with ntfs </s>
<s> just bear in mind that any ntfs formatted hard drive will be pretty much incompatible with any operating system other than windows 2000 or higher </s>
<s> the answer to your question depends on how big the partitions are on your existing system that you intend to back up </s>
<s> if there is only one drive letter then you should partition the new drive about 20 larger than that drive </s>
<s> this will allow for expansion with the existing computer s drive capacity as you use it and back up the system in the future </s>
<s> the partition the rest of the drive as you see fit </s>
<s> then you can decide which file format to use on the new partitions either fat32 ntfs or linux just a plug for alternative oss on a dual boot </s>
<s> if there is more that one partition on your existing system then you will need to create similar sized partitions on the new drive </s>
<s> then you will be able to back up the partitions to the new drive and repartition the balance of the drive into whatever sizes that you would like </s>
<s> i found norton ghost very capable to back up to specific partitions and maintain file integrity </s>
<s> the one caveat is that if your existing hard drive is partitioned as fat32 you will need to partition the new drive partitions the same </s>
<s> ntfs will try to change your existing system s file format if it is not ntfs </s>
<s> this could render your system unusable and require a new installation of the os and its associated applications </s>
<s> thank you for that answer </s>
<s> it is understood and makes since to me </s>
<s> now i understand </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> what you say is true </s>
<s> what i just learned is the larger the cluster size the more waste there is on the drive </s>
<s> ntfs starts with a smaller cluster size </s>
<s> 4k so there is less waste </s>
<s> my fat32 started with a larger cluster size 16k </s>
<s> so it is faster but there is more waste </s>
<s> i have another hard drive partitioned in half with 2 ntfs storage partitions same amount of gigs </s>
<s> one is set to 4k and the other is set to 64k cluster size </s>
<s> the one set to 4k is slower but has more space </s>
<s> the one set to 64 is faster but has a lot more wasted space so it is actually smaller </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> my faster speed drive is a 5400rpm 60 gig wetstern digital </s>
<s> now set to 32k cluster size </s>
<s> partitioned with 29 gigs fat32 for xp and 25 gigs for linux </s>
<s> my other hardrive witch is slower </s>
<s> it is a 7200 rpm 80gig japanese brand don t remember witch </s>
<s> it has 2 partitions with ntfs </s>
<s> one set to 4k cluster size and the other set to 64k cluter size </s>
<s> both storage partitions </s>
<s> thats why i m trying to get to the bottom of this it doesn t make since to me </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> i use xp disk or partition magic both will partiton nicely </s>
<s> you can set permissions in xp with both formats </s>
<s> sure you can leave it as fat32 as it is compatiable with all major versions for windows 98 me nt 2000 xp </s>
<s> since ntfs is more secure but compatiable only with windows nt 2000 xp </s>
<s> however you can have some ntfs and some fat32 drives for this purpose you can use powerquest partition magic software </s>
<s> its a user friendly and easy to use tool </s>
<s> you dont need to convert ntfs it is surely possible to partition it and have some ntfs and some fat32 </s>
<s> hi all the fat32 or ntfs can be related to the size of your c drive </s>
<s> if it is under 32gb s just leave it as fat32 </s>
<s> your windoze 98 98se me software o s s will not fdisk anything quot accurately quot over 32gb s so you might as well leave it as fat32 for your win xp home pro </s>
<s> it a a different story if you have a 3rd party partitioner </s>
<s> i like and have partition commander v8 0 i had partition magic but prefer this more after using them both </s>
<s> now if you have a hdd any size and you are running win xp h or p and do not have any partitioning software and want to turn it into an ntfs drive but do not want to reformat your h d then use the win xp s quot built in quot converter </s>
<s> say you just wanted to make your c drive into a ntfs drive from the fat32 that it is now even if you have 10 to 20gb s of data on it </s>
<s> do the following go to start taskbar gt run gt type cmd and hit enter </s>
<s> at the dos window prompt gt type convert c fs ntfs and hit enter </s>
<s> follow the prompts like it might just tell you that it can t convert because something else is using that drive c </s>
<s> do you want to continue </s>
<s> y n </s>
<s> tell winblows y </s>
<s> then it will tell you that it has to dismount the drive first and will convert on your next restart </s>
<s> restart y n tell it y </s>
<s> when it reboots b4 your screen appears it will do a chkdsk and then it will convert your c drive </s>
<s> it took about 3 or 4 mins to do one of my 40gb wd hdd </s>
<s> when your desktop comes back on voila and then there was quot ntfs quot personally i like ntfs better than fat32 i m an ol dos v3 0 guy started with and thus a diehard fat32 fan </s>
<s> it took me a long time but now it has finally convinced me </s>
<s> daav </s>
<s> thanks to all who responded </s>
<s> what a great forum and such a vast amount of knowledge </s>
<s> i ended up going with ntfs backed up both machines prior to installing sp2 installed sp2 and everything is aok </s>
<s> thanks again to all </s>
<s> joeenel </s>
<s> there are many other considerations when talking about overall speed of this or that computer system </s>
<s> serial ata vs parallel for instance </s>
<s> also the main board in your laptop is most assuredly different than your desktop so the size of your memory buffers chipsets type of video card etc </s>
<s> all are speed factors </s>
<s> also you did not mention whether your desktop and laptop have the same amount of ram another factor affecting overall speed of the system </s>
