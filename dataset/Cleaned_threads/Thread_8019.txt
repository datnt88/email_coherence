<s> i have a 6800gs nvidia graphics card and i wanted to know what the best configuration to use with my vizio 32 quot hd lcd tv </s>
<s> i am getting some spots on my tv </s>
<s> i am using the vga cable because the tv does not have a dvi connection </s>
<s> i could use a dvi to a hdmi cable </s>
<s> but i still don t know what setting i should use </s>
<s> when you say you are getting spots are you sure they aren t dead spots </s>
<s> paul </s>
<s> i am sure because they never show up in the same area </s>
<s> sometimes my screen will freeze and i will have to restart my computer </s>
<s> then it works fine </s>
<s> it seems to happen only when i turn my comp off and then turn it back on </s>
<s> when i have it running for a little while it runs fine but i have to turn it on and off twice and let it run for a couple of minutes before i restart </s>
<s> other wise it runs real slow and jumpy </s>
<s> i have a good feeling it has to do with the monitor and video card because i put my old monitor on and it worked fine </s>
<s> i have run virus programs and everything is a ok </s>
