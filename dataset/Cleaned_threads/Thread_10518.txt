<s> hi i have an 06 dell b110 and it came with a god awful integrated graphics card </s>
<s> i wanted to upgrade it no big deal just dissable the old one right </s>
<s> i called into dell and the guy said that a new graphics card could never be installed </s>
<s> that sounded ridiculous to me </s>
<s> does anyone know why my computer would not be upgradable </s>
<s> given i will probably have to upgrade my power supply as well 250wt </s>
<s> what slots on the motherboard would support that new card </s>
<s> there isn t an agp or pci e slot i think based on a little googling i did about that dell model </s>
<s> why would you assume there is such a slot in on entry level system </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> so i can t do anything shy of a new motheroard </s>
<s> how feasable is that as opposed to a new computer thanks for the help </s>
<s> yes though if you get a new motherboard then you have to see what can be transferred over as well as the limits of the case as some cards are known for being rather big </s>
<s> my suggestion would be to consider getting a new computer that can be easily upgraded </s>
<s> regards jb </s>
<s> while you won t be playing bioshock there are still fx5200 and better pci cards </s>
<s> see newegg com bob </s>
<s> ok that was really my question </s>
<s> the guy made it sound like there was no way without buying a new computer </s>
<s> thanks a million </s>
<s> how expensive would a pci card be vs how much better would it be than my integrated </s>
<s> i thought i noted a link where such could be found </s>
<s> is that showing or not </s>
<s> if not please tell us so i can report a forum bug </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my fault i did find the site thanks for the help </s>
