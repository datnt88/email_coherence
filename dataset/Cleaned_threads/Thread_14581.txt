<s> hello i have a home network with router linksys wrtu54g tm </s>
<s> i have moved my home office upstairs and would like to use d link tm g5240 as a wireless bridge that would connect 3 wired computers and 1 wired printer to the network </s>
<s> i have tried configuring the tm g5240 according to the owners manual but the manual is decidedly thin on details </s>
<s> the last thing i did was to give the d link tm g5240 a static ip address on the home network 192 168 </s>
<s> 0 140 and to communicate on the same channel 6 to the home network ssid on the linksys wrtu54g tm ip address 192 168 0 1 using the correct wpa password </s>
<s> when i try to renew the ip address of a wired computer i see activity on both the wireless and port lights on the tm g5240 </s>
<s> the wired computer never gets a good ip address </s>
<s> instead it gets a 169 x x x address </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> but it sounds defective </s>
<s> only the makers can fix that issue </s>
<s> i ve worked around this by manually assigning the ip netmask default gateway and dns entries but sounds defective to me and your choice to live with this </s>

<s> the d link is new out of the box </s>
<s> i would still like to use it as a bridge </s>
<s> maybe someone else will have a different response </s>
<s> i do have a couple of other wireless routers </s>
<s> they might be better candidates for this experiment thanks for your input </s>

<s> remember i can t fix a maker s broken stuff </s>
<s> new out of the box doesn t mean it s fully debugged and works with all other routers </s>
<s> i noted a workaround but if you can t do that and they fail to fix it with firmware or support get your money back </s>
