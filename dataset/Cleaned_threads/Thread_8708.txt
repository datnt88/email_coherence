<s> i bought an asus eee 1000 no h from craigslist a few days ago </s>
<s> when i got it only has 7 48 gb on the c drive and almost all of that is already being used </s>
<s> i took it to a tech he found a partition under disk management and told me that there is 7 more gigs not being used and created an icon for me under quot my computer quot </s>
<s> however moving things over there is not really freeing up much space </s>
<s> i am running windows xp </s>
<s> i have done the disk clean up </s>
<s> nothing where is all this space being used </s>
<s> i mean under add remove programs it s just got the main stuff to run the pc </s>
<s> no extras at all </s>
<s> any advice would help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> well we can t look at your machine so we don t know the answer </s>
<s> all we can do is tell you how to find out 1 delete all but the latest system restore point from the disk cleanup wizard advanced </s>
<s> 2 download treesize free from and start analysing the contents </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> you would have to tell us or post a screenprint at some image hosting site what disk management says exactly </s>
<s> 7 48 gb on the c drive for xp certainly is unworkable and it will become worse with each windows update </s>
<s> so either you have to merge partitions or better replace the drive </s>
<s> you can clone the contents of the current c drive to it so you wouldn t have to lose anything </s>
<s> that your father has the same netbook but with a bigger hard disk only means it s not the same configuration </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> how hard would it be to merge the partitions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> such a merge is not without risk </s>
<s> in your other discussion gparted was noted and i ve used that in the past however once in a while the os won t boot and i ll have to boot the xp cd to fix the boot information </s>
<s> bob </s>
