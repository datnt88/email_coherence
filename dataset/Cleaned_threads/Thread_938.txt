<s> hey i was just wondering if tv tuner cards also work as video cards </s>
<s> and if yes would it be possible to get another card and use it for graphics and use the other one for tv hookup </s>
<s> thanks connor </s>
<s> a tv tuner card cannot act as a graphics card because it isn t one </s>
<s> however there are graphics and tv tuner combo cards such as the ati all in wonder aiw line which combine the two to save space and power </s>
<s> personally i don t like ati and had a bad experience with their aiw line so i go with nvidia s offerings but the choice is yours </s>
<s> for your second question yes you can get two separate cards one tv tuner and one graphics card and use them together provided you have the slots available </s>
<s> pci agp and or pcie </s>
<s> each would have its own respective duties </s>
<s> of course there s still the aiw which can do both and is likely to be found cheaper than purchasing the two cards individually </s>
<s> hope this helps john </s>
<s> hi i cant see a video card in a pci slot so i think my card is integrated </s>
<s> so suppose i go buy another video card how would i turn the other one off </s>
<s> and also what is agp </s>
<s> thanks connor </s>
<s> agp is a channel for connecting graphics cards considered a step up from pci due to the speed </s>
<s> pcie in turn is considered a step above agp </s>
<s> older systems may only have pci slots while newer ones will have either an agp or pci slot for a graphics card </s>
<s> as to turning off the integrated graphics it depends on your system </s>
<s> some will do it automatically some require you to go into your system bios and some cannot be disabled </s>
<s> it all depends on your computer or more specifically your bios and motherboard </s>
<s> for information about accessing your bios click here </s>
<s> hope this helps john </s>
<s> i have detirmined that i do have a avalble pci express slot </s>
<s> i am looking for a pcie video card with pretty good graphics tv out and fairly inexpensive </s>
<s> is this card any good any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks connor </s>
