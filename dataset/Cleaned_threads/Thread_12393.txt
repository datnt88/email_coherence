<s> would anyone happen to have any advice for using speedfan </s>
<s> im trying to figure out what the best setting would be in my case </s>
<s> im using an intel core i5 760 with no overclocking and am wondering what the best settings would be in terms of what my desired temps should be and what my warning temps should be </s>
<s> i am also using a gtx 460 gpu also not overclocked so what would be some good settings for that </s>
<s> and to settings to maintain a quiet but still effective fan speed im using the coolermaster 212 plus heatsink fan combo only one fan shows the rpms fan1 and i can only guess its the cpu cooler </s>
<s> to uninstall this and let the machine work as designed </s>
<s> the temperature goes up the fan speeds up just like it should </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> my fan seemed less noisey before i installed it to be honest and i wasnt always consistantly checking my temps and just enjoying my pc instead speed fan probably wasnt designed for people who dont overclock i am going to assume </s>
