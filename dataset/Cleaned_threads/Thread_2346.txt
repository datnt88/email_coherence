<s> i ll explain my layout i have dsl internet and 2 computers </s>
<s> one computer has 2 network cards the other has one </s>
<s> i have the dsl modem going into one of the network cards on computer a the 2nd card on computer a is hooked up to a 5 port switch </s>
<s> computer b is also hooked up to the switch </s>
<s> before i had broadband i used dialup </s>
<s> this set up worked fine for dial up but for some reason the internet wont work at all if i try to network the 2 computers using this method </s>
<s> please help me </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> to the mix </s>
<s> for as little as 20 you get a device which will service the internet connection as well as provide the infrastructure for a local area network </s>
<s> ics works fine until some software incapatibility wrecks the networking ability of xp </s>
<s> a hardware solution is best </s>
<s> add the router get rid of one of the nics </s>
<s> connect the pcs to the router </s>
<s> done </s>
<s> is the 5 port swith a router also </s>
<s> if is it then you won t have to buy a round and you would disregard the second nic card and connect the dsl directly to the switch and run ur network and share the internet thru that if now then i would suggest buying a rounter to make things simple </s>
<s> you can also set the net on pc a then run the xp network wizard on pc a with internet sharing then run the network wizard on pc b telling it to get net access from pc a </s>
<s> do not foget on to distinguish the nic cards on pc a properly 1 would be for the net and the other for the network with internet sharing enabled </s>
<s> good luck </s>
