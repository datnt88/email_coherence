<s> athlonxp 2500 generic hercules 400w psu 1gb ram 1 dvd rom 1 dvd rw radeon 8500 64mb floppy sb audidy 2 plat with live drive installed xp sp1a all updates ok so i m playing a game of war3 and suddenly the system just seems to lock up </s>
<s> the monitor just goes black and then into power save mode </s>
<s> i smell what smells like popped kettle corn coming from the psu </s>
<s> no other parts seem damaged after visual inspection </s>
<s> including the cpu core </s>
<s> if i turn the system on the fans all start up and the dvd drives flash like they should </s>
<s> the floppy is silent and i get no signal to the monitor including the pre post diag messages </s>
<s> the monitor displays a message about how there s no signal </s>
<s> i ve tried switching video cards monitors reseating the video card making sure the other pci cards were still seated properly nothing works </s>
<s> the only way to turn the system off is via the switch on the power supply </s>
<s> the power and reset buttons don t work </s>
<s> my thinking at this point is that the psu has blown out enough that it s unable to power everything in my system </s>
<s> i know athlonxp s are known for putting high demands on psu s and i suppose i m lucky the potentially dead one lasted as long as it did </s>
<s> but before i run out and spend about 80 on a replacement psu i want to see if others agree with my assessment </s>
<s> i ll supply an article about how to select the size and then another about how they lie about the rated size </s>
<s> in closing we lost about 5 motherboards and a few power supplies due to failing motherboard capacitors </s>
<s> be sure your psu loss isn t due to some other issues </s>
<s> but with what parts you ve listed that psu may have been just too small </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> on a side note after you get your p s problem fixed i hope could you tell me how you like the xp2500 </s>
<s> i m trying to decide between the xp2500 and the xp2600 barton </s>
<s> not sure the xp2600 would be any faster for the extra money </s>
<s> can t find a side by side comparison </s>
<s> good luck on the psu </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> you mention quot generic quot and that what can happen especially on a loaded up system </s>
<s> at least 400w is better than 300w whcih many a home build system case comes supplied with so at least you started out decent </s>
<s> the problem with a blown p s unit is that it could cause other problem s </s>
<s> so don t discount it should after replacing the p s unit flaky problem s may appear </s>
<s> the better p s units are enermax or antec sp or those supplied by pcpowerandcooling dang good </s>
<s> it not surprising that 500w units are now available and even if generic is better than 400w unless name brand </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
