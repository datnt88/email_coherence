<s> i have a new e521 dimension desktop with a 19 quot ultrasharp digital monitor </s>
<s> i upgraded to a geforce 7900gt graphics card </s>
<s> when i play back slide shows made with windows movie maker and or proshow gold i get terrible image quality on any photos that are in motion </s>
<s> i don t see this when my screen saver kicks in and uses the same pictures that are in the slide show </s>
<s> it s hard to explain what it looks like but it s kind of a flickering </s>
<s> any vertical or horizontal lines seem to look the worst but i can see a very digital looking effect on all of the pictures </s>
<s> water looks like is moving along with everything else </s>
<s> any idea what causes this </s>
<s> i ve tried changing resolution cleartype refresh rate and much more that i can t remember </s>
<s> anyone else seeing this </s>
<s> or know a fix </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> when we create content with mm it should degrade the video to what is known as 480p which is ok for tv sets but would look ratty on a pc display </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> does this mean there is no fix to this </s>
<s> i hate to think i paid 150 00 extra for a 19 quot ultra sharp monitor and ended up with terrible slideshow images </s>
<s> what is mm multi media </s>
<s> the output of movie maker is for tvs </s>
<s> specifically bad old ratty ntsc pal tvs with 480p </s>
<s> your pc monitor is well beyond that and why it looks terrible with this old software </s>
<s> i see proshow gold now has hd quality output </s>
