<s> my dell 8300 is a year and a half old but now does not turn on </s>
<s> both the power supply and mother board check out ok now the problem seems to be between the on off button to the mother board </s>
<s> is there a way to check for this or get around it </s>
<s> where would i be able to fine a replacement if needed </s>
<s> i have check ebay can replace the whole case but nothing </s>
<s> dell customer service takes to long and will charge a fee just to tell me that i should send it in </s>
<s> any help will do thanks </s>
<s> quot both the power supply and mother board check out ok quot how did you test them </s>
<s> the power switch is a momentarty push switch </s>
<s> the easest way to check this out is to carefully short out the pins on the mb whet the power button plugs into </s>
<s> if it powers up then the switch is bad </s>
<s> then you can have fun getting a replacement from dell </s>
<s> or juryrig a small switch </s>

<s> ebay has a case and power supply for 50 that i am looking into </s>
<s> have you heard of just removing the battery for a few minutes so the computer can reset </s>
<s> blankster have you ever tried delltalk </s>
<s> they can be pretty helpful and you might find someone who has had the same problem and has a fix </s>
