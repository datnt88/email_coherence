<s> i am not a computer genius but i know some stuff so here is the problem </s>
<s> i do not know if someone is stealing my internet even if it is possible but i prefer to know the facts </s>
<s> here are the details i use verizon dsl high speed internet </s>
<s> this is not wireless internet so don t tell me about securing router and access points yes </s>
<s> i read alot </s>
<s> here is the setup if its necessary </s>
<s> there is a box outside the house with a hard line entering the house </s>
<s> a telephone wire is connected from the hard line jack to a high speed modem which is connected to the computer </s>
<s> someone told me this but i am not sure of its validity so if anyone knows please explain what arp is about </s>
<s> i was told to run a command named quot arp a quot several times and count the number of entries i see </s>
<s> sometimes i get 7 entries and sometimes i get 8 entries </s>
<s> does the extra entry indicate someone else is using the internet </s>
<s> so here are the questions 1 is the dsl type mentioned above stealable </s>
<s> 2 how to know if someone is stealing it </s>
<s> any commands etc 3 how to find the culprit if there is one </s>
<s> 4 what is arp about </s>
<s> and is there any validity to the above or is it just nonsense </s>
<s> please explain thank you people </s>
<s> since all internet connections specifically the modem have an address called the mac address and this address is assigned to your connection and account it s highly unlikely anyone could steal your account </s>
<s> when you connect another modem the only way to get access to the account to a dsl line the host computer sees a discrepancy in the address s and will either stop working or deliver garbage </s>
<s> why do you think this is happening </s>
<s> call verizon and have them test for extra connections </s>
<s> will help to understand arp and what it entails </s>
