<s> hi christine i used to have one of those and the only way i could get it to behave was to delete it entirely assuming of course you still have the install disc if not i would suggest you logon to epson s site and download and burn the relevant drivers to a cd then you can go ahead safely </s>
<s> ps </s>
<s> you may not find the exact drivers you are looking for but i know the 850 ordinary is there </s>
<s> good luck worzlegummage </s>
<s> i went into the preferences and hit quot deep clean quot and it fixed it thank goodness </s>
