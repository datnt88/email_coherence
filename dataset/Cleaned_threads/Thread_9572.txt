<s> tried to boot computer and received a nasty message saying quot boot failure system halted quot </s>
<s> bios no longer recognizes drive c can this drive be used as a slave or is it trashed </s>
<s> i would like to get some pictures out of the picture file </s>
<s> i now am using a 15 gig maxtor drive from an older computer </s>
<s> seems to work ok thanks </s>
<s> connect the failed drive as slave </s>
<s> i d give it a shot </s>
<s> you might be able to recover your pictures then format the drive and it be good again </s>
<s> a lot depends on which os you have and what is wrong with the drive </s>
<s> i have had this happen and i take the drive out and make it a slave in a different pc and run scandisk on it and this has repaired the drive and it will reboot </s>
<s> works on w2k and xp but there is no guarente </s>
<s> even if you can get it working again i would shop around for a new hd </s>
<s> then reinstall the os on the new hd and make the old hd a slave </s>
