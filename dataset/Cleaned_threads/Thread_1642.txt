<s> i have had my hp computer for a while now and have decided it is undoubtedly time to upgrade </s>
<s> i know i can t get much for a price range of strictly 500 700 but can someone help me out </s>
<s> i need to know what is the best computer i can get in terms of hd memory ram video and basically just overall stats </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> a budget of strictly 500 700 </s>
<s> is that just for the computer box or do you want that to include a new keyboard mouse monitor and speakers </s>
<s> are you interested in building it yourself </s>
<s> well i m not exactly computer illiterate but i m not up to the task of building one myself </s>
<s> of course i d love it to come with a mouse keyboard etc but that s just asking too much </s>
<s> i just want the best computer i can get for my price range </s>
<s> if you were happy with your hp go to their site and you can build your own </s>
<s> i had my wife s pc within 6 days of ordering and that was 4 days before they anticipated shipping it </s>
<s> they usually have a rebate and several free upgrades going on </s>
<s> i got her a free hd and cd rw drive upgrade by procrastinating a day or two </s>
<s> well i do like hp but i know theer are some pretty sweet deals on the internet </s>
<s> i ve searched but i m just reluctant to buy from seemingly unknown quot companies quot that s why i m here </s>
<s> i don t need my computer to be brand name i just need it to have what i need </s>
<s> basically my question is and this may depend on different opinions what is the best all around i can get for 700 </s>
<s> thanks foir the suggestions though </s>
<s> buy the components online from newegg com and get a local shop or geek to put it together </s>
<s> yes you ll have to pay them but you ll get the best bang for your buck </s>
<s> in order to determine what the best computer would be for your money we have to know what types of things you do with your computer </s>
<s> are you a gamer or like to edit photos or videos or do you just run home office type apps </s>
<s> a good local system builder could help you determine exactly what your needs are and design a system to meet your needs </s>
<s> i e if you don t need high end graphics and an on board video chip would suffice you could spend the extra money on memory hard drive or faster cpu </s>
<s> spending extra on memory is better than pinching your budget on memory for a faster cpu </s>
<s> just a few thoughts hope this helps </s>
<s> well i m not a gamer but i play a few games like knight of the old republic which thi computer no longer allows me to use </s>
<s> i need memory because i m a frequent downloader although i do take care of my computer </s>
<s> i wouldn t mind a better than average video card but not somehing top of the line </s>
<s> i d also like at least 512 1 gig ram since that seems to be the standard now </s>
<s> someone please help me in choosing a model </s>
<s> i ll answer any other questions if you ll help me i just don t know what to do </s>

<s> thats a hell of a deal u ll want to add a better video card though as most onboard gpu s are junk and maybe a sweet monitor to go with it too </s>
<s> good deal though </s>
<s> oh god sorry i meant 600 bucks </s>
<s> i think it s still a good deal though </s>
<s> i m trying to get the best computer i can because i can just use this monitor </s>

<s> i know i seem to be asking a lot of questions but i really need a good computer so i don t blow all my money on this one and have to buy another in the near future </s>
<s> newegg com simply has the best prices on computer components </s>
<s> here s a video card that s cheaper than the ati and performs better </s>
<s> you will also need a new power supply the standard one doesn t provide enough power for a seperate video card </s>
<s> the first link is the video card the second one is the power supply </s>
<s> a link takes you to another page </s>
<s> to go to that other page click on the link </s>
<s> the link will be blue and when you move your mouse so that the little cursor is on top of the link the link will become underlined </s>
<s> video card power supply wasn t that easy </s>
