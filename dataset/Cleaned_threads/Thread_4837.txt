<s> i am going to network a laptop with xp home and a desktop with xp pro through a router </s>
<s> i plan to buy an external hard drive probably western digital passport to be the central place where all the files are for both machines to access </s>
<s> i also want the laptop and hard drive to be mobile so i can take it out of the office and still access and use my files </s>
<s> what i m trying to figure out is if my laptop with xp home which doesn t have encryption capabilities will be able to open view edit a file from my external drive that does have encryption </s>
<s> also am i right to assume i can network xp home through a router </s>
<s> you didn t tell so all i can tell you is there is no hardware issue here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what info do you need </s>
<s> the encryption is on the western digital external hard drive and it s wd sync with aes </s>
<s> that s all i can find out </s>
<s> i do know there are big issues why windows own encryption would fail </s>
<s> best of luck but in parting there is no known hardware issue here </s>
