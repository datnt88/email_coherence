<s> hello i have to buy a replacement for my hp all in one 7410 because it finally gave out </s>
<s> unfortunately that model is no longer made so i was looking at other brands </s>
<s> i was considering an epson artisan 800 or a brother multifunction </s>
<s> any thoughts </s>
<s> my hp printer is totally wireless and is not hooked into my router and i have multiple pcs and laptops printing to it </s>
<s> my concern is that the brother and the epson must be hooked in to the router which is in another room to make it wireless unlike the hp </s>
<s> can anyone advise me if the other brands are truly wireless or do they have to hook in through the router </s>
<s> thanks so much </s>
<s> you can buy wireless adapters that work with other printers </s>
<s> this broadens your choices considerably </s>
<s> you might want to look into that instead </s>
<s> pick a good printer and add the adapter </s>
<s> they ll generally plug into ethernet or usb ports </s>
<s> and if you already happen to have any nas drives they might also be able to support network printers </s>
<s> the interface is usually usb which widens the range of printers to be bought </s>
