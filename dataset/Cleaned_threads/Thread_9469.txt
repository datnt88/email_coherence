<s> i need help choosing between two great cards made by ati </s>
<s> it is between the x850 and the x1600xt </s>
<s> i have heard that the x1600xt is the way to go but i still need help deciding i am building a computer now with the dfi rdx200 cf dr motherboard 1gb of ddr memory amd 4000 120 gig hard drive used to play games fast </s>
<s> the x850xt is the faster card but lacks sm3 features like hdr </s>
<s> however those features require quite a bit of graphics horsepower and they re of little use on mid range like the x1600xt or low end cards since if you turn on sm3 features frame rates drop so low as to make the game unplayable </s>
<s> here are benchmarks for both therefore i suggest the x850xt over the x1600xt </s>
<s> if you can afford a few dollars more an nvidia 7600gt is a better choice comparable speed to x850xt and sm3 features </s>
<s> the cheapest x850xt is 164 on newegg com </s>
<s> the cheapest 7600gt is 149 on newegg com after a 10 mail in rebate </s>
<s> i know which one i d get </s>
<s> the only problem is tha newegg does not ship to canada </s>
<s> here are links to a radeon x800gto2 199 cad shipping and a geforce 7600gt 230 cad shipping from a canadian web shop </s>
<s> the x800gto2 can be soft modded to an x850xt </s>
<s> it s painless i have one and have done the mod myself </s>
<s> x800gto2 7600gt </s>
<s> if you know anyone who lives in the us of a ask them to purchase it for you </s>
<s> once they receive it ask them to send it to you via ups </s>
<s> if you don t know anyone from the us of a find another website that ships to canada </s>
<s> well i live in the usa and have a saphire x1600xt thats new that i bought from newegg if you want you can buy it </s>
<s> my email is fgamer2005 yahoo com </s>
