<s> hi just purchased an hp 1030nr mini laptop and the cpu fan stays on constantly </s>
<s> i have downloaded all updates from hp support even the bios also all windows updates have been installed </s>
<s> i am just browsing websites and ebay with no intense typing or programs running </s>
<s> this issue drains my battery down very quickly any suggestions will be appreciated </s>
<s> in bios there does not seem to a funcion to alter cpu usage </s>
<s> ask for a fix or your money back </s>
<s> to reduce cpu power when max cpu performance not required or to run the fan 100 of the time versus only when the cpu reaches a minimum temp </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
