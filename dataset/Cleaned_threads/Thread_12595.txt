<s> hi all is there anyone own a hp psc 1610 all in one printer scanner </s>
<s> i v just bought one and to my dissappointment i think the scanning quality is quite bad </s>
<s> attached a scanned sample here img img if cant view the above pic goto check out those straight lines in the attached picture my original drawing is a very clean cut straightline very fine but my scanned result is like this </s>
<s> its the problem with my scanner or setting </s>
<s> any advise comment </s>

<s> bob </s>
<s> tried few times using different dpi up to 600 x 1200 dpi still the same </s>
<s> don t think it comes with money back satisfaction guarantee </s>
<s> i just wanna find out whether all this model have such problem or the prob with my unit only tq </s>
<s> a non performing product can be returned due to non performance </s>
<s> at 600x1200 dpi on screen will be at most 100 dpi so it will be like looking at it at 72x under a microscope </s>
<s> be sure to view onscreen at something reasonable </s>
<s> wish i had your setup to test but armed with only this discussion it s defective and needs to be returned </s>
