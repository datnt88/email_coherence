<s> my daughter left her ipod nano plugged into our emachines running xp all night long </s>
<s> when we rebooted the computer in the morning we get little or no power </s>
<s> the computer seems to start up ok the light turns green then you can hear the power quieten down the light fades to a pale yellow </s>
<s> nothing works from that point on </s>
<s> is this the power supply that has burned out or does someone know what else it could be </s>
<s> if you read the usb spec you can short out the usb 5v lines to any other line without burnout </s>
<s> and at 500ma at 5v that s 2 5 watts </s>
<s> this should not strain any machine s 300 and up watt power supply </s>
<s> i d look eleswhere for the cause such as age etc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i didn t think it was the nano but it was a big coincidence </s>
<s> should i look at replacing the power supply </s>
<s> any other ideas </s>
<s> to see if that s it try one more time and when it s failed use your voltmeter to test the power supply quot legs quot to see if the supply has died on any of the legs </s>
