<s> hey im planning to buy a new pc not spending too much but i want to get the most out of my money </s>
<s> i just need help with choosing the motherboard and im thinking of have a dual channel for the ram because i heard that its pretty good </s>
<s> here s the website that im going to buy it from and here are the components that i ve chosen so far intel core 2 quad q6600 2 4ghz lga775 quad core 386 35 seagate 250gb 7200rpm 8mb cache 3gb s sataii hard drive </s>
<s> you start over </s>
<s> your doing this backwards start with the motherboard and then add from there </s>
<s> choose a mother board with the most universal socket that you can get then make sure it can run the most advanced cpu that is available the day you buy it </s>
<s> motherboard first then cpu then ram and graphics card then all the rest </s>
<s> much of this will depend on your personal needs and wants choose components that fit them </s>
<s> definitely go with a mobo based on the intel p31 or p35 chipset </s>
<s> these mobos will support intel s latest 45nm penryn cpus so you ll have an upgrade path in the near future </s>
<s> the abit ip35 gigabyte ga p35 msi p35 neo2 families of mobos are good choices but from your list gigabyte seems to have the best price and availabilty </s>
<s> i suggest you consider these three gigabyte ga p31 s3l gigabyte ga p35 ds3 gigabyte ga p35 s3l gigabyte s naming suffixes can be confusing so here s a comparison chart </s>
<s> the mobo price goes up as features are added so determine what features you ll use and buy the mobo that delivers </s>
<s> no reason to pay for a 2nd pci express slot 8gb ram support 2 extra sata ports extra overclocking support and 4 extra usb ports if you re not going to use them </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> you re going about your build properly </s>
<s> but if you plan on overclocking you should get a p35 based mobo not p31 and go with better ram cl4 or faster from ocz corsair crucial mushkin etc </s>
<s> wow thanks for your reply guys </s>
<s> what do you mean go by a better ram </s>
<s> as in brand wise or the capacity or what </s>
<s> and i wanted to ask you does it matter if the ram is eec or not eec or dont they have that anymore </s>
<s> so gigabyte is a good mobo </s>
<s> i heard asus makes the best mobos </s>
<s> better ram lower cas latency </s>
<s> your original post mentioned kingston value ram cl 5 i suggest you go with cl 4 ram instead ddr2 800 cl4 can be picked up for 40usd gb so there s no reason to use cl5 unless 5 10 will break your budget </s>
<s> for desktop boards you don t need error correcting memory </s>
<s> asus msi gigabyte and abit are the name brands for mobo using intel chipset </s>
<s> asus is very popular largest oem mfg much like hertz vs avis and budget and thus they can charge a bit more however any of these brands will get you a top notch mobo </s>
<s> hey thanks for your reply </s>
<s> ok can i ask you guys for a big favour </s>
<s> can you help me construct a pc from this site all needed parts would be there and my budget would be inside 1000 </s>
