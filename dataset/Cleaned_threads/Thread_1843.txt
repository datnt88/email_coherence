<s> i really know nothing about the quot mechanics quot of my computer it is about 5 years old and does need updating but still works fast enough for browsing the internet </s>
<s> the other day when i went to turn it on there were sparks and smoke came out of the tower where the fan is on the back </s>
<s> i opened it up to see if i could tell what got fried </s>
<s> i can only tell that the box inside that houses the fan on off switch and where i plug the tower into the wall smells heavily like the smoke </s>
<s> nothing else quot looks quot damaged </s>
<s> is this power box replacable can it be changed out </s>
<s> it seems like it would be faily easy to unscrew it from the tower and put a new one in but my computer is custom built the company that made it is out of buisness now </s>
<s> i just dont know if its worth it to take it to someone for 100 bucks an hour if im going to need a whole new computer anyway </s>
<s> obviously there are things on the hard drive id like to get off and pictures i just wanted some help deciding whats best to do </s>
<s> sounds like the power supply </s>
<s> yes it s replaceable like you surmise and easy </s>
<s> custom built or off the shelf they all have basically the same connections to the system board and drives </s>
<s> pull the supply and take it to a good computer store </s>
<s> reason being so you can match the leads with what is available </s>
<s> they are all generally the same just do this to make sure </s>
<s> a good supply of 300 or more watts is around fifty bucks </s>
<s> my next concern would be that the failure may have caused spikes toward the system board </s>
<s> the only way to test this is to install the new supply and try a boot </s>
<s> if it fails the board is probably toast or a component like the processor memory or one of the drives </s>
<s> if this is the case it s time for a new pc </s>
<s> good luck telephony facts analog digital explained </s>
<s> see the cnet faces behind the posts </s>

<s> if you re reading this thank a teacher </s>
<s> if you re reading this in english thank a u s soldier </s>
<s> its hard to know for sure but it sounds like your power supply may be the problem </s>
<s> you can buy one comparable to what you have and install it yourself just pay attention to everything you disconnect from the motherboard on its way out </s>
<s> you re only talking about a couple of connections and securing the supply to the board </s>
<s> its really fairly straightforward </s>
<s> if it works great </s>
<s> if not you ve not spent much trying to salvage your system </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> ls </s>
<s> hmm a device could be melting not likely though if that is the case a virus has severely damaged something </s>
<s> when they go they do sometimes blow up </s>
<s> an older computer like yours might have a different type of power supply than most of the newer systems </s>
<s> check the cords inside the computer that plug into the motherboard </s>
<s> if there are two connecters side by side then you have what is called an at power supply if it is one solid connector it is an atx power supply </s>
<s> those designations relate to the type of case by the way </s>
<s> another quick way to tell is if you have audio modem printer and serial connectors built into the motherboard </s>
<s> if there are several of those built right into the motherboard it is probably an atx motherboard which means you have an atx power supply but still check the connectors </s>
<s> at is the older type and will be harder to find i would also find someone who knows something about computers to hook it up for you since it can go in the wrong way </s>
<s> if it is atx then just buy one and hook it up make sure its in the right direction but that shouldn t be an issue </s>
<s> then you just hope the old one didn t fry anything else when it </s>
<s> went </s>
<s> you did not say what kind of computer you have </s>
<s> name brand or custom </s>
<s> some name brands have a non standard ps size like some emachines have a small 120 watt supply and there are a few others like that </s>
<s> so you will have to do some fact finding to get the correct one </s>
<s> hopefully the other parts are ok but the only way to find out is get a new ps and see what happnes </s>
