<s> host win98se with hp deskjet 932c ics and file printer sharing enabled </s>
<s> host to linksys switch switch to wap buffalo airstation wla l11g wap to wireless notebook xp pro </s>
<s> using ics and file printer sharing due to nature of satellite internet connection which has usb modem and requires said modem to be plugged directly to host computer running the direcway software so switching to a router is not an option at this time </s>
<s> no problem accessing shared printer </s>
<s> i can send a 467kb jpeg saved on notebook harddrive to printer in a few seconds </s>
<s> i can copy and paste same image to host drive in a few seconds </s>
<s> i can save a webpage with images in a folder on notebook hardrive and send folder 80kb to host in a few seconds </s>

<s> sending files to the host drive is fast </s>
<s> but when browsing the web on notebook and click to print the current webpage it takes 5 10 minutes to send the page to the printer </s>

<s> what am i missing here that causes this </s>
<s> you may want to research how to place an entry in your hosts file not hosts sam </s>
<s> to resolve the name of the print server </s>
<s> the outlook from here is that delays occur as windows tries to find the printer server by name </s>
<s> you can help speed this up </s>
