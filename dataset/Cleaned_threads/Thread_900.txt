<s> hello i have a node with one physical wireless interface and i need it to offer ap service to other nodes connect to an existed ap and connect to other nodes in ad hoc mode </s>
<s> if i create 3 logical wireless interfaces of that interface and configure each one respectively to the modes above would this work </s>
<s> do they use the same mac address or each needs to be configured a different one </s>
<s> and what is the disadvantages of this approach </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> hanibra </s>
<s> problem is if you really only have one radio it is this unit that has to run in the different modes </s>
<s> this is similar to the radios that can run b g n but not at the same time </s>
<s> they attempt to switch back and forth but are only somewhat successful </s>
<s> same with routers that claim to be dual band but only have a single radio that switches between 5g and 2 4g if you were to work for a chipset manufacture maybe you could integrate this type of switching function </s>
<s> trying to do it with software external to the chipset would be quite the challenge </s>
<s> the last time i was digging at that level you had to actually reinitialize the radio to change it from ap mode to client mode </s>
<s> i have seen some newer devices that claim easy changing of these mode but i would suspect they don t mean changing back and forth trying to emulate both devices at the same time </s>
<s> i came across a situation like that and their it staffer lost their job over it </s>
<s> they had spent months trying to solve it and the owner came to me out of desperation since the trade show was looming and they had to have it working </s>
<s> the it staffer was put to other work and we jerry rigged a solution using multiple aps and routers </s>
<s> their it staffer exploded and quit the next day and the show went off without a hitch </s>
<s> be sure you are not restricting your options here as they were </s>
<s> they were trying to do this with a single box </s>
