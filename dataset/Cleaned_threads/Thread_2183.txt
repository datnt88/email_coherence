<s> hey guys i just wanted to see if anyone could help me make a new computer config using newegg com or tigerdirect com </s>
<s> i was just going to get one off of a website or something but i really think building one would be fun and make the system hold a sense of ownership </s>
<s> all i really need is a setup that would work with the cpu and gpus i want i just dont know what else i would need like right size case cables and or other stuff like that </s>
<s> pretty much i need everthing else to house a amd 4000 cpu and two oced nvidia 7800 gt graphic cards and a 600watt sli rdy power supply </s>
<s> this is what i got so far off tigerdirect for bout a grand gt amd athlon 64 4000 1mb cache 2000mhz fsb socket 939 san diego core processor with fan gt two 2 xfx geforce 7800 gt overclocked 256mb ddr3 pci express video cards and an ultra x finity 600 watt power supply comes with 600 power supply i havnt done this before and im only looking to spend about 1600 but if there is a way to keep the price down i would like to have a fx53 cpu and no dual core stuff plz i know it rocks and i will upgrade later when every game is dual cored thanks </s>
<s> on my 4000 cpu should i get the clawhammer or san diego </s>
<s> here case your choice </s>
<s> but i would go for these 3 black silver need hard drive windows xp optical drives 1 gb of memory 1 tube of arctic silver thermal compound keyboard mouse speakers monitor </s>
<s> hmm 1600 for a system with dual overclocked 7800gt s and an fx 53 </s>
<s> sorry it won t happen </s>
<s> you said you want the 4000 and are going to upgrade in the future i suggested dual core but we had this conversation already in your previous post </s>
<s> why would you get a powerful processor like the 4000 when a cheaper alternative will work just fine </s>
<s> games aren t heavily depended on the processor memory and graphics card matter the most in gaming </s>
<s> here this would be my system build so that you won t have to spend a whole great deal now and you can upgrade in the future </s>
<s> processor case hard drive opticaldrive motherboard memory that is about all the parts you need right now </s>
<s> of course you got your power supply along with the graphics cards so no problem there </s>
<s> you will need your own copy of the os </s>
<s> the case i suggested is great because it allows for plenty of airflow critical for your hot running overclocked graphics cards </s>
<s> get some artic silver thermal compound if you are going to overclock the processor or in general want a reliable thermal compound </s>
<s> i believe the processor ships with the compound but that is the cheap kind </s>
<s> you might want more case fans or a better heatsink all up to you </s>
<s> the components is the list may tip over 1600 along with your graphics cards and your power supply but they are quality products that will last you for a long time </s>
<s> i m assuming you don t need monitor keyboard mouse speakers floppy drive media card reader printer don t forget operating system and arctic silver thermal compound </s>
