<s> the unfortunate happended to me over the weekend </s>
<s> i believe either my motherboard asus p4t533 c or cpu chip pentium 4 2 8 died since my pc won t boot post </s>
<s> my hard drives 2 western digital 120gb 7200rpm hard drives 8mb cache are raid configured no array the drives act as a single drive using a highpoint raid controller card rocketraid 133 a 2 channel ata133 raid adapter </s>
<s> does anyone have any suggestions about whether i can put the two drives in an external enclosure and still access them using another pc or an imac </s>
<s> i see a number of external enclosures that appear to be designed to accomidate raid drives but it is unclear with me if these will work </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> quot will they show my existing data files quot the answer from my experience is no </s>
<s> i ve yet to see many raid arrays survive even when we move the drives to the same chipset and controllers </s>
<s> this is a testament to the addage quot we only lose what we don t backup quot but those external raid capable nas boxes do work </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that is what i fear </s>
<s> luckly i backed up about 80 of the data on an external hard drive about 7 months ago </s>
<s> of course it was a one time thing so everything for the last 7 months has not been backed up </s>
<s> what is an external raid capable nas </s>
<s> is it worth giving this option a shot </s>
<s> if so what are my options </s>
<s> any particular brand model that is reasonably priced </s>
<s> this is a world wide forum </s>
<s> what i can get here in the usa may not be found in australia </s>
<s> you can use the usual search engines to find these products and then toss them up for comment by members </s>
<s> to recover your lost files the only method i find to work well is to repair the failed machine </s>
<s> could be cheap </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you can probably recover your array </s>
<s> put the card and drives in another pc and check if the controller card can still see the raid volume </s>
<s> if the card can t recognize it neither will any other setup </s>
<s> replacing the power supply </s>
<s> get a power supply tester for 12 15 like the one by coolmax or ultrax </s>
<s> i just helped replace the power supply in my daughter s pc it started acting up and then just died </s>
<s> replaced the ps and all was well </s>
<s> hoping same for you let us know </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
