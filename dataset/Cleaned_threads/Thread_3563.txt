<s> hey guys i am getting my first custom pc this weekend have a couple questions on what ya ll recommend and what all i can do with this pc set up specs are gigabyte ga p35 ds3l rev </s>
<s> 2 0 intel core 2 quad q8200 2 33ghz 45nm 1333mhz fsb 4mb l2 cache logisys 700watt psu 5 or 6gb cant remember ddr2 pc6400 800mhz dual channel expandable to 8gb ddr3 1066mhz dc seagate 320gb hdd 7200rpm 16mb cache 512mb video geforce forsa 6600 will this set up run win7 x64 good </s>
<s> i know the video card isnt too new would i need a new one to run windows 7 x64 better than with the one thats in it </s>
<s> do ya ll recommend upgrading to 8gb ddr3 </s>
<s> or should i stick with what i have for now </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> it s a nice system </s>
<s> it will run windows 7 x64 just fine </s>
<s> however what do you use your pc for </s>
<s> you called out the graphics card so i m guessing you are a gamer or like to watch videos or both </s>
<s> the one thing that stood out to me was the hard drive </s>
<s> seems pretty small but if you don t need to store a ton of music photos or videos than it s probably fine </s>
<s> i wouldn t worry about going to 8gb ram right away but if you think you will want to do that i would instead recommend going with the fastest ram your mobo supports and make sure you get the largest memory sticks for each socket </s>
<s> even if that means you get only 4gb of ram to start </s>
<s> that way if you want to upgrade later to more memory you won t have to throw out any old sticks to make room for newer ones </s>
<s> good luck and let us know how you like your new setup </s>
<s> im not wanting to do a whole lot i do watch movies and tv shows on my comp and would like to hook it up to my 24 quot tv as well ive just been looking at the graphics card and it just seems old i have just started getting into computers lately and just not up to date on what everything can do </s>
<s> just didnt know if the graphics card would hold up windows 7 x64 bit and not be laggy or anything </s>
<s> ya the hdd is a little small i will def </s>
<s> end up getting a new one pretty soon to add to that one and have 2 externals so i am good for storage for now </s>
<s> im mainly wanting to dual triple boot os x windows 7 and linux idk which one yet i dont do a whole lot of gaming as of now but i think with the new system i will start to for sure </s>
<s> just not sure how stable my graphics card is </s>
<s> thanks for the feedback appreciate it </s>
<s> best if both are hdmi second would be dvi and third would be a way to send component video to your tv </s>
<s> otherwise i think you ll be fine </s>
<s> sure a better graphics card is good but my own experience says don t spend the money now if it s something you quot think quot you might do </s>
<s> you may find you like doing other things on your new pc and don t have time to get into gaming </s>
<s> you can always upgrade the graphics card later and since you re getting into computing you ll probably find it s a pretty easy upgrade </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> my graphics card is good enough for now to run everything smoothly correct </s>
<s> that s the main thing i m worried about is that my graphics card is a little out of date </s>
<s> and that my system won t run windows 7 smoothly </s>
<s> i m sure in the future i will be upgrading to a newer one but for now if i don t have to then i don t want to worry about that </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> that system will run windows 7 perfectly </s>
<s> i have win7 running on a desktop and laptop with much lower spec s all round </s>
<s> you mention triple booting with osx </s>
<s> that might be a problem </s>
<s> osx is a bit iffy when not installing on apple s chosen hardware so i d do some research that your components are osx compatible </s>
<s> other than that you ll be fine </s>
<s> just make sure there s a win7 driver for the graphics card </s>
<s> hey mate that s an awesome configuration you got there and windows 7 x64 will easily run on it </s>
<s> no doubt about that </s>
<s> however for such a system i advice having more space on external hard disk than in built </s>
<s> 320 gb is cool but it s better you get an external hard disk of any size you want </s>
<s> save most of your data on it rather than your inbuilt space </s>
<s> this advice is coming out from the worst experience i had with high end systems </s>
<s> but all in all fantastic configuration you got there </s>
