<s> i m buying my next desktop </s>
<s> is there an advantage to having both a dvd rw and a cd rw </s>
<s> or will i be happy with just one drive that does it all my instinct is just to get only the dvd rw but i want to make sure i m not missing something </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> for having two consider </s>
<s> speed of transfer during copies </s>
<s> wear and tear on a single drive </s>
<s> redundancy if a failure ocurrs </s>
<s> speeds offered for pure reads on one versus the other </s>
<s> i now have a dual setup </s>
<s> a dvrom and an all format 4x dvd rw </s>
<s> i like it </s>
<s> next time since prices have crashed on dvd recorders i ll just get 2 of the same in the machine </s>
<s> last night s midnight madness sale has 8x optowrites for about 49 bucks </s>
<s> go figure where this madness ends </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> bob s answer is the most workable solution nowdays </s>
<s> a dvd rom will play either dvds or cds </s>
<s> a dvd rw will burn either dvds or cds </s>
<s> by the way bob i have been happy with the btc badged as emprex 8x multi format i got for 70 at fry s </s>
<s> not the fastest out but i m not so busy i can t wait 20 more seconds </s>
<s> i am curious why dvd media prices haven t really come down </s>
<s> unless i m missing something they cost the same pennies to manufacture as cds </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> try the last 50 packs of dvd r or dvd r i picked out at a midnight madness sale </s>
<s> try 11 75 for 50 while it can t beat officemax s 200 cd pack they offered for zero bucks after rebate which you still paid tax and mailing fees so that was about 4 bucks i can see that per gigabyte the prices are on par with cdr </s>

<s> quot i am curious why dvd media prices haven t really come down </s>
<s> unless i m missing something they cost the same pennies to manufacture as cds quot it would be if the volumes were the same as cd s which they haven t quite matched yet </s>
<s> in fact sam s club is dropping blank dvd s or so i was told when shopping locally for them </s>
<s> even though the technology is similar for manufacturing it is different enough that if the volume isn t there the price stays higher </s>
<s> and of course there is quot what the market will bear quot </s>
<s> think about getting a dual layer burner </s>
<s> i think they burn like 8 5gb or so </s>
<s> might be a bit costly at first </s>
