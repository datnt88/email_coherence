<s> i have a dell 4550 running a p4 2 6 with 1 gig of ram </s>
<s> my current video card is a geforce4 ti4800 agp </s>
<s> the card has been wonderful and i play almost all games with video settings maxed out </s>
<s> i ve been wanting to get a new video card simply because i can t play games like battlefield2 because the geforce4 isn t directx 9 compliant or something along those lines </s>
<s> can anyone recommend a good card that would work for me </s>
<s> i m looking to spen around 150 250 </s>
<s> i ve been looking at a geforce 6800 but to be honest i can t sort out the different models too well </s>
<s> i have a 4x agp controller </s>
<s> on a simple level will i be seeing any improvement going to an 8x card </s>
<s> yeah i believe a 6800 is your best bet when it comes to a agp slot </s>
<s> this seems like a very nice one </s>
<s> or if your for little more power this would be a very nice addition and it seems to be in your price range </s>
<s> especially for bf2 which is a keeper to put in the video game library </s>
