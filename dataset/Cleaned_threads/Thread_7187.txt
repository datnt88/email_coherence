<s> does anyone know what external speakers work with the acer netbook </s>
<s> i m using tweaker portable speakers for my laptop but would like something a little better which could be powered by the usb port instead of ac or charging a battery like the tweaker speakers </s>
<s> philips cushion speakers sdc5100 if you are using your laptop a lot on your lap this is your thing </s>
<s> it keeps the laptop cooler and takes the power from usb </s>
<s> sound is pretty good too not brilliant </s>
<s> i m going to be using this acer netbook to play and store mp3 s only </s>
<s> i called the acer company but they don t sell external speakers and they couldn t tell me which external speakers would work with my acer netbook </s>
<s> that can be connected should work </s>
<s> why not take your laptop with you to the speaker shop and try </s>
<s> don t expect any quality however from a speaker that doesn t have its own power cord </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i need to be positive that the speakers will work </s>
<s> i bought some usb powered speakers from best buy to use with my hp lap top that were suppose to work but it blew my power supply and i had to spend over 100 to get a new one </s>
<s> is standardized 5 2v 500 ma that s 2 6w </s>
<s> so any device suitable for usb power shouldn t have blown the power supply that s 30w or 40w for the netbook especially if you dimmed the screen to have that use less power </s>
<s> maybe they were defective and something short circuited </s>
<s> is there anything in the documentation from acer about maximum power the usb can safely deliver </s>
<s> if not that s the question to ask their customer service </s>
<s> then you have the specs for your speakerset </s>
<s> however the usb power of a laptop generally is less than the usb power of a desktop especially when they run on battery making usb powered speakers definitely not the first choice </s>
<s> as i said any externally powered speakerset should be ok kees </s>
<s> thanks for the reply but i m still not going to buy any external speakers unless i know positively that they will work will my acer netbook </s>
<s> it s pretty sad when tech support for acer couldn t even answer this question </s>
<s> if a headphone works externally powered speakers will work also </s>
<s> in all other cases you re stuck </s>
<s> acer won t guarantee that any usb powered stuff they don t sell themselves will work </s>
<s> no maker of any usb powered stuff will guarantee that it will work with your acer and not blow it up </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks for your added reply </s>
<s> acer doesn t make any external speakers for the netbooks </s>
<s> i am using my bose music system as the speakers for my desk top computer and the cable is plugged into the aux in of the bose </s>
<s> i was wondering if they make an audio cable with 2 ends so that i could have one end hooked to my computer for speakers and one end to plug into my acer netbook so i could use the bose as speakeks for my netbook as well </s>
<s> the earphone jack on the bose system is not being used and i was wondering if i got a cable and plugged it into that jack and the other end into the netbook s jack if that would work </s>
<s> i don t have the netbook yet to try this </s>
