<s> hello i use itunes on my computer to play my music </s>
<s> my main music folder is called quot my music quot </s>
<s> if i am attaching a mini ipod to my pc computer will it transfer the music even though the music does not exist in the itunes music library folder </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> the ipod has a files mode which you can place music files into but such will not play </s>
<s> this is by design </s>
<s> to get music into the ipod the apple way you import such into itunes and have it convert them and put them into the ipod </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so even though i play all of my music in itunes anyway with playlists if the music is not in the itunes folder it will not copy over to the ipod automatically </s>
<s> is that correct </s>
<s> and if it is then it sounds like the quickest solution is to open itunes and add the filles back into it again except this time make sure the option quot copy into itunes folder when adding to the library quot is checked in the advanced settings </s>
<s> is this correct </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> you should try that </s>
<s> but your last reply is slightly different from your first post </s>
<s> i may have missed it but some do get confused over that quot files quot mode </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so if i confused you a little bit but am i correct in saying that it has to be in the actual itunes folder </s>
<s> quot it has to be in the actual itunes folder quot afaik </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> the content has to be encoded with apple s drm i d rather not dive into that area so the content on the ipod is not shared </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thank you </s>
