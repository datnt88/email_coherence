<s> in the near future i plan to build my own pc the problem i encounter is the graphics card i want an ati radeon hd 4770 i life in spain and all that i can find is asus xfx club 3d powercoler sapphire radeon hd 4770 and nothing like ati radeon hd 4770 is not even listed on amd spain site the question is 1 the only difference between these cards and ati radeon hd 4770 is the name </s>
<s> the perfomance will be the same on all cards </s>
<s> 2 128 bit is it a big problem </s>
<s> your 1st ques ati makes the gpu graphics processing unit which is then embedded on a graphic card which is manufactured by asus xfx club 3d powercoler sapphire etc </s>
<s> your 2nd ques the 128 bit bandwidth of radeon hd 4770 having gddr5 memory is about thrice faster than graphics card with gddr3 memory having the same clock freqeuncy </s>
<s> so its the best card in its price range sometimes even better than some of the pricier ones like raadeon hd 4850 so go for radeon hd 4770 with no hesitation </s>
<s> well know that everything is clear all i need to say is thank you </s>
<s> practically impossible to find </s>
<s> if you can find one it s 120 usd or more </s>
<s> hd 4850 512mb is still a bit faster and manufacturers have dropped its price 105 </s>
<s> hd 4870 512mb and hd 4850 1gb is down to 125 </s>
<s> so either is a better and readily available choice than the hd 4770 now </s>
<s> spain sites are all full with radeon hd 4770 so it s very easy to find one and costs around 110dollar also the 40nm process technology is more appealing and is gddr5 against 4850 that s gddr3 i just like more 4770 </s>
<s> is not that i like more radeon hd 4770 i think that 40nm gddr5 makes better and still i m not decided what card to buy every advice counts </s>
