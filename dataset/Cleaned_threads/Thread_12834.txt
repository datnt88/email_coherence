<s> i am using dell dimension 3000 computer with dell e173 fp flat panel color monitor less that two years </s>
<s> yesterday when i turned on the computer i have seen only black screen </s>
<s> the power led was green </s>
<s> when i turned off and then on the power of the monitor the screen was normal several seconds i saw icons on the screen and then became black again </s>
<s> i ran self test pattern and i think that the monitor does not pass it because the self test pattern does not scroll through the screen continually </s>
<s> it appeared in the left bottom corner of the screen and then in a second disappeared </s>
<s> please let me know where is the problem </s>
<s> how to solve it now instead of computer monitor i am using tv screen </s>
<s> hence the problem is only with monitor </s>
<s> how to solve it </s>
<s> thank you in advance for help </s>
<s> check the warranty but on lcd flat screens there is little an owner can fix </s>
<s> other test </s>
<s> try the screen on another pc </s>

<s> thanks for response </s>
<s> i do not have the warranty </s>
<s> do you think that i can fix the monitor myself </s>
<s> how to do it </s>
<s> i tried already the screen on another pc </s>
<s> the screen remains black </s>
<s> unless you get lucky and it s something like we see discussed at what electronics background do you have </s>
<s> for example i have not only a volt meter but the usual oscilloscope and other electronic repair items in my little home lab </s>
<s> if the warranty can t be extended what stops you from opening it up and looking for bad solder joints or burnt spots </s>

<s> dear bob thank you very much for your response </s>
<s> you wrote if the warranty can t be extended what stops you from opening you are second time paid my attention to the warranty of the monitor </s>
<s> the warranty of my computer system was 90 days and i thought the monitor has the same warranty time period </s>
<s> after your second e mail i started to read carefully the product information guide and have learned that my monitor has a 3 year limited warranty </s>
<s> i called dell and they replaced the monitor with the refurbished one </s>
<s> it works very well </s>
<s> best regards peter </s>
<s> thanks for posting that it all worked out </s>
