<s> howdy my computer has begun to run very slowly and i just recieved a warning that the vitrual memory is low </s>
<s> i am trying to figure out how to remedy this </s>
<s> first let me tell you what i have done to the computer </s>
<s> i added a plug and play cd rom and storage device i also have a slave drive running the computer </s>
<s> i use the plugin device for downloading but run the programs from the c drive </s>
<s> besides that i have basic windows and microsoft word stuff and two video games </s>
<s> any good place to start </s>
<s> what are my virus or otherwise potential </s>
<s> oh i have a gateway that is about two years old and run windows xp thank you much steve </s>
<s> ewido and housecall to eject what they find </s>
<s> i don t supply direct links because we have google com and other fine search engines </s>

<s> is when you computer has run out of system ram and has started using you hard drive space for the same task </s>
<s> low virtual memory warings often indicates your hard drive is virtually full and may appear only when you re using programs like m word and games which use a huge amount of system ram virtual memory </s>
<s> 1 double click quot my computer quot icon on your desktop 2 right click drive c 3 choose quot properties quot it s at the bottom of the list 4 in the general tab running along the top click the quot disk cleanup quot button 5 put a checkmark in all the boxes and click quot ok quot you can do that on all your drives too to recover wasted space </s>
<s> modern games can easily take a couple of gigabytes of hard drive storage space each and the system files such as pagefile and virtual memory are another couple each too </s>
<s> you didn t detail anything but this can easily use up a lot of hard drive space and then you ll get virtual memory errors </s>
<s> good luck geebee </s>
