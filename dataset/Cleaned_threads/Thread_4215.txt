<s> so i own a dell inspiron m5010 which came equipped with a 320gb 5400 rpm samsung spinpoint m7 hm321hi hdd </s>
<s> after about 3 months the hdd became unusable due to a high count of bad sectors gt 500 </s>
<s> i ve replaced the broken hdd with a brand new identical hdd which reached a bad sector count of over 250 in 1 month </s>
<s> i have then upgraded the hdd to a 500gb 7200 rpm samsung spinpoint m7 hm500ji at the moment it has 166 bad sectors in about 2 months of usage </s>
<s> i did not use the laptop under harsh conditions it is not filled with dust it did not suffer mechanical shocks </s>
<s> what should i be on the lookout for </s>
<s> the current hdd temperature varries from 42 45 when idling to 52 54 when playing a video game or using it extensively and the cpu temperature is always above 59 degrees celsius even when first booting up the laptop </s>
<s> also the original power supply stopped working after 4 months since i purchased the laptop and i have replaced it with another 90w power supply </s>
<s> fun fact a few 1 8 sectors were being marked as quot bad quot almost every time the song changed in an youtube playlist not always but most of the time </s>
<s> why are you repairing this thing </s>
<s> something is broken </s>
<s> let dell fix it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes it wasn t even half year old when i had to replace the first hdd </s>
<s> i was abroad and i didn t have access to any dell authorized shops therefore i had to replace the hdd myself and i lost the warranty </s>
<s> by the way i have the m5010 with an amd phenom ii quad core p920 cpu </s>
<s> note this post was edited by a forum moderator to remove link which is not needed on 09 12 2011 at 10 07 am pt </s>
<s> to check power supply levels the next part to swap is the motherboard </s>
<s> and a new drive of course </s>
