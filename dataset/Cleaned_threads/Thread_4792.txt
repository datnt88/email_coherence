<s> i am a junior it manager and i need to strongly protect all my applications software on an external drive </s>
<s> in such a way that nobody would be able to copy or paste anything into the drive but at the same time they should be able to run an executable installer from same drive i e we should be able to run any software installation from same drive pls kindly help me with answers </s>
<s> but the problems you find with such has people screaming about losing their files </s>
<s> yes there is such but you won t see me find or mention it by name </s>
<s> i hope you understand that i can t help others lose their stuff </s>

<s> its like i dont get u clearly pls let me explain myself using an illustration i have an adobe installer which is inside an external hdd i want to give out this hdd to a person to install adobe from it but i dont want that person to tamper with the adobe just install and return my hdd i e dont copy my adobe or corrupt it </s>
<s> please what can i do or is there any advance external hdd i can purchase that has this features </s>
<s> thanks proffit </s>
<s> sorry you just stepped over a line where you don t find a solution </s>
<s> if i can install i can copy </s>
<s> thanks for clearing up with an example </s>
<s> there is no such tool today </s>
<s> and very little call for it </s>
<s> yes you can cite microsoft s quot activation quot but are you ready to write such a thing </s>
<s> the cost seems more than a copy of adobe </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> many thanks proffitt </s>
<s> but note that i was just using adobe as an illustration </s>
<s> i have some softwares that cost several thousands of dollars and that need to be prevented from copying but can be installed </s>
<s> i would nt mind buying the tool if available </s>
<s> pls proffitt what do you suggest i can do </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> you mentioned adobe as an example but of course if you are letting others use copies of your adobe installer or any other retail commercial and full software titles then you may fall foul of copyright and piracy issues </s>
<s> that s difficult to discuss because forum policy forbids discussion of piracy in these forums </s>
<s> but that aside the problem is this </s>
<s> if you were to give me your external hard drive i would be able to copy everything off it </s>
<s> i wouldn t even need specialised software to do that </s>
<s> as bob says there is no fool proof method of protecting files in this situation </s>
<s> this isn t like some vhs tape where you can copy protect the contents </s>
<s> if you give anyone access to an installer file on a hard drive then they can copy it </s>
<s> you can quot encrypt quot any disk </s>
<s> but if you want to allow others to use a file from that disk you need to give them access to it </s>
<s> if they can read a file they can copy it </s>
<s> also if you lose that encryption key for instance if you have some windows failure and need to reinstall windows then even you cannot get access to your own files </s>
<s> mark mark </s>
<s> thank you and thank you so much for the reply </s>
<s> i really appreciate your effort </s>
<s> god bless </s>
<s> you are in a company and you have some corporate version of your app and you need to control its install and use </s>
<s> let s use the old fashioned controls </s>
<s> you never let the installer out of your control </s>
<s> i understand your example but hope you understand the limitation of the windows and pc systems </s>
