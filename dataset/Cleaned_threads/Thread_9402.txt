<s> i have a hp xl759 desktop and it became obvious to me that i needed more ram </s>
<s> when my computer boots it loads three programs </s>
<s> after it boots i checked the system status and noted that only about 40 of the installed 256 mb memory was available i e 60 was being used by the start up programs so i decided to double the memory </s>
<s> i checked hp website for applicable ram and then installed the recommendation of hp upto the max amount allowed by this pc 512 mb </s>
<s> once installed i checked the system again upon booting up and the computer recognizes sees the ram but it still says only about 40 of the installed 512 mb ram is available as if the computer can see the additional ram but it isn t using it </s>
<s> any ideas on how to solve my problem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the memory articles at should help you understand how windows uses memory </s>
<s> such memory if not used by an application will eventually be used to cache hard disk data or some other dll </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> simply put because you updated the ram you cannot then assume your system will show that much more available </s>
<s> as rob stated the o s will find a use for the extra ram you ve given it </s>
<s> whether that be for cacheing hard disk data or whatever </s>
<s> generally the more ram you have the better it may not show that in the being used but you may find a marked system performance increase because the o s generally has to rely less on the pagefile or quot virtual ram quot on your hard disk </s>
<s> reading and writing to and from physical ram is drmatically faster than to and from the hard disk </s>
<s> simply put the more ram you have the more the computer will use because if it goes to the physical ram looking for something and doesn t find it there it ll look in the quot virtual ram quot on the hard disk decreasing the time performance for that function </s>
<s> the more that can be loaded into the physical ram the better </s>
<s> thanks for the info </s>
