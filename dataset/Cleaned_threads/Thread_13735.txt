<s> i d like to know how to quot delete quot a single backed up folder searched the manual and help and it just seems to describe to use the quot reformat quot feature i must be missing something as this would erase the operating software for the hard drive it s self </s>
<s> and i would be guessing if i guessed you were asking about some backup software but to delete a folder in explorer is pretty basic for a windows user </s>
<s> they click on the folder then tap the delete key </s>

<s> sorry i didn t make that clear i can t find how to delete a back up folder on the western digital external hard drive the only reference is to right click on the drive icon and click quot format quot on the drop down menu all i have stored on this external drive at present is my quot music folder quot </s>
<s> again i would have to guess if there was some backup application in play here </s>
<s> i don t use any that come with drives since i found them buggy trouble and proprietary </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> are you using the windows 7 backup program the wd supplied backup program something else what </s>
<s> personally i ve been using norton ghost for the last 8 years and haven t had the first problem with it </s>

<s> good luck </s>
