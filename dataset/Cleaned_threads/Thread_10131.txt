<s> hi every1 i had a computer i built but sold it and am looking for a new agp video card to go with my dell dimension 4500 right now i am looking at the his radeon 2600 xt of the 7800 gs but i read somewhere that the nvidia is not recommended for dells but oh well i took the advice of another person and bought a new pc power and cooling dell 410 2 psu so im not worried but here is the 7800 which do guys think i should buy </s>
<s> srry bout double post but i also wanted to say im buying 1 of these cards for gaming with games such as crysis if possible carbon moh airborn and cod 4 </s>
<s> try agp cards from this list gt i like to see you in the 7950 gx2 8800 gs 9600 gt x1950 xtx or better cards </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> will the user s 4x slot be a limiter </s>
<s> will going too far up scale be a waste as the slot can not feed the card </s>
<s> 8x cards run in 4x slots just fine </s>
<s> if you feel this is a waste then its time to replace the machine </s>
<s> ive decided on the 2600xt b c it only needs 300 watt psu and the 7800 needs 400 so i think the 2600 is a better idea or way to go thx for the help guys ill be back soon with another question </s>
