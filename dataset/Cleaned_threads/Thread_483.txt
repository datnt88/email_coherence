<s> hello everybody need your help to find a good solution to my problem i have already found some bad ones lets start with basics i have a msi z77a gd65 motherboard on this i have 2x sata and 4x sata3 and two i cant seem to be able to use </s>
<s> i have one 120g ssd for os and most programs dvd 2 hdd for media and 2 hdd in raid 1 for safe storage </s>
<s> so i run bios in raid as this is the way as i know it to handle the raid 1 setup </s>
<s> i only use one pci express slots for my geforce gtx 670 at the moment </s>
<s> problem bf4 is coming to town and i only have 17g free on my ssd </s>
<s> i really want to have theses games on a ssd as i have latency in games and when its loading a new game </s>
<s> my plan is to get a new 250g ssd to have all games and sw and only keep the os more or less on the old ssd </s>
<s> the problem is that i have no more free sata slots </s>
<s> solution i have looked at several controller cards as that seems to be a possible way to go if possible a sata6 version </s>
<s> but as i have understood now it might not be possible to get any speed from this controllers </s>
<s> example asus u3s6 have also read something about not being able to use bios in raid mode when using this cards </s>
<s> how do i setup my raid 1 in that case </s>
<s> hope you can come up with some suitable solutions for me without replacing the mb joshen </s>
<s> hdds with more disk space </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> you could buy an expansion card with a sata port and connect your dvd drive to that </s>
<s> that frees up one mobo sata port </s>
<s> you could also buy an ssd big enough to hold both your os and games </s>
<s> that frees up another sata port </s>
<s> since you have your os and games on an ssd what are you using raid for </s>
<s> backup </s>
<s> if so get hold of a good 3rd party backup program like easeus todo backup free which you can download from </s>
<s> you can set it up to do automatic backups at the time and frequency of your choice </s>
<s> then you could back up to an external hard drive freeing up at least one more sata port </s>
<s> there ve been a lot of posts on the net about why raid is problem prone so avoiding it is a good idea in any event </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> yes the raid is for backup </s>
<s> have two additional external backups of witch one is off site as well photos 150gb documents and other important stuff i have been thinking about only having one of them internally and making a mirror to the external one every night instead </s>
<s> and this would let me change one of them to something quieter as well not a completely bad solution i m getting a new 250gb ssd so yes keeping that one as an external quot extra quot unit is one way to do it as i have an empty usb3 external case lying around </s>
<s> that would be a fast one but not that large the other hdd are 2 and 3tb so replacing them with something bigger is not much of an idea </s>
<s> connecting the dvd to the extension card have been on my mind as that is the one i use the least but i use it every other week so far moving one of them externally and giving up the raid is looking like the best way to go </s>
<s> i think i will need to make a check of the raided hdd to check the helth of them </s>
<s> can any of you recommend a good program to do that i haven t had a lot of good results with that previously </s>
<s> i have a hdd on my desk that i have replaced get the ok from the check programs but sounds like a grinder from time to time </s>
<s> something bigger is not much of an idea quot it was a good logical idea considering you made no mention of the existing disk sizes </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> you can run chkdsk and let it identify and attempt repair of any bad sectors </s>
<s> you can also download disk diagnostics from western digital and seagate </s>
<s> there is a windows 7 control panel tool called performance information and tools which will check a lot of things including your hard drive s smart data and disk performance information </s>
<s> there is a windows 7 control panel tool called performance information and tools which will check a lot of things including your hard drive s smart data perhaps i m blind but where on that screen do you see smart data </s>
<s> click start gt control panel gt performance information and tools gt advanced tools gt generate a system health report </s>
<s> it will take 60 seconds to collect the data then another minute to generate a report </s>
<s> then look in the basic system tests and click the next to disks and voila there it is </s>
<s> then below there you can click the little down arrow to the far right of where it says disks and again where it says disk totals and physical disks there s a bunch more info </s>
<s> no doubt it is a bit cryptic to get to it but persistence pays </s>
<s> it is a bit cryptic to get there and when you do finally get there it does not tell you much </s>
<s> i think i ll stick with this tool </s>
<s> seems a bit quicker and easier to use </s>
