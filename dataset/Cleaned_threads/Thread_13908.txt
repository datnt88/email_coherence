<s> hello this is a great laser printer infallible service for nearly one year </s>
<s> but currently it s began to show a black speckled smudged area some 1 quot 2 quot wide descending vertically through the approximate middle of the page </s>
<s> i ve checked the dummy lights for toner or drum issues but nothing there yet actually it may be early in the problem and just not showing yet </s>
<s> but wondered if anyone had similar problems and what this line indicated </s>
<s> thanks much </s>
<s> it may need the drum kit or some toner got to some roller </s>
<s> the drum kit upsets some owners since it s a bit more expensive than toner but it doesn t last forever </s>
<s> i found the hp method of drum and toner to avoid this issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the difficulty so far has been the diagnosis ebay has the toner cartridge at 40 but the drum may be a store manufacturer item big bucks likely i haven t moved or jiggled the printer in any way so hard to know what s going on </s>
<s> maybe the idiot lights will come on soon thanks much </s>
<s> you are squarely where i see many with this toner and drum kits </s>
<s> the owner doesn t want to pop for the drum kit because they want an assurance it will fix it yet the drum kit and what it changes would and could cause this </s>
<s> you are not alone here in your feelings </s>
<s> gt the jiggle issue is a non issue </s>
<s> the paper picks up toner and could move it to somewhere where it will now produce lines or patterns </s>
<s> i know we want maintenance no cleaning required devices but they don t make such yet </s>
<s> there is one alternative </s>
<s> make the call to the service center and get their feelings on the matter </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> calling the tech guys is probably best if i get some good hard facts on which symptoms indicate which purchase required i ll get back </s>
<s> i ve already seen the toners on ebay at 40 bucks and the drum assembly at 70 bucks so neither is a deal breaker </s>
<s> their owners manual offers really nothing on maintenance written by the lawyers of course </s>
<s> thanks eric </s>
