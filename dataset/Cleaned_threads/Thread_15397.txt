<s> i want to archive an image of a dvd that i made </s>
<s> i know that when i write to the dvd recorder the dvd will be written as r or r depending upon the media in the drive </s>
<s> in the future i want to use a dvd iso image to write to dvd s </s>
<s> is the iso image of a dvd different if it was made from a r or r dvd </s>
<s> can i just make an image from a r dvd and then later write it back to a r dvd </s>
<s> i ll write no and share it s never been an issue </s>
<s> i even put such on rw both types </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> as far as the iso image is concerned they are the same the media itself however is different </s>
<s> it depends on what sort of iso file you have and what you re going to do with it </s>
<s> as a back up for a movie which you want to use in any stand alone player the image must be burned to a r disc of course the iso file is one single file and won t be recognized as a movie or music and so must be burned differently many players will only read the r and won t recognize the r format </s>
<s> if you intend to use the image of an operating system r is fine as long as your burners recognize the r format </s>
<s> the dvd r rw format offers subtle extra functionality for people who record their own movies and audio </s>
<s> 1 instantly eject without having to wait for finalized formatting </s>
<s> 2 ability to record one dvd disc partially on pc and partially on television </s>
<s> 3 background formatting while the disc is being formatted you can simultaneously record on already formatted portions of the same disc </s>
<s> 4 enhanced ability to edit filenames movie and song titles and playlists </s>
<s> 5 </s>
<s> 100 compatibility with all other dvd players while still enjoying these extra recording features </s>
<s> something else to consider is quality of the media </s>
<s> many manufacturers produce a quot value line quot of both formats these are sketchy at best for archival uses </s>
<s> bottom line you get what you pay for </s>
