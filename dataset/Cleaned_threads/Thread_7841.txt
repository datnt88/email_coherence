<s> so i just finished building a core 2 duo pc for a friend and now that everythings in and all the power switch won t turn it on </s>
<s> for some reason the power led is on though faint </s>
<s> i reconnected all the front panel stuff and made sure they were in the correct places but to no avail </s>
<s> also the mobo supports a 24 pin power but i used a 20 pin </s>
<s> it said it could use 20 pin too </s>
<s> also the 12v connector had 8 slots but i used a p4 cable instead </s>
<s> these might be the problem but i m not sure </s>
<s> url link url url link url any ideas </s>

<s> yeah the 20 pin fit into the 24 pin in the right slots it s idiot proof </s>
<s> the jpwr2 8pin has a p4 12v 4pin cable in the 4 slots that weren t originally covered up with a little plastic thingy </s>
<s> as for the molex i stuck a molex into it from the psu </s>
<s> hope this is all right </s>
<s> esp vodeo card </s>
<s> motherboard manual suggests 450w psu looks as if what you have is either 350w or optionally 380w is that right </s>
