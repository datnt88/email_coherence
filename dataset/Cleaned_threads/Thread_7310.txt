<s> i purchased a wireless g network card for my laptop to use on my vacation </s>
<s> then i got the bright idea to get a wireless card for my desktop just to see if i could get the laptop to talk to the desktop </s>
<s> but after reading the info that came with the pci card it seems i can not do that </s>
<s> i did not try it yet and figure i would ask if it will work before i try it </s>
<s> now i have no wireless access point or router or anything on that line just 2 computers with wireless cards </s>
<s> all i want to do is make sure the card in the laptop will work while i am away </s>
<s> thanks gene </s>
<s> to be able to connect to your desktop you need a hub switch or a router if you want to go wireless then you need an accesspoint if you want to go online you need to subscribe to an internet provider and a modem dial up broadband adsl satelite </s>
<s> there are no hotspots anywhere near me and i just wanted to be sure the notebook card worked </s>
<s> quite a few of the motels i am going to stay in next month have wireless access and i wanted it to work </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> of the cards by switching from infrastructure to ad hoc mode </s>
<s> if working the two cards will see each other and the other pc in my network places assuming me 2k or xp </s>
