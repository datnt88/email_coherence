<s> hi there i ve got a friend with a generic pc put together with heaven knows what no brand names </s>
<s> he said it was working just fine then one day stopped </s>
<s> it looks to me like the pc just isn t booting up </s>
<s> when you turn on the power the hard drive light comes on for about 30 seconds or so then nothing </s>
<s> it doesn t sound like it s going through any post or any kind of startup and there s no signal to the monitor </s>
<s> what are the most common causes of this kind of problem and what should i be checking </s>
<s> thanks to everyone anyone in advance for their replies and advice </s>
<s> regards gary </s>
<s> what is usually done is the monitor is tried on a working machine and a working monitor tried on the failed machine </s>
<s> causes are simple </s>
<s> age heat and broken parts </s>
<s> the trick for home repair is to guess which part </s>
<s> for home repair this can be tough since you might not have a spare video card to see if that was it </s>

<s> hi bob thanks for your response </s>
<s> it s not the monitor or the video card </s>
<s> i did try another monitor just for the heck of it and there was no change </s>
<s> but the problem is not simply that i m not getting a display </s>
<s> the problem is that the pc does not appear to be booting at all </s>
<s> it has power but there is no startup activity no beeps no flashing lights on the keyboard no sound of activity on the hard drive or floppy drive etc </s>
<s> i was just wondering if this was specifically indicitave of anything obvious such as a bad motherboard </s>
<s> the only thing i ve tried so far was removing the memory chip and disconnecting the hard drive no difference </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> regards gary </s>
<s> no monitor required </s>
<s> four parts cpu hsf heatsinkfan motherboard psu power supply unit speaker </s>
<s> nothing else </s>
<s> no cards memory keyboard ide cables nothing but the 4 parts </s>
<s> no beeps means you ve narrowed it down to those four parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
