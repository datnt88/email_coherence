<s> all computers at this location access the internet wirelessly through an 802 1g wireless router which is cabled directly to a dsl modem </s>
<s> the wireless network is not encrypted and frequently interlopers can be found camped onto my internet connection </s>
<s> usually mac filtering fixes this but what i would like to do is to log traffic to and from the internet </s>
<s> can this be done from the router or by bridging the hard wired connection between the router and the dsl modem </s>
<s> how difficult can this be </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> there are very simple hack tools that let others use wep and mac filtered networks </s>
<s> to solve this issue is very very simple </s>
<s> enable wpa broadcast the ssid and no mac filters </s>
<s> done </s>
<s> yes i realize this but a couple of the computers here are older and won t do wpa </s>
<s> anyhow i d sincerely like to hack embarrass these nefarious campers </s>
<s> turn off the wifi when you can </s>
<s> remember that wep even with mac filtering is cracked in about 2 minutes with the right software </s>
<s> hopefully you can get the old gear wired and off the air soon </s>

<s> if your router has a mirror monitor option then you can do that but most consumer routers do not </s>
<s> first you need a packet capture program and a pc you can leave running to capture it </s>
<s> wireshark is your best bet since its free and works very well the harder problem will be getting into the data stream </s>
<s> a old hub if they still make those would work between the router and the dsl modem </s>
<s> they make real ethernet taps but they are rather expensive </s>
<s> the most common way to do this is with a switch that has the ability to quot mirror quot traffic </s>
<s> you will need a switch is manageable ie you can log into </s>
<s> they are some consumer ones but the cheapest way to buy a old cisco or 3com on ebay </s>
<s> even the very old switches can do this </s>
<s> you still have the issue of knowing which traffic is valid and which is not </s>
<s> all traffic will appear to come from the address on the router so it will be more difficult to know if it is your traffic or your intruders traffic </s>
<s> to a point it will be obvious if they are visiting sites you do not </s>
<s> just the answer i was looking for thanks very much </s>
<s> i ll initiate a search for that old hub and see what i can find </s>
<s> i already have wireshark this ought to be fun </s>
<s> hi as for me i used protemac meter for monitoring traffic i liked </s>
