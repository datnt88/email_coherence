<s> it use to work under xp </s>
<s> ok i wasn t able to burn cdr s with it any more </s>
<s> but it read cd s fine </s>
<s> but just recently i go to install a game but find the cd rom is missing </s>
<s> so i go into device manager its listed but as disabled </s>
<s> well the device usage option is set enabled </s>
<s> but device status says this device is disabled </s>
<s> code 22 click enable device to enable this device </s>
<s> when i do so it simple states windows was not able to enable this device it does show up under win98 which i have duel boot </s>
<s> this cd rw has never needed a specific driver for it </s>
<s> regardless i did do a search for drivers and came up empty </s>
<s> all driver searches lead me to firmware update </s>
<s> which i m reluctant to install when i m not sure i need it worked before under default firmware and when i don t know how to find out my current firmware </s>
<s> i can t think of anything else </s>
<s> i haven t made any changes to speak of to my system other then installing a sound card that only runs under win98 because it has no xp drivers but that was some time ago and i m pretty sure i remembered my cd rom working after that under xp this is very peculiar </s>
<s> i find this happens when xp is installed but the person installing xp is unaware about motherboard drivers </s>
<s> many are just discovering that microsoft does not do this for us as well as we should avoid any driver offered by windows update </s>
<s> you didn t write about the machine so i can t offer what driver package i d try </s>
<s> try this </s>
<s> boot xp and remove the cdrom in the device manager </s>
<s> on reboot xp will add it back in </s>
<s> if it s a simple issue that may do the trick </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i already installed mobo drivers </s>
<s> thanks removing and readding the cdrom drive sotra worked but planescape torment when i got to a new area it wants the cd even though the cd s in there </s>
<s> i don t have this trouble under win98 </s>
<s> other times with other programs it sometimes has trouble seeing the cd under xp but not win98 </s>
<s> mobo ga 71xe thunderbird athlon 750 </s>
<s> the cd that came with is likely out of date </s>
<s> i d hit the motherboard maker s web site for latest </s>
<s> i can write with authority that microsoft and the update driver will not do the trick </s>
<s> also you may need better cdrw recording software </s>
<s> windows xp s native recording is so so about all drives </s>
