<s> everything works quite good and fast until i start multi tasking </s>
<s> once i usually start running winamp yahoo messanger aim and a variety of programs my music start pausing </s>
<s> my mouse bairly moving </s>
<s> i check the task manager and i notice the cpu usage spiking </s>
<s> sometimes its at 100 sometimes less </s>
<s> even after i close all the programs down my computer lags for the rest of the session </s>
<s> the cpu keeps spiking up and down </s>
<s> the wierd part is that in quot processes quot the cpu does not add up to the quot cpu usage quot at the bottom of the screen </s>
