<s> i am sure this has been asked but i don t see it on the forum buying a workstation to run cpu intense programs statistics programs but also want to be able to run standard programs at the same time eg word plus internet email client </s>
<s> can t seem to decide between the dual core xeons eg 5150 or the core 2 duos eg e6700 </s>
<s> seems like the xeon is built more for a server and the c2d for a home machine work machine gaming machine to run graphics </s>
<s> i can say that we do run similar programs on dedicated servers </s>
<s> not that i won t run a game here or there on the workstation i have seen a few internet threads on this but still having a tough time deciding </s>
<s> xeon motherboards typically support multiple cpus and require ecc ram </s>
<s> not building it this will be from the factory and ram will be installed </s>
<s> perhaps one advantage of the xeon is that i can always add another processor later on </s>
<s> i also understand that equal clock speed doesn t necessarily mean equal real life speed </s>
<s> benchnarks for almost identical xeon and c2d processors show marked differences in programs such as photoshop </s>
<s> new xeons and core2duo are based on the same architecture and will perform almost the same with the same clock speed and cache size </s>
<s> here are benchmarks which show the xeon 5000 series and core2duo are neck and neck with most apps like photoshop desktop boxes usually offer faster ram than workstations because of the added cost of ecc ram </s>
<s> ddr2 800 is the fastest ecc ram available but ddr2 1066 and higher is available in non ecc form </s>
