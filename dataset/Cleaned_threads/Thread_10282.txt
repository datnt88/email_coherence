<s> hello so basically i put together a computer and it just refuses to post </s>
<s> i ve cleared the cmos via pin taken out the battery </s>
<s> the bios speaker makes a small faint clicking noise about every 800 ms almost 1sec i m using an amd athlon ii x3 3 3 ghz psu is fine i ve tested it in another pc works fine 550 wat psu graphics card is fine gtx 460 i ve tested it in another pc </s>
<s> cpu is fine tested it in another pc i tried my memory from another pc to this one the memory has lights and the lights always flash when i boot my pc but they stayed solid with pc that didn t post </s>
<s> it still clicks with the cpu out or in same with memory i ve reseated the cpu 3 4 times no bent pins looks fine and the cpu even gets hot when it s in i also checked the connectors on the heatsink fan to the mobo fine too </s>
<s> i ve unplugged all devices like keyboard mouse etc but still clicks </s>
<s> i fear the worst the motherboard </s>
<s> here s the mobo </s>
<s> does this have a monster power supply with a single rail 12v </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no dual rail with 60a on the dual 12v rails </s>
<s> place the motherboard on a cardboard square and try building the basic pc there </s>
<s> no video card is required to power up so if the psu motherboard won t power up there then you are looking at the bad parts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i think it s the motherboard </s>
<s> on a cardboard box with nothing but the psu cpu mem cpu fan it clicks still </s>
<s> usually when i take out the the cpu it would turn off it doesn t doesn t when i put it in either </s>
<s> i wiggle in around with a crapload of pressure and it turns off so i m thinking mobo issue </s>
<s> the pins on the cpu are absolutely straight i just got the cpu in the mail today </s>
<s> yep it was the motherboard </s>
<s> i took off the cpu socket cover and there were like 3 bent pin contacts </s>
<s> i d rather not risk putting them back in place to bend the cpu pins so i m gonna get a new mobo </s>
<s> thanks for the help guys </s>
<s> i find the cardboard out of the case test to be helpful at times </s>
<s> not a good result but helpful to narrow it down </s>
<s> bob </s>
