<s> hello i have no idea if this is in the right forum or not so please don t complain about it </s>
<s> anyway when ever i put in a black dvd r into my dvd drive burner it switches to a cd drive </s>
<s> i have tried enabling recording and switching the registry drive numbers from 1 to 2 as said on ms s website </s>
<s> i also tried uninstalling it and restarting letting windows configure it itself </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i am running windows xp media 2005 latest updates from windows update service </s>
<s> that s not a sign of any issue </s>
<s> xp does not know about dvd recording so there s nothing to fix here </s>
<s> bob </s>

<s> well could you recommend an app that does it for free and efficiently </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
