<s> ive been reading about people saying that you need a sata adapter and all kinds of cables in order to run a sata hard drive any input would be greatly appreciated thanks </s>

<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> so why do i see people talking about getting a sata adapter </s>
<s> i dont understand why you would need a sata adapter what is the use of one of these </s>
<s> and also what are the cons to having a sata hdd compared to the old ide hdd s </s>
<s> as vapcmd said you don t need on that board because it s new </s>
<s> people with older boards may need adaptors for the sata power connector or a pci sata card if they don t have onboard sata connectors </s>
<s> there are no con s to sata hdd s they are faster </s>
<s> older systems may need sata drivers on floppy disk to install xp </s>
<s> your board sata can be set in bios to ide mode so you don t need to worry about the driver for xp </s>
