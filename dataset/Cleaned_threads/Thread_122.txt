<s> i ve had 3 different hp reps try to help </s>
<s> many hours later they sent me another printer </s>
<s> same problem </s>
<s> computer displays quot printing quot printer displays quot printing quot but nothing happens </s>
<s> early on i was able to get one word doc to print but then it went back to the quot ghost quot printing or error </s>
<s> i have uninstalled my other two printers and scanner so the hp can be the only one </s>
<s> i ve also tried installing the hp with the driver from their website </s>
<s> still nothing </s>
<s> the printer will print the demo page by depressing the button on the printer </s>
<s> if i don t get a resolution by monday i ll be returning both printers and find another brand of color laser jet printer </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i need good color copies for pattern covers </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i am also experiencing the same prob </s>
<s> however i must state my prob is to do with vista as i have another pc on xp sp2 </s>
<s> it is working perfectly </s>
<s> my prob is that on the vista machine the driver keepds disappearing </s>
<s> i have loaded several times from the disk that came with the machine </s>
<s> on some occasions it will load okay and i can print without a prob </s>
<s> once i switch the machine off and on again and try printing the drivers would have disappeared </s>
<s> on some occassions the drivers just wont load </s>
<s> the following error message comes up quot an error has been encountered quot no specifics no error codes </s>
<s> have contacted hp by email just the auto reply promising that a technician would contact me </s>
<s> that was 3 mnths back </s>

<s> rick </s>
<s> hi rick thanx for your reply and sorry for the delay in responding </s>
<s> the solution you suggested has not borne any fruit </s>
<s> in fact i ve done that donkey times </s>
<s> everything runs until quot detected new printer </s>
<s> please wat quot it freezes there </s>
<s> the hp website suggests in that case pulling out the usb cable and back again </s>
<s> it responds to the usb then the message quot installation operation failed quot </s>
<s> at times i go thru the process you suggested and it works </s>
<s> most tho especially when i really need the printer it fails </s>
<s> don t know what to do now </s>
<s> run the windows cleanup utility </s>
<s> it will completely remove the printer from your computer </s>
<s> first make a system restore point </s>
<s> in case you accidentally click on something wrong you can always come back to what you already have </s>
<s> download and run the windows cleanup utility </s>
<s> only select the printer </s>
<s> after you re done retsrat your computer </s>
<s> now try installing the latest drivers </s>
