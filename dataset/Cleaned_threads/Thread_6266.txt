<s> yesterday it was working perfectly i was copying stuff back and forth i bought a new vaio vgn fj170 xp home and setting up the new machine transferring all my data </s>
<s> turn on turn off when not needed everything was perfect today my laptop can t seem to find the seagate anymore a device manager doesn t show any problems with any ports b i unplugged the firewire and connected through usb same results after a while of the mouse quot hour glassing quot it flashed a brief message quot your external drive may have propblems c unplugged and plugged into my old machine vaio too winme and now i got really scared as the my old machine couldn t locate the drive either </s>
<s> d unplugged everything again rebooted etc all the hoopla in various combintations and sequences same result </s>
<s> e finally placed a call to seagate a rep asked me to try the device manager again and concluded that the quot what his name quot chip is probably dead </s>
<s> and suggested one of the 2 options option1 call the data recovery dept which would charge an arm and leg to recover or option2 try the warranty dept </s>
<s> my luck with the help of mr murphy has it that as i found in my receipts i bought the seagate 300gb on jan 08 2005 exactly 1 year and 3 days ago so given that and given the priceless value of the data and years of work on the disk what do i do </s>
<s> q1 is there anyway to replace or jerry rig the chip even if only to get my data out </s>
<s> q2 alternatively is it feasible to try to just take the disk out and put it in a different enclosure or adapter to make it readible </s>
<s> q3 it gave me a whole new perspective re a strategy to backup my files in the future what do you gurus do </s>
<s> how do you make sure you never lose your stuff do i have to buy 2 3 separate drives and keep 3 copies of the same files </s>
<s> do i regularly backup my files on several dvd rws </s>
<s> oh yeah when i turn on the seagate it lights up normally as if it s ok the blue light and everything quietly hums so it doesn t look or feel or smell like somethig major happened inside is there anyone that i call and ask for an advice among you guys and gurus not the customer support as they were pretty useless </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> while figuring out how to recover my data from the dead drive what is the best way to keep my current backed up </s>
<s> otgher than burning several dvd rw s </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> nomadent </s>
<s> can you tell if it s spinning up </s>
<s> it might work if you put it another external enclousre or you cold pull the external case apart remove the hard drive and add it as a second hard disk drive in any system you can not as the boot drive and see if you can get the data off to another hdd </s>
<s> you ll probably have to connect it to an up to date system with all the patches so you ll get access to the entire 300gbs </s>
<s> better think about another way to backup your stuff externals are decent for a backup but a real no no for your only copy of your data </s>
<s> i ve got mine on drive 0 partition 2 drive 1 partition 2 and an external hdd </s>
<s> let us know </s>
<s> ok update bought an enclosure at compusa disassembled my seagate drive the drive is ok but the quot middle man quot chip bruned out as i was told by s customer service put in the drive in the new enclosure plugged in xp can t auto install or update the drive it recognizes a quot storage device is plugged in quot but doesn t go beyond that what do i do </s>
<s> heeeelp </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> which enclosure did you get </s>
<s> how was the hdd jumpered </s>
<s> not all enclosures are equal but most today should let your system see a 300gb usb external drive </s>
<s> was the drive visible under control panel admin tools computer management disk management </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> thanks for your help i got the compusa usb 2 0 3 5 inch enclosure the house brand for 29 99 </s>
<s> everything snaps and fits well after several attempts when i finally gave up and unplugged the drive in the new ecnlosure it was very hot don t know if it s normal or not my main goal is to get my data out when failing to detect i followed the prompt went to device manager and clicked the universal serial bus controllers it shows a quot usb mass sotrage device quot with a yellow quot exclamation point quot double click message quot can t start the device quot click troubleshoot it says quot code 10 quot disassembled everything put the drive back into the seagate case hoping some miracle happened plugged in power s on seems like something is humming soft vibration to the touch but i don t think it s the hard disk spinning that s about it not a single hit that my laptop is seeing it note from the seagate box unlike the compusa enclosure it is connected to the computer via firewire but i don t think it s the problem i d love to buy you dinner if you help me out hehe thanks anyway </s>
<s> system as a secondary drive </s>
<s> then you eliminate the external enclosure the usb cable and the system usb ports </s>
<s> note the system will have to be fairly new with xp sp2 or win2k with sp4 to recognize any hdd over 137gbs </s>
<s> let us know how it turns out </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
