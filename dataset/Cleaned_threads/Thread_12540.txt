<s> ok boys and girls i have a few questions </s>
<s> i have a dimension 4700 and i m thinking about a few upgrades </s>
<s> first i ll tell you what and how i have it running </s>
<s> here are my specs 4700 ram 2 x 512 433mhz ddr2 interrogated video intel pentium iv 3 4 ht 140 gb hd running vista enterprise same as ultimate minus media center i tried to max it out as best as possible when i bought it </s>
<s> now as to what i want to put in it </s>
<s> i m planning on adding 2 extra gigs of ram 2 x 1gb </s>
<s> here is the url for the product </s>
<s> now i don t think i will have a problem </s>
<s> they match specs with the exception that this runs at 533 and the ram in the system is running at 400 something </s>
<s> from what i understand it ll just run at the slower speed right </s>
<s> now a graphics card is needed </s>
<s> this is the one i had in mind </s>
<s> again i have the pcie card so there shouldn t be a problem </s>
<s> my only concern is my 305watt power supply </s>
<s> i don t use all the features with the computer all 6 usb ports and things like that so i m not too worried </s>
<s> so at the end i m hoping to have these specs dell 4700 ram 3 gb 2 x 1 gig and 2 x 512 video geforce 7600gs 256 mb pentium iv 3 4 does that sound like a mean system or what </s>
<s> what you you all think </s>
<s> will i have issues with those parts </s>
<s> anything i should know </s>
<s> should i pull out the 512mb ram cards and leave it with 2 x 1gb or will it be fine with all four dimms taken </s>
<s> thanks for all the advice </s>
<s> jf </s>
<s> your ram choice is fine as long it supports ddr2 533 but you need to determine what your current ram is running at </s>
<s> cpu z can figure it out for you </s>
<s> the dell comes with ddr2 400 or ddr2 533 not ddr2 433 which doesn t exist </s>
<s> personally if you re running ddr2 400 i d dump the existing ram and use all ddr2 533 </s>
<s> as for the graphics card what do you plan to use the pc for </s>
<s> the 7600gs is an entry level 3d card can play some games and will work fine with your 300w power supply </s>
<s> this evga 7600gs is a better buy at 85 before 20 rebate </s>
<s> if you don t plan on playing an games and don t like rebates this evga 7300gt is 66 straight up </s>
<s> get what your mobo support </s>
<s> some memory can be touchy </s>
<s> you can buy 433mhz ddr2 in 1gb sticks </s>
<s> good choice to max it out </s>
<s> your video card choice is also a good upgrade especially at 256 some will argue for ati </s>
<s> consider a good replacement p s if the dell shows any age wear but their supplies are better than the watts shown </s>
<s> but a really good supply is a positive upgrade to consider </s>
<s> past that a new mobo and a core duo would be next and what you buy now will be usable </s>
<s> i m pretty sure it s ddr2 400 </s>
<s> i bought it over two years ago </s>
<s> as for what i use the pc for i usually use it for school work and some games </s>
<s> i used to play america s army before it got too intense for the integrated video </s>
<s> same thing with war rock </s>
<s> i m really looking for something that i can play some games and have enough </s>
<s> oh and get out of vista basic hell </s>
<s> i have a laptop that has a geforce 6150 that has actually made it like night and day when switching back and forth </s>
<s> so i m hoping a 7600 will be even better </s>
<s> dell dimension 4700 crucial com says </s>
<s> evga cards are good overclockers so you can get more performance easily if you wish </s>
<s> this evga 7600gt is another option for 110 before 20 rebate </s>
<s> a 350w power supply is recommended but i ve seen folks use in dells without any issue </s>
<s> anything faster than a 7600gt will require a new power supply though </s>
