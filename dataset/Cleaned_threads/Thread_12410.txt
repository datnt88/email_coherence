<s> i have a brand new lenovo 3000 c100 laptop with wireless networking hooked up and stuff but i ve been having problems with it </s>
<s> i can connect to the internet for like five minutes at a time and then the wireless radio just shuts off by itself </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> will shut down the wireless while running on batteries if there is no activity </s>
<s> right click my computer click properties click the hardware tab click device manager </s>
<s> find your wireless card it ll probably be under network connections </s>
<s> right click it go to properties </s>
<s> go to the advanced tab i m pretty sure the one with all the options and enable cam constantly awake mode </s>
