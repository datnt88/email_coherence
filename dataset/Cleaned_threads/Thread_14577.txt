<s> i am looking for an old gateway 2000 desktop computer preferrably with windows 98 must have a telepath ii 14 400 modem and the faxworks program that came with the computer </s>
<s> doesn t have to look great just run so i can replay some old sentimental voicemails of a deceased family member </s>
<s> for what it s worth the one i had was a pentium 75 with about 64mbs of ram and a 720 mb hard drive </s>
<s> doesn t have to match those numbers necessarily </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i need to wonder why you need a computer to play old voicemail messages </s>
<s> if you have them stored on some media it would seem there could be other options </s>
<s> well i would ve thought so too since they are simple voice recordings but so far i cannot find anything to play or convert the files that is my end goal to convert the files to mp3 so they can copied onto a cd amp played in any cd player </s>
<s> i have limited knowledge of such things but done a fair amount of research and can t seem to find another solution </s>
<s> at this point it seems easiest to try amp go back to the original setup with windows 98 and faxworks </s>
<s> i have the files on cd along with an installed version of faxworks and also on my hard drive </s>
<s> each vmf file has a sister ctl file </s>
<s> two files with the same name just different file extensions </s>
<s> thanks for your interest </s>
<s> and were answered by one of the most knowledgeable people here </s>
<s> his advice was to do as you are asking here </s>
<s> about all i can find is a suggestion that something called quot iwave media player quot can handle that format </s>
<s> it also seems that the extension isn t unique to the voice mail program mentioned </s>
<s> i ve found plenty of hits using google to search for converter programs for that format but none seem like solid leads </s>
<s> my guess is that you may have already explored many of these sites already </s>
<s> i don t think i can offer much help here but thought knowing the file format might be useful </s>
<s> good luck in your efforts anyway </s>
<s> do you have any leads on this iwave media player </s>
<s> i think tried searching for that too to no avail </s>
<s> it seems like a lot of hits on google lead to nonexistant websites or have changed since the introduction of the inet wave player </s>
<s> however someone somewhere should have an archive of such things i would think they we we use data storage and archives </s>
<s> thanks again for your interest </s>
<s> if you come accross anything that will help please keep me in mind </s>
<s> p s </s>
<s> i think it was suggested to try a google s virtual machine or virtual box </s>
<s> or something to that effect </s>
<s> is this something you d agree could work </s>
<s> i just bought a computer from a gentleman that lied to me he said it was 8 years old but it is older and a 2000 because i found stuff on it that was from 2000 not 2004 would you be interested </s>
<s> it is a dial up computer remember those </s>
<s> my email is gingoss comcast net please let me know </s>
<s> i may be interested if it has the right hardware software </s>
