<s> well having just replaced a chipset cooling fan i wonder if there have been enough hours 2 years daily use that i should replace the cpu fan or does one just wait til one hears noise </s>
<s> fj </s>
<s> sleeve bearing units seem to last about year here </s>
<s> i had this old dual pentium pro that is now some 10 years old and it has intel s supplied ball bearing fans and it s just fine with no sign i ll replace those </s>
<s> my answer is from one year to never </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> a really dusty pc with heavy buildup on the blades will shorten the fan s life </s>
<s> unlike any other fan you may encounter and in a small form they do a good job even if cheaply made </s>
<s> for the most part having gotten 2yrs </s>
<s> out of one is pretty good </s>
<s> i clean and quot re oil quot if applicable as some have a top lock that gets loose or simply wears out and thus the bearing don t maintain well </s>
<s> these are cheap fans and those that are maganetically driven are more apt to cope </s>
<s> all in all these fans work best when cleaned blowout and brushed off </s>
<s> uneven wieght can destory a good fan </s>
<s> for the cost of replacement just keep an eye on them </s>
<s> of course quality matters </s>
<s> if you can mount a larger fan with adapter for better coling and fan upkeep </s>
<s> the larger the fan the slower it has to rpm for keep the same level of cooling </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
