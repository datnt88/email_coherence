<s> buddy brought in this old pc to look at every time i power on it posts fine then win98 splash screen then it reboots </s>
<s> over and over </s>
<s> cleared cmos reset frequency multiplier same symptoms </s>
<s> removed audio card floppy drive and all but one stick of ram same symptoms </s>
<s> attempted to boot gparted live cd </s>
<s> went to selection screen i chose failsafe mode it rebooted </s>
<s> then tried memtest86 memtest worked fine attempted to boot ubcd went to selection screen but after choosing any of the tests it rebooted </s>
<s> cpu temps are fine during pc health in bios not sure what s wrong </s>
<s> some specs abit be6 ii mobo award bios pci pnp 686 270620240 intel pentium iii 300e mhz slot 1 512 mb ram all three sticks in total ati 66702 xpert 98 rage xl 8mb sdram 2x agp powerman 235w psu fsp235 60gt any suggestions </s>
<s> since windows 98 boots that s a good sign </s>
<s> 98 rebooting could mean you need to install it again </s>
<s> many have forgotten how i won t tell either but you find these machines are often dumped because people have forgotten how to install the os </s>
<s> why i don t tell is it s all for the taking on the net </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> in such cases i review the specs of the mtrbd </s>
<s> and or system so at least the quot cockpit quot is alright </s>
<s> i make sure what s plug in and or present is working on another system as in quot test bed quot </s>
<s> thus i try to eliminate any possible sources of problems </s>
<s> because of the reboot i would swap out the psu for a known good one </s>
<s> alas due to wear tear to include age you can t trust anything </s>
<s> since this is a win98 based system disconnect the hd and cd if present and note that in the bios </s>
<s> now if in the bios doesn t it remain up and running there like walk away for 10min </s>
<s> is it still working for some input </s>
<s> if yes then provided a fd is connected use a bootable floppy and what are the results </s>
<s> if it reboots you have either a cpu or mtrbd </s>
<s> problem if the psu has been replaced </s>
<s> otherwise if original psu that maybe at fault </s>
<s> no telling what could be happening here </s>
<s> i have found real mice dropping etc </s>
<s> that have corroded lands and or eaten wires etc so a close inspection is warranted </s>
<s> a bad capacitor cap can be bad as in anywhere in the system so don t discount that </s>
<s> further what was the reason that system was put away </s>
<s> if it had some problem beforehand you re revisiting it </s>
<s> last hopefully if the system remains up and running during bios look see be sure the battery itself is good </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
