<s> external hdd flash drives which are bus powered </s>
<s> between ms office documents music collection and pictures i have finally gotten to 2 3 full on my original hdd and want to add on another sata drive in the 160 250gb range </s>
<s> my question do i need a new power supply </s>
<s> if so what do you recommend </s>
<s> is there some formula i could use to calculate my needs </s>
<s> it is a dell so i also have concerns about proprietary equipment dimensions cabling etc </s>
<s> also does anyone have any successes with any hard drive makers </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> hd their all good untill they die and you have no quot backup quot </s>
<s> the dell psus are darn good though many think they re not </s>
<s> the point is they do deliver the juice until it fails like any other psu </s>
<s> i suggest you calculate your actual power demands and add on top of that at least 50 or simply double it </s>
<s> because you have a dell you do need to be sure it is compatible to physically as well deliver the added wattage in its space </s>
<s> you can check at and follow their lead on suggestions </s>
<s> if price affects you then find what they offer in wattage and then look for another namebrand psu of similar rating </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> just leave your original power supply alone </s>
<s> it s more than adequate for your usage </s>
<s> as for hard drives any name brand will do western digital seagate hitachi </s>
<s> i d only get a maxtor since they re a subsidiary of seagate now if it was cheaper than the other brands i mentioned </s>
<s> sorry for the delay thanks to all the advice </s>
<s> i kept the current ps might swap out hard drives but everything seems to be working fine </s>
<s> good thing u kept the old psu b c dell has there psus specially made for there mobos so even if u did try and get anotehr one it wouldnt work believe me thats how my old pc was lol </s>
