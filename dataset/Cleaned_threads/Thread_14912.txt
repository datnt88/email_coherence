<s> hi i own a toshiba satellite 1135 s125 laptop and there are three usb ports on the computer </s>
<s> 2 are located on the back and 1 is located on the right side </s>
<s> i have been having difficulties with plugging hardware into them and my computer not acknowledging them </s>
<s> i m not the smartest when it comes to how to fix computers but my computer crashed a while back and my younger brother fixed it the best he could for me </s>
<s> it runs and i can open all of my programs and what not but the usb ports tend to not work </s>
<s> i can plug my mouse into any of the ports and restart my computer and it will work fine but if i unplug it and plug it back in it doesn t work again until i restart my computer </s>
<s> my mouse isn t my problem though it s my flash drive </s>
<s> i have a lexar 256mb flash drive and no matter what i do my computer does not acknowledge that i have plugged in my flash drive </s>
<s> the same thing happens when i plug in my mp3 player also </s>
<s> none of the led lights flash or come on and my mp3 library says that my quot creative player is not detected quot </s>
<s> i just bought my mp3 player yesterday and this was when i realized this problem </s>
<s> is there any way i can fix my usb ports so that i can plug and unplug any of my usb hardware and it will acknowledge it </s>
<s> please let me know what i have to do to fix this </s>
<s> thank you b hoffman </s>
<s> someone installed xp improperly or it took some heavy damage </s>
<s> it s time to find those restore cds and reload the machine </s>
<s> for most of us we never lose anything since we keep backups of what we can t lose </s>

<s> thanks i ll go talk to my brother about the cd s because i bought it from his old boss a while back and like i said earlier i m not to tech savvy when it comes to computers </s>
<s> i m sure the guy i bought it from will have the cd s somewhere </s>
<s> if not i ll get him to maybe try reinstalling xp on ym computer </s>
<s> thanks again b hoffman </s>
<s> reload the usb drivers either from the makers cd and or try their support website </s>
<s> laptop usb ports can fail and or proceed to have issues as power is an int </s>
<s> cause of such or flaky contacts </s>
<s> also be sure the usb ports are quot enabled quot under bios </s>
<s> if you have a lot of esd static this can cause problems and or blow out the usb ports </s>
<s> finally that same cause can render usb devices as well to fail </s>
<s> test elsewhere any such questionable devices </s>
<s> if push comes to shove then reload the os and start over from scratch just have the restore recovery cds or know what the vendor has provided in such cases like a hidden hd partition </s>
<s> of course back up any data before doing that last resort step </s>
<s> if after this and usb ports still remain quot iffy quot you have a true h w fault laptop repair </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
