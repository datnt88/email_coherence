<s> we had a lightning strike close by a few weeks ago and everything is plugged into a surge protector that shows it is working properly with no damaged </s>
<s> my printer has a constant buzzing when plugged in now i think it is shot </s>
<s> anyway since then my monitor works and my computer boots up but the mouse and keyboard were not working wireless and i could not log into my account in xp pro </s>
<s> i grabbed my son s wired mouse and keyboard to use for the computer and they don t work either </s>
<s> i have tried every usb port on the computer dell precision which has 2 in front and at least 6 in the back and they don t work as well </s>
<s> the mouse shows lit up on the bottom and the keyboard lights go on when i first plug it into the port but go off after 1 2 seconds </s>
<s> the usbs in the front give enough power that the external hard drive lights are on when computer goes on and the card reader light is on as well </s>
<s> can someone please help me and let me know what the problem is </s>
<s> i want the info off of the hard drive at the least but would like to have the desktop working </s>
<s> thanks in advance steven </s>
<s> if in fact lightening has done damage you can t discount any possible damage on anything </s>
<s> basically you really can t fix it and or a simple solution </s>
<s> you swap and or replace parts until it works </s>
<s> i suggest you remove the current hd as a safeguard </s>
<s> mount a spare or borrow hd and be sure it works </s>
<s> then do an install of the os and be sure all is well </s>
<s> if the usb ports don t work then bad mtrbd etc if not and it seems to work as in everything does what it supposedly does then mount the old hd and swap data over </s>
<s> hopefully you can continue from there if a new hd </s>
<s> if borrowed get a new hd and repeat process </s>
<s> otherwise think new system or another pc because by the time you fix it it maybe another new system anyways </s>
<s> i suggest the above as possible attempts at fixing the hd or in that direction may corrupt the data and you lose it </s>
<s> you can also mount the old hd in a ext </s>
<s> usb enclosure and using another pc get data and burn to discs </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> 1 does the surge protector have a warranty </s>
<s> mine has a replacement repair warranty on attached devices </s>
<s> 2 you stated the cpu boots but you have no control </s>
<s> hd works </s>
<s> the motherboard has a problem </s>
<s> 3 do you have a spare slot and can invest less than 20 </s>
<s> if so get or borrow a usb 2 0 card and see if that works </s>
<s> your system is booting psu video card and hard drive are working </s>
<s> it s the usb and serial ports that are out </s>
