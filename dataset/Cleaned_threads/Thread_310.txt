<s> had i settled for nothing else i would have settled for the layout for a gigabyte ga 6ex motherboard </s>
<s> i found the manual at the http site listed later </s>
<s> the pdf manual of 20 pages shows several figures however the figure for the motherboard is blank </s>
<s> i am trying to rebuild an older computer with the gigabyte mb and need help finding the graphical layout of the board </s>
<s> can anyone help </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i couldn t find anything for that board but i could give you some advice </s>
<s> normaly motherboard manufacturers tag thier ports inputs and pins on the board </s>
<s> with the manual you v it might take some time bt i am sure you could decipher it </s>
<s> also have you tried thier tech support </s>
<s> i found a similar board manual that i am fairly sure has the same pinouts for switches leds etc </s>
<s> however in the meantime i decided to go with a newer mb ps memory etc and not contend with the quot problems quot of the older board </s>
<s> thanks much for the input </s>
<s> gigabyte s web site was worthless and their email response </s>
<s> _ well i am still waiting </s>
<s> with that vintage series </s>
<s> they were actually proprietary mobos used in proprietary computers and poorly documented </s>
<s> found five varitations compared item location by item amd none acvtually matched </s>
<s> came the closest at the uk gigabyte site </s>
<s> the mobo had a dell stamp but no sign of it at dell </s>
<s> if you intend on using the ga 6ex to build a system it will be difficult if you do not have all the information </s>
<s> here is the information i got i am pretty sure you have the same </s>
<s> if you can get the original book manuel you will be lucky </s>
<s> but to get hardware for it will be hard it would be cheaper to get a barebone kit and start from there </s>
<s> here is a good barebone that you would not have to spend a lot just add cpu memory hard drive </s>
<s> good luck wendell h </s>
<s> barebone is the way to go the cheapest </s>
<s> this one is a lot faster than the other i mentioned earlier </s>
<s> enjoy what ever you make your mind up to do </s>
<s> good luck wendell h </s>
<s> thanks to all the above suggestions i now have a rebuilt computer but not using the gigabyte board </s>
<s> it took 2 attempts to get a board that would fit in the case and a couple of catalog goof ups with power supplies but the box is up and running </s>
<s> again thanks </s>
