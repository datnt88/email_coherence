<s> i recently did a fresh install of windows xp pro and threw in sp3 </s>
<s> when i go to update drivers for my 8800gtx my resolution and color drops from 1400x1050 32 bit down to 800x600 4 bit </s>
<s> i tried to increase the settings but it drops the setting back down on its own </s>
<s> i had to do a rollback to the previous drivers to fix the problem </s>
<s> is it the sp3 thats causing the issue or something else </s>
<s> the previous drivers that i m on right now came with the gfx card which is 2 years old and cant play any games with outdated drivers </s>
<s> i m thinking about just going back to sp2 </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> delete your display adapters in device manager before doing the install </s>
<s> after rebooting do not allow windows to reinstall the drivers </s>
<s> then install the latest nvidia drivers that should fix what ails you </s>
<s> omg there really is a holy cow </s>
<s> it worked </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> can you explained to me what happened </s>
<s> all of my previous driver updates i d just click to update without having to do what you told me </s>
<s> is it just a new procedure that i have to go through with sp3 </s>
<s> who knows </s>
<s> but if a device has become misconfigured the driver installation should be replaced not updated </s>
<s> deleting the device and preventing windows from reinstalling it usually lets you do a clean driver instation rather than updating the existing driver which is misconfigured </s>
