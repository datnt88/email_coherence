<s> i ve been troubleshooting a friend s computer on a wireless network but i have been perplexed by some strange difficulties </s>
<s> the wireless care detects the routers signal with signal strength around 60 </s>
<s> both the router and wireless card are netgear equipment and everything thing suggests that the connection should work fine but it doesn t </s>
<s> this particular network is open i e it has no security enabled and the wireless card s wireless assistant indicates there is no problem connecting however the assistant also indicates the assigned ip is nowhere near what it should be </s>
<s> the ip should be 192 168 0 3 however the ip it says was assigned is something like 169 254 0 20 ipconfig indicates that same ip </s>
<s> there are no other networks detected by the card and the signal strength is pretty steady </s>
<s> my friend has indicated that the connection worked fine last week </s>
<s> i already tried rebooting the router several times but that had no effect </s>
<s> i am puzzled is there something wrong with the wireless card or perhaps its driver or is it something else </s>
<s> oh and the computer is running on windows me </s>
<s> anyone have any helpful advice </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> is not valid for internet access </s>
<s> open winipcfg from start run and try releasing then renewing the ip for the network card in question </s>
<s> the underlying issue may be spyware viral in nature </s>
<s> if so try safe mode with networking and run the usual online scanners to clean off the machine </s>
<s> yeah my friend s machine would not renew the ip stating that it was unable to contact the dhcp server </s>
<s> this was over a wireless network card </s>
<s> i tried the same thing on the internal network card and it gave me an ip of 0 0 0 0 and would not renew the ip for the same reason as stated above </s>
<s> i think she has big problems any advice </s>
<s> you could try re installing the tcp ip protocol and microsoft client but that s not going to help if you have spyware or a virus </s>
<s> you could download stinger and it fits on a floppy since you don t seem to be able to get to the internet </s>
<s> does the computer have any antivirus software running </s>
<s> are the signatures current </s>
<s> any antispyware software </s>
<s> hi i have had similiar problem with my pc but mine is hard wired connecting with a netgear router i tried everything you can think of new nic replaced cables anti virus spyware scans in safe mode including re installing the op system xp pro and after 6 months and with help from other guys i gave up and tried a usb to rj45 adapter and i am online no problem all for the sake of 14 wished i had tried it earlier so i would recommend borrowing a wireless usb adapter first to try it </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> its esay to set up but no one is interested go here and user opinion at newegg </s>
<s> hi i tried posting a reply twice with no luck so hopefully this one is not duplicating my previous i have a netgear at home with three computers linked to it but recently i had to hook up a linksys to a friend computer so their laptop could operate wireless etc eytc i had a similair problem to yours and had to go to my internet page type in 192 168 1 1 and access the router home page from their i had to click on mac address clone not sure if this would be the same with netgear or not and noticed mac address was quot disabled quot once i enabled it all ip address problems were self corrected within seconds not sure if this will be the answer to yours but i certainly would look into it </s>
