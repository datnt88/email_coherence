<s> i am using a microsoft mn 500 router for my wireless network and it has worked fine up until we got dsl </s>
<s> i plugged the dsl into the router to get wireless internet </s>
<s> this worked for a couple of days then my range was shortened </s>
<s> i have the router downstairs and one of my computers up stairs it always ued to get very good signal and now it is low very low or no signal </s>
<s> i also get limited or no connectivity </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i m not sure if the dsl has anything to do with the problem </s>
<s> 1 first power cycle it all </s>
<s> 2 next a neighbor could have installed a wifi system and now you compete for quot air space quot try another wifi channel </s>
<s> i use 1 6 and 11 and see which has less interference </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you say this seems to have coincided with getting dsl </s>
<s> did your dsl provider give you one of those fancy new modems that has integral wireless </s>
<s> if so that may be the source of the interference that bob suggested might be coming from next door but only to find it wasn t next door after all it was right in your own place </s>
<s> then you need to figure out how to turn the wireless function off in the modem </s>
<s> otherwise back to the usual suspects </s>
<s> there is no reason for dsl vs cable by itself to affect wireless connectivity strength between the access point and the client </s>
<s> also check all the physical aspects perhaps an antenna or something got bumped loose or maybe it was set back down in a different position after messing with it connecting the dsl </s>
<s> or maybe somebody has suddenly developed a fondness for popcorn microwave ovens which share the 2 4ghz radio band are a big source of wifi interference dw </s>
<s> i live out inthe country fo there is not really any neighboring networks </s>
<s> my dsl modem doesnt have one of those wireless things built it </s>
<s> i just bought a d link di 524 router and an external antenna and that fixed my problem </s>
<s> the store recommended if i lost signal still to put a pie tin under the antenna </s>
<s> this helps to reflect the signal and act as a ground for the signal </s>
<s> once again thanks for your time </s>
<s> ar </s>
<s> update the firmware on the new d link router </s>
<s> even brand new ones often are out of date by the time they get through the distribution channel and off the shelf into the customer s home </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> i have now purchased a laptop witch connects to my wireless network along with my desktop pc witch also connects to my wireless network </s>
<s> now that i have my laptop the signal on the desktop and on the laptop is either low very low or quot wireless network connection 2 has limited or no connectivity quot </s>
<s> anyone got any help please </s>
<s> andrew </s>
<s> i see that option in the utility that it has </s>
<s> what is firmware and what does it do </s>
<s> i have the dl 524 and the firmware the software that it runs internally was updated just weeks ago </s>
<s> there is little to no chance yours has the latest version from dlink com gt and yes it works better now </s>
<s> it used to require a power cycle randomly from 5 days to 3 weeks </s>
<s> i was about to get an ups to see if it was some power issue but the new firmware since it was installed has made this box more of an appliance rather than something i have to check if there is a network glitch </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hardware equipment with chips and circuits </s>
<s> software programs and operating system instructions that are loaded temporarily into the memory chips of the hardware and then you can do what ever that set of instructions intends </s>
<s> firmware system instructions that are permanently loaded in hardware that tell it what to do </s>
<s> sort of like software in the hardware which is why they call it firmware </s>
<s> wetware one s brain </s>
<s> your s is getting wetter now firmware for the d link 524 can be downloaded from this link note that the page has explicit instructions to figure out which version of the 524 you have </s>
<s> your owner s manual has instructions on how to install the new firmware to the router </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> a wireless network has limited capacity </s>
<s> with only one user all the capacity is available </s>
<s> when more systems connect the capacity is shared and each gets less </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> when i update the firmware all of my network stettings will stay the same right </s>
<s> what exactly is a power cycle in a router </s>
<s> turn the power off wait and then turn it on </s>
<s> my settings were not saved </s>
<s> i used my cheat sheet to set it back up </s>
<s> about 1 minute of work </s>
