<s> after upgrading your hard drives do you reuse your old ones granted that it is in proper working order </s>
<s> why or why not </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> for what </s>
<s> do you ever fear it will fail on you </s>
<s> sometimes </s>
<s> when </s>
<s> it depends </s>
<s> on what </s>
<s> never </s>
<s> why not </s>
<s> first i use laptops </s>
<s> i don t even own a desktop pc </s>
<s> second i just don t have that much data to store </s>
<s> about the only data i keep are photos </s>
<s> i burn them to a dvd </s>
<s> they are much easier to store and use </s>
<s> i could use an old hard drive as an external drive but i don t even use the portable external hard drive i already have </s>
<s> yes i do reuse hard drives </s>
<s> to experiment like with windows 8 pre release version and for temporary storage </s>
<s> temporary because all hard drives will eventually fail </s>
<s> i do not replace a drive until it quits </s>
<s> and hopefully i have recently backed it up </s>
<s> boo rah </s>
<s> i use old hard drives as paper weights well on second thought i do keep them around because i work on computers for a living </s>
<s> i just had a machine the other day that the customer wanted windows 7 put on it and it was an old dell that was previously running xp home </s>
<s> the hard drive that was on it was rather small but still big enough to support windows 7 but not much more </s>
<s> we re talking about parallel drives here folks so i added a second drive to give them some more storage </s>
<s> mobo didn t support serial so even if i wanted to go out to buy one it wouldn t work in this particular system </s>
<s> so if you work on systems they have a use </s>
<s> but if you don t work on systems for a living then you might as well get rid of them </s>
<s> it also depends on how big the hard drives are </s>
<s> if it s a small one i m probably just going to write it to zeros to protect my customers data and throw it in the garbage </s>
<s> but if it s a big one it doesn t hurt to keep it around in case you might need it </s>
<s> yes sure why not it works and there s always some pc that needs a different and better drive </s>
<s> sometimes if the need is there why not and it s a known working drive quot good to go quot </s>
<s> it depends it always depends on need cost and availability not to mention its already in hand </s>
<s> never can t say never unless its too old or weak on capacity </s>
<s> i make it a point to toss 20gb or less </s>
<s> however if its broken rarely does it make past the recycle bin </s>
<s> but its not like i do this every day or even monthly maybe 3 4 a yr heck there are 3tb drives out there </s>
<s> if i have a 500gb and i used it for 2yrs then looking at an affordable 3tb is inviting </s>
<s> it s been my experience that a good drive will last at least 5yrs </s>
<s> or more </s>
<s> however if a drive pukes at 3yrs </s>
<s> or less its not worthwhile to save other than data and hope the warranty is still there </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> yes i reuse drive but only because i have an os and applications image stored on an external drive </s>
<s> i m frugal to the extent that i ll squeeze the last bit of life out of any drive </s>
<s> current drive capacities are such that storage space isn t really a worry </s>
<s> smart testing and other disk checks provide warning of impending failure </s>
<s> no specific reason to ditch an old drive before it shows signs of stress </s>
<s> several years ago i saw it mathematically demonstrated that the drive had to written over for at least 3 times to ensure that nobody could retrieve the data </s>
<s> now since some cd s are 3 dimensional the 3 time write over supposedly doesn t work </s>
<s> at a business show a few months ago some guys were selling a quot drive shredder quot that actually chops up the drive into tiny metal and plastic pieces that resembles the way a paper shredder works </s>
<s> how important is your data </s>
<s> how paranoid are you </s>
<s> do you think a hammer and saw could accomplish the same thing </s>
<s> i am using an acer aspire desktop last one til they started making laptops only and it is loaded </s>
<s> but i keep my old hp brand xp with upgrade for some of my games that do not trade up easily </s>
<s> my acer aspire is running on windows 7 and i had to do some fancy footware to get it to go on some of the games written for much simpler machines </s>
<s> so some things i doubt would go to windows 8 therefore the xp is still on board </s>
<s> i can save other stuff like family pictures on it as well </s>
<s> who prints pictures </s>
<s> my addresses for email are on it as well </s>
<s> some are changed but the really old ones are still somewhat useful </s>
<s> there are just enough things that just don t transfer from machine to machine like the pinball machine </s>
<s> i love it but it won t transfer out of hp xp to the aspire </s>
<s> darn </s>
<s> once replaced the 4gb hard drive with a 32 kept the old one just the way it came out the self installed os did miss some tricks which the manufacturer had included and i was glad to swap back to the old drive for os swapfile and most used software installed remaining software and copied all files to the large drive </s>
<s> regularly sort saved items and transfer all i want to keep to external hd thus built in hd remains spacious enough to hold installed software and current files </s>
<s> and this way there is an external back up in case notebook goes awol </s>
<s> re using the old hd is likely more an enthusiast thing where people replace a 500gb drive with a 750 or a 5400rpm with 7200 as an aside for me speed really increased when adding ram not when upgrading the hd </s>
<s> also ensure better cooling of notebook i e </s>
<s> not using it on a warm lap as that way the thermal envelope is less likely to be reached meaning the cpu and hd slow down when reaching around 50c to avoid overheating on my desk the surrounds are 20c on my lap 35c </s>
<s> it s the main cause of slow computer when room temperature reaches 30c </s>
<s> but i digress </s>
<s> time to make jewelry and recover some really neat magnets to play with from the hdd case </s>
