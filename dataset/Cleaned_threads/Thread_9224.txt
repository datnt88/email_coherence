<s> this is an annoying problem that has recently started to happen in our office </s>
<s> the umax powerlook ii scanner is taking half a day to power up </s>
<s> that s 3 hours and it greatly impacts on our work flow </s>
<s> below are the specs of the computer and the adaptec scsi card </s>
<s> computer specs os name </s>
<s> am assuming that you have tried reloading the scanner software </s>
<s> other peripherals work normally </s>
<s> printer etc </s>
<s> if you have not uninstall the scanner and reinstall the software </s>
<s> sounds more like a hardware issue but always try the software first then go from there </s>
<s> yes we have tried that </s>
<s> but the software doesn t work when the hardware isn t detected when the computer starts </s>
<s> when the computer starts the scanner isn t even detected in the device manager </s>
<s> before last week if i hit refresh the scanner was detected and started but now nothing happens </s>
<s> sounds like hardware issue then </s>
<s> cable possibly but more than likely internal issue with scanner </s>
<s> my suggestion would be to replace it with a newer usb input scanner they aren t that expensive and are generally faster than the old scsi hook ups </s>
<s> it does seem to be a hardware issue because it s taking half a day from the time the power button is pushed </s>
<s> this is even before i turn on the computer </s>
<s> in regard to your second point getting the usb scanner might be like pulling teeth as far as my supervisor is concerned </s>
