<s> i decided from some reason to upgrade my firmware on my light on dvdrw shm 165h6s </s>
<s> i went to light on s site and found the only firmware version there </s>
<s> downloaded and installed just fine </s>
<s> no problems at all </s>
<s> it told me to re boot so i did </s>
<s> now after i reboot windows xp pro says it found new hardware the light on drive that has been installed for over a year </s>
<s> i tried both options to let windows find the driver or me specify the location </s>
<s> both ways windows doesn t find any driver </s>
<s> if i try to select a driver i get quot dvd cd rom drive filter quot it says this driver is not digitally signed </s>
<s> i still try to install it </s>
<s> after a couple of warnings that windows can t verify the driver then it asks for pxhelp20 sys file </s>
<s> i find it in my windows system32 drivers directory and install </s>
<s> then it finish and says quot there was a problem installing this hardware quot i end up doing the same thing again next time i reboot </s>
<s> any idea what i need to do </s>
<s> my only worry is that i plan to re install windows here in about two weeks </s>
<s> and i need this drive to work </s>
<s> my computer is a asus p800 deluxe p4 1gb of ram </s>
<s> driver or use a system restore for the same </s>
<s> why update the driver if the old one works ok </s>
<s> whenever the firmware on a dvd drive is updated the os will call it quot new hardware quot when you reboot </s>
<s> there should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update </s>
<s> there should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update </s>
<s> perhaps that s true for a dvd </s>
<s> what i ve seen with other hardware is the firmware update seems to change the device type id </s>
<s> when windows goes looking for a driver to match the type id there is no match </s>
<s> now it s back to the maker s site to find a driver that supports the new firmware </s>
<s> gt gt gt why update the driver if the old one works ok </s>
<s> usually to help boost performance some and so forth </s>
<s> gt gt gt gt there should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update </s>
<s> i agree that is what so surprising </s>
<s> also i have another older dvd burner that works just fine no driver problems </s>
<s> gt gt gt gt now it s back to the maker s site to find a driver that supports the new firmware </s>
<s> the site doesnt have any drivers for its cd dvd drives </s>
<s> as far as i have seen they want us to use the windows xp driver </s>
<s> i dont know if i have some newer driver that windows thinks it should install or what </s>
<s> i cant find the right inf file to get this to install properly </s>
<s> if you can reinstall your old driver </s>
<s> afterwards make sure all is working ok then reinstall the new driver </s>
<s> do not reboot </s>
<s> shut off the computer and unplug it </s>
<s> wait for about 15 seconds for the 5 volts to bleed down plud it back in and boot as normal </s>
<s> hope it helps </s>
<s> did you mean driver or firmware </s>
<s> i never changed the driver just for some reason windows xp can t seem to find the correct driver </s>
<s> for firmwware i actually wish i could go back to an old version but there aren t any listed on light on s site </s>
<s> only the version i currently have </s>
<s> i did find one on a different site i don t know how old it was but when i tried to install it it already knew i had the latest version </s>
<s> they are talking about the problem you have here also as you read down the list there is a post that says go here give it a try to see if that will fix the problem </s>
