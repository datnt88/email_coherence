<s> i need to get an ac adapter for my lcd monitor but i m having problems finding a compatible one </s>
<s> here s the specs for the original adapter that comes with the monitor input 100 240v 50 60hz output 12v 2 09a anyways my question is would i be able to use an adapter for a different peripheral if the output voltage and amps where higher than the original adapter </s>
<s> i ve been looking into universal notebook adapters that have variable output voltages from 15 to 24 volts and also higher amp output </s>
<s> would one of these adapters work or would the higher output cause damage </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the device needs the exact voltage specified but it will handle more current power amps </s>
<s> the circuitry will shunt the excess power but excess voltage will fry it </s>
<s> look at these from they re two listed in 12v 3a range </s>
<s> as for proper usage you do need the right voltage period the amps can be higher but lets not get crazy </s>
<s> i did mention those they seem to fit what you need and are new and cheap but verify the connection barrel type </s>
<s> part pwr1207 and pwr1206 good luck willy </s>
