<s> ok i whent out and got a 512mb chip for my computer compaq 4410us sdram 168 pin first i thought the chip was bad because after instaling it the computer only read 64mb and was slow as all hell </s>
<s> turns out each of the two slots in my computer can only support up to 256mb so i still only got 265mb in there and a 512mb chip i can use or return </s>
<s> my question is could placing this 512 chip in my computer have damaged it </s>
<s> if so where could i get it tested </s>
<s> i ment 512mb chip that i can t use </s>
<s> the chances it was damaged are probably very small </s>
<s> i don t know if there is any place that would test it for you </s>
<s> if you know someone with a pc that can use the memory willing to let you borrow the pc for a few hours to test the ram you could do it that way </s>
<s> to test ram get a program called memtest86 </s>
<s> available at i believe </s>
<s> it is free and you put it on a cd or floppy and the system boots directly into it and begins testing your ram </s>
<s> leave it running for at least a couple passes and a full pass might take awhile depending on the speed of the pc </s>
<s> if there are errors memtest86 will find them </s>
<s> you less than likely damaged your 512mb stick </s>
<s> usually with hp and compaq products their motherboards are made for a certain load of ram the older the computer the less upgradeable it is </s>
<s> in your case hp could have the motherboard in such a way that it can only use a maximum of say 512mb 2x256mb instead of 512mb 256mb therefore with a lot of the machines if you add ram above what the motherboard can handle only so much more will be taken advantage of </s>
<s> consequently it becomes a disfactor as it will slow down the machine </s>
<s> if you have 2 memory slots you could try 2x256mb and see how that works </s>
<s> if that doesnt work either you could always return the extra stick too </s>
<s> another thing you could do is call hp if you still have coverage and tell them you want to upgrade your ram </s>
<s> they will ask for your model etc and will tell you what the maximum ram is </s>
<s> cool i m going to end up selling it and buying a 256 chip </s>
<s> thats why i ask </s>
<s> ya my little rig is maxed at 512 2x256 but bc i got it from ubid com and it was my fault for getting the wrong one ill just keep it for now and sell it on ebay after i do what that one guy said test it in a friends computer </s>
<s> i was just a little freaked out bc with just the 512 chip in it ran show and only at 64mb </s>
<s> in my computer that is a 7 yr old gateway max sdram is 768 mb dimm </s>
<s> i checked it with this it shows i have 3 slots and non parity sdram pc133 in each one 256mb 128mb 128mb </s>
<s> that means i can replace the 2 128 with 2 256mb </s>
<s> the math checks for 256 times 3 768mb </s>
<s> it will tell you how much ram your computer supports what you have in there now </s>
<s> it also can be pc100 but they are outdated </s>
