<s> i have a quot d link quot cable router with 4 port </s>
<s> i have 2 pc s both xp home and an xbox </s>
<s> i ve had no problems for about 2 years until yesterday when an error message said quot cable not connected quot </s>
<s> same message on all 3 i checked all the cables and they worked fine when not using the router </s>
<s> i saw a reset button on the router nothing </s>
<s> what should i look at now </s>
<s> a new router </s>
<s> i m hoping someone has an idea </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> would be to go to the d link site </s>
<s> they have excellent support </s>
<s> you may have corrupted firmware and newer may be available </s>
<s> good luck click here to see the cnet faces learn a little about internet connections and data and download free software </s>
<s> suppose you were an idiot </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and suppose you were a member of congress </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but i repeat myself </s>
<s> mark twain </s>
<s> three devices at the same time would lead me to suspect a common source </s>
<s> swap the router </s>
