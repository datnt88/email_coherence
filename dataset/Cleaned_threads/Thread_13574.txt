<s> firstly i m not a network engineer just a volunteer but i ve done the majority of the hardware installation at this school </s>
<s> the current and growing need is for school parents guests presenters etc </s>
<s> to have access to the wireless network but without access to the lan </s>
<s> the network not a domain but simple peer to peer with device access controlled via firewalls and or user passwords </s>
<s> the best i can find on the web is the use of some vlan capability and think we might already have most of if not all the needed hardware </s>
<s> here s what we have eight 3com model crwe7760 75 aps connected to a 3com model 3cdsg10pwr managed switch </s>
<s> i have access to all these devices </s>
<s> this poe switch connects to one of 5 it has 24 active ports on a cisco layer 3 switch </s>
<s> that router is managed remotely and i ve no way to get to it </s>
<s> the aps can handle 4 ssids and have the ability to individually assign vlan ports to each </s>
<s> the poe switch has the ability to configure vlans for all ports </s>
<s> all that is desired is enable select aps in certain parts of the school to allow guest access to the internet only </s>
<s> if possible we d like to do this without purchasing new hardware at this time </s>
<s> i can tinker with it but for now i d like to know if this can be done without involving the cisco router </s>
<s> if the router is definitely and i suspect it might be a party to the plan we can contact the person who handles that end </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> since 3com is no more and hp rarely answered the question just forget it </s>
<s> if folk want the internet they ll bring their smart phone or personal wifi hot spot </s>

<s> and probably a better idea to wait until the current hardware and lack of trained it staff is no longer serving well </s>
<s> of course is always the barrier </s>
<s> i can t share the full details but the school would be blasted if they were able to get pron over the guest network </s>
<s> not a fun way to get de funded </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> all schools in the diocesan system route through a school which is home to a tightly managed firewall </s>
<s> teachers complain it s too tight as you can t even access youtube within the building </s>
<s> i m guessing that a proxy server is part of the control </s>
<s> it people at the server location also manage the router that s in the local school and they don t hand out admin passwords </s>
<s> as for allowing guest access i d be more concerned about losing bandwidth during times of peak need by students </s>
<s> leaching from the system after hours isn t a problem as because the aps are poe we can just flip a toggle to the switch dedicated to the wireless side </s>
<s> no one can sit in the parking lot and surf once the tech coordinator locks up and goes home </s>
<s> eventually as needs grow and a more complex system is needed they ll need a way to find money to hire or contract real it services but i m sure some jaws would drop at such a sales presentation </s>
