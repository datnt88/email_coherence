<s> hi all a colleague at my university is using an airport time capsule 1tb model a1355 to share files with his students wirelessly </s>
<s> the machines are running leopard 10 5 8 and it works well but it will only allow 20 wireless clients at a time </s>
<s> all the client machines log in with a password </s>
<s> when you remove one of the 20 another can log in </s>
<s> the tech specs on the apple website just say that it accepts wireless guest access and there is no mention of a 20 client limit </s>
<s> i looked right through airport utility and couldn t find where the number of wireless clients could be configured </s>
<s> does anybody know if this is the hard limit for the number of wireless clients for an airport time capsule 1tb model a1355 </s>
<s> if it is not a hard limit does anybody know how to change it </s>
<s> any help or advice would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> while you can call apple most access points have limits from 16 to 32 so this is right in there </s>
<s> besides wouldn t having that many on one access point be a great way to kill the speed </s>

<s> hi bob thanks for your reply </s>
<s> having that many clients access the drive to copy files off doesn t raise any speed issues but i can imagine it would if we were using it to share internet access </s>
<s> it seems fair enough to limit the number of clients to 16 to 32 unfortunately our classes average 25 so the 20 limit is a little annoying </s>
<s> a near miss </s>
<s> i ll contact apple directly and see if i can get to the bottom of the specs for the time capsule in question </s>
<s> i ll post the results for anyone else who finds this thread </s>
<s> thanks again for your help and interest </s>

<s> will be slow when more than a few are copying files </s>
<s> here s why </s>
<s> unlike a wired connection where a switched hub keeps the pipes full and you get as much as possible from the server to each machine wifi is shared air space so as each user is copying out it goes slower and slower at worse than one divided by the number of users copying out </s>
<s> for web browsing the use pattern is such that it s not as noticeable </s>
