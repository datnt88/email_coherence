<s> i have a freeagent pro 750gb hard drive </s>
<s> i want to use the esata interface but have seemed unable to thus far </s>
<s> i bought an esata cable that has 3gb s transfer speed along with an quot esata ii expresscard raid quot by siig inc i installed all the software for the card which appears in device manager and seems to be working properly and nothing seems to work </s>
<s> it doesn t show that i have a drive connected at all </s>
<s> it seems to work fine with usb but not with my esata connection </s>
<s> this is the secong kind of card i have tried so i don t know what else to do </s>
<s> i have a laptop that runs windows xp media center </s>
<s> what derails most is that you would think it should be as easy as installing one driver </s>
<s> sadly you often discover some motherboard drivers need installing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> with the drive electronics </s>
<s> not very likely however </s>
<s> anyway the shop where you bought it hope it s stone and brick should be able to show it works with them so isn t broken </s>
<s> that leaves the driver issue </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> i just purchased the exact same setup </s>
<s> siig expresscard esata with raid and the 500gb freeagentpro </s>
<s> one thing i found is that there is possible interference between the esata cable plug end and the siig card </s>
<s> i had to shave the corners off the cable plug end in order to get it to seat properly in the card </s>
<s> once that is fixed the blue light should appear on the siig card </s>
<s> for single drive mode you have set it up as a raid0 </s>
<s> be careful because the raid gui from siig will require you to format the drive after creating teh riad group </s>
<s> make sure you install backup the software that s preloaded on the drive </s>
<s> i lost mine that way no cd </s>
<s> i m still working on formatting the drive </s>
<s> doesn t seem to want to format while plugged into esata </s>
<s> let me know how it goes </s>
<s> i ve also got a 750gb freeagent pro but it s connected directly to an esata port on the motherboard s rear panel asus p5n e sli </s>
<s> i think that the connection is live because the external hdd stops starts glowing orange when i switch off boot up the pc </s>
<s> absolutely no sign of it anywhere in the pc though </s>
<s> nothing in device manager let alone my computer </s>
<s> i m running vista home premium </s>
<s> the drive worked fine when i connected it to my windows xp laptop using the usb cable </s>
<s> any ideas folks </s>
<s> i ll email seagate and ask them too </s>
<s> i ll let you know if they come up with anything useful </s>
<s> thanks very much </s>
<s> i bought a pci esata card and cable from fry s to connect to my 750 gb freeagent pro </s>
<s> the drive will not power on no light no matter what i tried </s>
<s> the card appears in the xp media center configuration </s>
<s> the base of the drive is warm but no orange light </s>
<s> usb and firewire work fine </s>
<s> i have a sony vaio desktop with xp media center edition </s>
<s> has anyone experience this problem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> had the same problem with mine </s>
<s> having done a bit of research it seems the esata connection on the drive is a bit problematic </s>
<s> i found that if i push the esata cable firmly into the socket it will work but as soon as i let go it does not </s>
<s> unfortunately i haven t found a solution yet i will be trying a new cable soon </s>
<s> other users have trimmed the plastic on the cable connector so it will go further into the socket i may try that as well </s>
<s> i have been looking for an answer to this exact problem </s>
<s> i have freeagent pro 320gb drive and haven t been able to get a sata connection working </s>
<s> like the rest here i could get a usb connection no trouble </s>
<s> i also purchased 2 different esata port pci cards and could not seem to get them working </s>
<s> i stumbled across this forum and saw that it was a cable connect problem for some of you </s>
<s> when i plugged my drive in the cable felt like it was connecting but after reading this post and apply some addtional pressure to my cable </s>
<s> bam it works </s>
<s> just wanted to say thanks </s>
<s> i had the same issues </s>
<s> i found that i just had to push the esata cable in harder into the drive and tada </s>
<s> it worked </s>
<s> i feel extremely stupid after this experience </s>
<s> i was checking my drivers bios connections to the mb swapping known good connections trying different cables stupid that it was that simple </s>
<s> i ve wasted money on two pci controllers the whole night looking up faqs knowledge databases bios and driver upgrades from wd silicon image and vantec and i was one stop short of rma ing my external hdd thankfully i found this forum </s>
<s> just a 60 second trick to shave the end off the header and it works </s>
<s> the thing is why can t they even get the specifications right in these sort of stuff </s>
