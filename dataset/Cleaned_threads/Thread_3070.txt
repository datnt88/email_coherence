<s> hi all currently i have a pc running windows xp that uploads automatically some files to my web server </s>
<s> i have problems whith electrical power </s>
<s> can i configure my pc to automatically start when power is back </s>
<s> can i do this whith a software or i need to set up smth in windows or bios </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> no make model or link to the machine s manual so i ll just write quot bios setting quot </s>
<s> as stated by robert you can reboot or once power is returned to system cause a reboot of that system </s>
<s> however because this is a power issue its far better to allow it to sit out until quot stable power quot is present </s>
<s> if the power is erratic or on off as it were repeated reboots start ups could corrupt the system </s>
<s> i suggest you have a more protected system as in stand by power line conditioner and surge protection in all or varied forms </s>
<s> having this will reduce any real or reduce damage to h w and or reduce some s w corruption or allow a proper shutdown at least </s>
<s> if your power problems are constant than this is your best way to help yourself </s>
<s> i offer this as the post you supplied provided little info </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> ups uninterruptible power supply or sometimes called a battery backup </s>
