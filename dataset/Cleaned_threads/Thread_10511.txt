<s> hi there i have a problem with my twinhead 12d and if you could tell me what might be the possible problem that is occurring to my twinhead </s>
<s> i have been using my twinhead for nearly 5 years and it has served me quite well </s>
<s> i m satisfied with my twinhead but now this problem is occuring i just can t accept it and it s making me sad knowing that i have to spend a few hundred bucks to repair it </s>
<s> what happened was i left on my twinhead for a day and when i came back from work i found out that my twinhead was swtiched off </s>
<s> the cooling pad s light which was attached through the usb cable was blinking though and the cooling pad was working fine </s>
<s> except for the laptop </s>
<s> i thought my laptop was shut off accidentally because of a power trip or something </s>
<s> so i decided to turn it back on </s>
<s> to my dismay it wouldn t turn on i checked all of my electrical appliances in my room everything was okay </s>
<s> i checked my modem and router too turned out they were okay </s>
<s> at that time i wasn t using any battery with my twinhead </s>
<s> i was just using the ac adapter connecting to the power socket then i tried using the battery without the charger it worked perfectly fine </s>
<s> it went to windows and i could use it like normal with no problem at all </s>
<s> but i tried it without the battery it didn t work </s>
<s> i tried the battery and the power charger the battery will not charge all all </s>
<s> i m not sure what might be the problem </s>
<s> is it my ac adapter or is it something inside the motherboard </s>
<s> i can t afford to buy a new twinhead motherboard </s>
<s> what had happened </s>
<s> when i charged it without the battery there s a small electric sound inside </s>
<s> an abnormal electric sound </s>
<s> please reply me asap </s>
<s> regards a </s>
<s> sounds like you will need a new power adapter here is the link to twinhead from there you ll be able to get a new adapter </s>
<s> the battery management and the circuits that control decide which power source to use are on the motherboard </s>
<s> 5 years is a very good lifespan for a laptop </s>
<s> not many go much longer </s>
<s> i wonder how many will learn this as most new pcs are now laptops </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have been using it for 5 years doesn t mean i have to change into a new laptop </s>
<s> like i said in my post when i used the battery everything will work perfectly fine </s>
<s> if it s the mobo i think i just have to change the mobo or repair the mobo at least </s>
<s> the backlight and more has aged and if you recall almost all consumer gear is a five year design life </s>
<s> you would be out all that for the motherboard only to eek out a few more months </s>
<s> then again many have to learn this first hand </s>
