<s> i have a samsung flatcrt monitor and occasionally i ll see orange lines going across the right side of the monitor </s>
<s> after about 15 seconds all the lines disappear </s>
<s> what s going on here </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> sounds like your tube is on the fritz time to get a new monitor </s>
<s> could be your video card have you been able to test it the monitor on another computer </s>
<s> describe symptoms color </s>
<s> deep orange kind of faded light rainbow organized </s>
<s> straight lines constant width size </s>
<s> disorganized </s>
<s> random dots segments waves </s>
<s> traveling </s>
<s> moving from where to where </s>
<s> if it s a light rainbow it could be a magnetic field from an electronic device deflecting electrons from the cathode ray gun unshielded speakers commonly cause this </s>
<s> however there needs to be a dynamic magnetic field for this to occur intermittently i e speaker power needs to be changing or speakers need to be moving </s>
<s> i suppose a dark orange but not too dark </s>
<s> they are straight lines that go from the farmost right side to about half way </s>
<s> i seem to notice them better when i open a window with a white background on the desktop </s>
<s> i just bought the monitor about half a year ago </s>
<s> i have an ati radeon 9600xt video card </s>
<s> i just downloaded the latest catalyst drivers </s>
<s> i haven t changed any settings besides the tv out configuration </s>
<s> are there any changes i can make to fix the problem </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i m using firefox web browser i noticed there s an orange line across the folder tab </s>
<s> i m not sure if it s always been there but that s the same orange color i see going across the screen sometimes </s>
<s> also i see the orange when i open my computer and hover over quot name quot quot type quot quot total size quot </s>
<s> i don t know if that s supposed to happen but that s what i see </s>
<s> hmmm it would be very informative to see if this phenomenon were repeated while connected to a different computer then you could confidently rule out your computer </s>
<s> the good thing is that the samsung monitors i have seen have a 3 year warranty </s>
<s> i d check into it </s>
<s> a shot in the dark 1 check monitor cable for kinks frays loose at jack or base of monitor </s>
<s> 2 check to see if there are any ati card diagnostics in catalyst or downloadable from mfg </s>
<s> seems like that orange underlining in my computer is standard on xp </s>
<s> same with firefox </s>
<s> so must be the monitor </s>
<s> but how it s pretty new </s>
<s> just to clarify are you saying that the orange lines appear on the monitor when connected to computer one and to computer two </s>
<s> if the orange appears while attached to each computer it is either the monitor s hardware or you need to install the latest driver from samsung com </s>
<s> try installing the latest driver </s>
<s> at no particular time </s>
<s> i ll try installing the latest drivers then </s>
