<s> first off apologies if this was already asked </s>
<s> i searched the forum but found no solution to my particular problem </s>
<s> i m having problems detecting my hard drive </s>
<s> now what i did got a new 160gig hd my slave d and installed it </s>
<s> i was able to format via admintools gt comp mgmt gt disk mgmt it and put some data onto it </s>
<s> i formatted and reinstalled winxp pro onto my master hd </s>
<s> both were formated as ntfs </s>
<s> no problem </s>
<s> now when i went to mycomputer my d didn t show up </s>
<s> i checked the jumpers the bios and device manager they all say the hd shows up is running okay </s>
<s> went back to the diskmgmt screen and the hd is innactive </s>
<s> right clicking on it prompts me to change it to a basic volume which would delete everything in order to use it which i obviously can t do since i have some data i need on it </s>
<s> what can i do to view the drive </s>
<s> for instance xp doens t support over 127gb drives until sp1 </s>
<s> this drives people to frantic states since many will install xp and such a drive will do as you wrote </s>
<s> next the drive if not partitioned with xp may indeed vanish </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you were right </s>
<s> the service pack upgrade was the issue </s>
<s> very much appreciated </s>
<s> chin </s>
<s> many lose the drive contents over that one </s>
<s> just asking </s>
<s> why didn t you tell you had reinstalled the os </s>
