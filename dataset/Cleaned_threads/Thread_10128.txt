<s> every time i restart my laptop a message pops up after i log in saying quot s m a r t has predicted that hard disk 0 may fail soon quot </s>
<s> is it ok to go ahead and clone this hd onto another </s>
<s> or could that cause any problems with a new hd </s>
<s> if your hard dive is making noise its going to fail soon i dont think a software can predict that except for the windows one </s>
<s> my question was if i close my system to a new hd would that possible cause any software os problems because of my old hd going bad </s>
<s> if the clone is successful then all your data will be moved to the new hd and be safe </s>
<s> if the clone is not successful then you wing it like maybe try to copy out your stuff </s>
<s> if the clone is successful and all your data is nice and safe then you can play with the orig hd maker s fitness test </s>
