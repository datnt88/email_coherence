<s> goto to dell and allow them to check your quot system status quot for an upgrade </s>
<s> more than likely you need an ide type hd </s>
<s> many are on sale or online starting in the 120gb or more range </s>
<s> it a real drop in upgrade and make sure it has the help guide with purchase or get online at the hd makers support website </s>
<s> go there now bwforwhand and look into what you re getting in to </s>
<s> plus at dell support they shoul also explain the process to add a 2nd hd to the system though it maybe generic in nature it covers the topic well </s>
