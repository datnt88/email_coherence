<s> in general you need a router </s>
<s> each computer needs a network adapter </s>
<s> the router and network adapters can be wired or wireless your choice </s>
<s> some 2wire gateways are a combination dsl modem router with 4 network ports and wireless capability </s>
<s> which one model do you have </s>
<s> the 2wire model i have is 1701hg gateway </s>
<s> what is a network adapter </s>
<s> thanks anthony </s>
<s> your 2wire 1701hg gateway is supposed to have 4 ports for making wired connections and the ability to make wireless connections </s>
<s> connect up to 4 computers with a newtork cable to share the broadband internet service </s>
<s> the network cable plugs into the computer s network adapter sometimes called an ethernet adapter network interface card nic 10 100 adapter et al </s>
<s> if you want to make wireless connections to your 2wire gateway your gateway needs to be wireless capable and each computer that is to connect wirelessly is to have a wireless network adapter that is compatible with the gateway </s>
<s> if your gateway doesn t have multiple network ports or wireless capability you can add a wireless broadband router to it </s>
