<s> i have an hp pavilion a6244n desktop </s>
<s> i need a replacement power supply for bestec atx 250 12z rev d6r </s>
<s> is there a compatible replacement available </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> here s one for the herd </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you want to look at the physical size and specs for bestec model </s>
<s> once you have that in hand you compare to any similar or direct replacement psu </s>
<s> so be 100 sure the model is what is stated on the decal sticker located on the psu </s>
<s> then do your search </s>
<s> if as robert states is correct you maybe lucky and have a common atx 12v type sized psu which many are generic to your needs </s>
<s> btw having more wattage and or connections won t hurt </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> it s single rail </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> thanks for that </s>
<s> after all the psu s i ve replaced over the years one of the best pieces of advice i found was to get a single rail when possible </s>

<s> granddaughter s pc fails </s>
<s> it s got an inexpensive psu in it now and this one at 45 net will be worthwhile to have as a spare or a substitute if i decide to upgrade the system </s>
