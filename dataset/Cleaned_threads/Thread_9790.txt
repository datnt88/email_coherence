<s> recently i scavenged an old 486 laptop </s>
<s> it boots and says it is media magic pn315 dstn </s>
<s> bios detects 8mb of ram </s>
<s> i want to put it to work somehow but first i would like to put in more memory </s>
<s> the beast has 2 slots filled with strange memory modules </s>
<s> i never met such things </s>
<s> please help me identify them </s>
<s> br </s>
<s> br do i have any chance of finding the upgrade </s>
<s> where would you advice to look </s>
<s> google search gives pretty much nothing relevant </s>
<s> it seems to have existed indeed because it s mentioned by however the standard site for looking for memory has never heard of media magic </s>
<s> a search for pn315 only turns up very standard looking pc 133 128 and 256 mb sdram and that doesn t look right at all </s>
<s> i think the chances of finding this memory are rather small </s>
<s> moreover do you have any information on the maximum amount of ram supported </s>
<s> it might be 8 or 16 which still isn t much </s>
<s> the interesting question what s the os on this machine and what would you want to do with it once you put in more memory </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> many laptops from that era topped out at 8m to 16mb </s>
<s> about all i see running on such is the dos windows 3 1 that matched that time as well as damn small linux </s>

<s> thanks everyone for help it looks like edo memory </s>
<s> i found the datasheet on the chip used 424400 and tracked the pinout with a tester </s>
<s> each of the modules seem to have 32 bit wide data bus 4 cas signals to strobe the column address for each individual byte and 1 ras </s>
<s> so it is pretty much like 72pin simm though with only one ras signal </s>
<s> by the way i checked through jedec jesd 21c standard </s>
<s> it lists a lot of wierd memory configs but none with 60 pins on it </s>
<s> so the memory does not conform to jedec </s>
<s> on both memory slots cas signals different as well as rases </s>
<s> all other signals are common to both slots </s>
<s> i just wonder if a bit of soldering will enable me to use a regular 72 pin simm in here </s>
<s> am i understanding correctly that wiring just one ras signal to the simm will simply allow me to use just half of memory </s>
<s> dear bob do you remember what was the cause for this limit </s>
<s> was it unovercomable hardware limitations or it was bios </s>
<s> why i am asking if it is bios then i can simply specify the memory size for linux loader and for windows loader explicitly </s>
<s> i found an old i266mmx with 64mb for 99 bucks a compaq armada </s>
<s> what this proves is that for the cost of old edo ram unless found cheap that you should start hunting down other laptops </s>
<s> this thing would be like you trying to take a model a on a freeway or to the local repair shop </s>
<s> the limits were not the address space of the cpu but economics of those days where 64mb could cost well past a few 1 000 bucks </s>
<s> being that no one could put that much ram in the designs were made to only support 8 to 16mb for many boards </s>
<s> in closing i d only explore use with dos win3 1 or damn small linux </s>
