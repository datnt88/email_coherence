<s> every tablet i ve seen runs on apple ios or android or blackberry os etc </s>
<s> i haven t seen one that says it runs on windows 7 and includes ms office mobile </s>
<s> i want compatibility which my current pda lacks as its os and office mobile programs are outdated even though i purchased it just before upgrading my laptop to win 7 and office 2010 </s>
<s> if there are no win 7 os tablets what tablet would best sync seamless with a win7 office2010 laptop </s>
<s> i want my seamless integration back </s>
<s> currently i have to back up my laptop work files backup my pda work files then hope activesynch and win mob dev ctr are getting along </s>
<s> then pray </s>
<s> then i usually have to manually update files and replace files that should not have been deleted </s>
<s> then once my work files are on the pda i m forded to save them under a new name but then i change them back to their old names </s>
<s> only then will everything be properly synched a step a few years ago would have taken minutes and i could do every day </s>
<s> reading it s for windows phone so the answer is that it won t run on windows 7 the os </s>
<s> there are tablets that run windows 7 and you can run office on those </s>
<s> but then that s not quot office mobile quot is it </s>
<s> is just one of the handful of windows 7 tablets </s>
<s> before i would consider that i d pick up one of the new ultrabooks </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i appreciate the info </s>
<s> however i ll have to look into what an ultrabook is </s>
<s> also i m thinking of waiting for windows 8 i ve read that some win 8 tablets might go on sale in the third quarter of this year </s>
<s> taoskier otherwise known as bill ps office mobile is just a scaled down version of office that came w my last three hp pdas </s>
<s> however hp appers to be turning their attention to phones </s>
<s> i thought my first non wifi pda was great the second even better with wifi but the third had little memory or power and as i see it it was almost obsolete on arrival </s>
<s> office mobile has been included on my hp pdas so wikipedia is wrong if it says w mobile is exclusively for phones </s>
<s> while i know what that title is i thought it best to pitch this in that manner so we could move on with the discussion </s>
