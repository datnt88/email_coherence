<s> hello i just replaced a customer s faulty cable to bring back their cd rw and dvdrom drive </s>
<s> the dvd rom drive functionality is in question </s>
<s> windows sees this as a cd rom drive </s>
<s> nowhere have i run into any dvd rom driver info for this seemingly generic device </s>
<s> i tried the aida and sandra utilities and both cannot id the manufacturer and every description of the device is simply quot dvdrom 1 0x quot </s>
<s> wondering if anyone has encountered the same situation and can lend any expertise as to this drive s true identity </s>
<s> happy weekend jay </s>
<s> windows 98 didn t know about dvdrom drives and would report it as a cdrom except in some well installed instances </s>
<s> for example very few know how to install this old os anymore </s>
<s> 99 of the time the motherboard drivers don t get installed </s>
<s> beyond that it s just a very old os that didn t know about such a drive </s>
<s> if it plays a dvd with the dvd software then it s done </s>

<s> hi bob thank you major lesson learned here </s>
<s> spent a lot of time looking at taiwainese web sites and questionable drivers which i wisely never downloaded </s>
