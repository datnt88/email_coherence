<s> my 4 5 year old build s power supply finally crapped out last week and i have replaced with a corsair tx650 </s>
<s> receive new psu plug it all in power up and everything seems fine </s>
<s> the leds on the mouse and keyboard turned on with the computer so i assume everythings perfect </s>
<s> however i get no response from either mouse or keyboard when trying to log in access bios </s>
<s> i switch usb ports with no success </s>
<s> infact the leds on mouse keyboard would only be on if you boot the computer up with them plugged into the usb port </s>
<s> if i try to switch ports when the computer s on the leds will go off and stay off but they would flash on briefly when i pull them out of the ports after the first swap </s>
<s> very weird </s>
<s> i figure worst case scenario i scoop a ps2 mouse keyboard but i certainly dont want to if i dont have to </s>
<s> ayudame </s>
<s> but try the rear usb ports and then consider that when a psu fails it can fry things on the way out </s>
<s> be sure to test that keyboard and mouse on another pc as well as consider the old issue of extra mounting studs we find all the time in home built machines </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> as bob proffitt said trying units on another system is one check to do </s>
<s> i d get my hands on a ps 2 mouse to make further checks specifically device manager to see what is going on with usb function errors update s etc </s>
<s> since it is possible that it could me a device hardware failure </s>
<s> if that should be the case get a pci slot usb card and stuff that in the system that might just remedy the situation </s>
