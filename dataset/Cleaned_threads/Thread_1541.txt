<s> i m hoping someone here can help me </s>
<s> i am using a d link di 524 802 11g wireless wired router </s>
<s> i have spent the past several days trying to get everything working properly and quickly </s>
<s> i have two computers that i want to connect wirelessly to the router </s>
<s> when i connect using wifi i can generally maintain connection speeds of 54mbps </s>
<s> however when i run speed tests and i have run many many of them i only get between 1 and 2 mbps using wireless </s>
<s> when i plug my laptop directly into the router i can get anywhere from 5 7 or so mbps </s>
<s> wireless transfers are even relatively slow when transfering files between my two computers </s>
<s> i have tried several different types and brands of routers and i have changed all of the settings that i know about </s>
<s> i ve messed around with changing encryption levels and nothing really changes </s>
<s> i have also tried changing channels but nothing seems to really speed things up </s>
<s> the fastest transfers i can ever get between my two systems run a little over 1 mb per sec but it is usually around 300 k sec or so which is way too slow </s>
<s> any suggestions are greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> wired speed can be 100 megabit full duplex on a switched hub when maintains speed due to the switch </s>
<s> i ll leave you to learn why a switched hub matters </s>
<s> wifi might be 54 megabit half duplex and is on a shared airspace which can easily be interfered with </s>
<s> your numbers are quite normal and you need to learn about the technology you are using </s>
<s> i can t educate you about all this in this small space but there are fine web contents that you can keep reading till it sinks in </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> a wireless quot g quot environment will result in the lower speed being obtained </s>
<s> a pure quot g quot network will yield better throughput </s>
