<s> mk so many problems here i recently got a hp g71 laptop from a friend who said thatit would not start up correctly and the bootmgr was broken </s>
<s> well in my attempt to fix it i found that the d drive was also missing </s>
<s> so as i tried to fix bootmgr using a windows 7 repair disc and going through that crap i eventually found that the bootmgr cant be fixed till the hard drive is </s>
<s> so i ran this thing where it says at the top checking disk local disk d and i knew there was bad clusters so i checked the thing about attempt to clean up bad clusters </s>
<s> so far this checking disk thing has been going on for almost 3 days </s>
<s> and its at about 60 progress i would also like to wipe everything off the laptop before i give it to my girlfriend that way she pretty much has a fresh start and not a ton of crap </s>
<s> my questions are is it supposed to take this long </s>
<s> am i on the right path </s>
<s> gt if i m no t how do i fix this </s>
<s> will doing all this wipe my hard drive like i want </s>
<s> any questions i will answer to the best of my abilities </s>
<s> my first thought if i d gotten such a laptop would be to do a factory re installation of the system so i d have some starting point </s>
<s> if the restore partition was still good and accessible this would be a good thing to try </s>
<s> unfortunately i don t know the keystrokes to attempt this but you could check the hp web site for instructions </s>
<s> it may be that the restore partition is gone or damaged and you cannot fix this without the proper media </s>
<s> i would wonder as well if the issue could have occurred by the laptop being dropped and the hd suffering physical damage </s>
<s> in that case you d need a new drive </s>
<s> you could try to pull the drive to see who manufactured it go to their web site and find their diagnostics disk to check the drive </s>
<s> you d need to make bootable media to do so </s>
<s> if the drive is good but you ve no way to rebuild the system due to lack of proper disks you go to hp and ask to purchase them if available </s>
<s> that s about all i can offer as there s no known history to give a hint as to what the problem could have been caused by </s>
<s> did you try using the restore media for this pc </s>
<s> idk how i would do the media thing but when i tried to do all the restore points and everything i was not able to </s>
<s> it was all because the hard drive was missing and when i would look at the hard drive in some windows it wouldn t show the amount of memory it had and when i opened it it would have no files in it </s>
<s> so i ended up popping off the back to make sure it was secure </s>
<s> and as far as the history of the damage </s>
<s> apparently this was my friend s friend s computer </s>
<s> and she one day got pissed off and threw it to the ground and punched it </s>
<s> then when she started the computer it started with the whole broken bootmgr </s>
<s> if this is true i d say you not only need a new laptop but maybe some new friends </s>
<s> i d not put a dime into it </s>
<s> if the screen isn t damaged maybe you can ebay it for parts </s>
<s> well my friends are fine xd its my friends of friends that are a little outgoing and brutal p yeah she beat the crap out of it then when she started it up she apparently said quot i think it got a virus quot with all serious ness too </s>
<s> i couldn t help but laugh </s>
<s> anyways i just received the laptop for free and if i could fix it i still get to keep it </s>
<s> soooo lets say that the hard drive is able to work it just isn t </s>
<s> how would i go about fixing it in its current state </s>
<s> it is still doing the checking disk thing where it says xxxxxxx free clusters processed </s>
<s> would this clean up all the bad clusters </s>
<s> then after this what would i do to continue fixing it to eventually get it in working order </s>
<s> you need the recovery restore discs for that model laptop </s>
<s> or an install os disc that s from retail sources </s>
<s> you can order a replacement disc from hp provided it is still available in wares for some cost </s>
<s> this cost is usually less than store brought </s>
<s> i suggest you query for those disc s in order to attempt a reload of the os </s>
<s> you can contact hp for details via the hp support website look for replacement discs </s>
<s> with all the problems you have then that s the way to go provided you have a display on the screen </s>
<s> of course contact your friend and see what discs they have available </s>
<s> beware though there maybe a possibility the hd is actually bad which is either part of multiple problems or the source of </s>
<s> no matter you need those disc s </s>
<s> a quick test is to get the ubuntu quot livecd quot version burn to disc using the iso file </s>
<s> once done it should be bootable place in drive and reboot </s>
<s> that way you do some testing and accessing to see what if anything is wrong </s>
<s> that is a freebie os and works on many laptops </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> program </s>
<s> these can be downloaded as an image and burned to floppy or cd </s>
<s> they ll tell you if the hd is good or not </s>
<s> if not you need to get a new hd to make it work </s>
<s> as willy said a live linux disk could be of value as it can check your other hardware for functionality </s>
<s> it can t do much in the way of hard drive diagnostics though </s>
<s> but the check finally finished yep the hard drive is screwed </s>
<s> lol my girlfriend isnt too happy about it </s>
<s> know anyone wanting to buy laptop parts </s>
<s> xd </s>
