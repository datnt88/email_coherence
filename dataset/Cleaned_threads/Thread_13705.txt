<s> just from reading what i have so far </s>
<s> wireless networking appears to be an access to the internet isp without wires </s>
<s> it sounds as if rather than having an dial up access to the internet or a dsl cable connection you have a reauter </s>
<s> i am not so sure about my above interpetation though </s>
<s> because it s called wireless networking so i suppose you must have more than one computer operating off of this reuter but dont you have to have the reuter near or in the computer whatever a reuter is </s>
<s> i guess my main question is not so much what wireless networking is i guess i want to know how does it affect the family pc </s>
<s> is wireless networking replacing dsl and cable isp s in the home </s>
<s> or is it just a business thing </s>
<s> second is wireless networking just a connection to the internet do you still need to have an internet service provider </s>
<s> o k </s>
<s> i know you can tell that i am very knew to using computers and internet service providers </s>
<s> as i type i m just switching from dial up to cable </s>
<s> so please be gentle towards me quot a novice quot in your answers </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> your internet connection must be dsl or cable </s>
<s> connect a wireless router to the dsl or cable modem </s>
<s> install a wireless nic into the desktop or laptop </s>
<s> you can now access the internet via the modem using rf radio frequency in the ghz bandwidth </s>
<s> my home network has a wireless router d link di 614 </s>
<s> i have three desktops wired to three ports and the laptop has a wireless nic </s>
<s> i can use it all over the house </s>
<s> i could install a wireless nic into one of the desktops and use it in another room without running cat 5 wire </s>
<s> that s it </s>
<s> thanks a lot for that info </s>
<s> i was thinking that quot wireless networking quot was replacing isp s </s>
<s> from your response i understand that you still need a cable or dsl isp </s>
<s> but this way you don t have to have a seperate dsl or cable modem for each computer </s>
<s> the router connects to the dsl or cable modem </s>
<s> the router s ports connect to each pc wired or wireless </s>
<s> hence the name router it routes the data to each pc </s>
<s> and with a router you get a pretty good firewall to block unwanted junk from hitting your pc </s>
<s> and with a router and more pcs you can build a little home network </s>
