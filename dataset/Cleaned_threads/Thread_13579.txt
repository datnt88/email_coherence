<s> i really enjoy bass but i don t necessarily need my teeth chattering </s>
<s> i want to hear and feel the thump from the bass but not so heavy that it drowns out the mids and highs </s>
<s> ive done some research but i get mixed reviews on whether or not the gigaworks can provide a clean heavy bass not exactly sub woofer quality but still great </s>
<s> also klipsch is a known high quality brand and i m hoping to use these speakers for a long time </s>
<s> if anyone here has owned or heard both i would love your input if you haven t then any advice can help </s>
<s> i ve also selected the bose companion 2 series 2 as a possibility </s>
<s> promedia 2 1 and it s served me well for quite some time </s>
<s> i don t game but i do enjoy music at reasonable quality </s>
<s> it s really a matter of adjusting the bass to the right level as any sub woofer can get muddy sounding </s>
<s> my main home speaker system is still a pair of old jbl l65s a studio monitor series that spoils me but the klipsch are nice on my pc </s>
<s> i don t need or want more than 2 1 good luck in your search but it s your ears that should do the judging </s>
