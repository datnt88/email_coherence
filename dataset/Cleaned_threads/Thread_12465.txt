<s> i just recently upgraded everything but my gpu which is the nvidia geforce gt 520 my screen now randomly flickers and makes the sound as if a usb has been unplugged </s>
<s> i m running windows 8 as i was on my last pc and it never did such thing </s>
<s> i tried the latest drivers for the card and even some previous versions and nothing has fixed this </s>
<s> gaming seems to make it happen just a bit more frequently and sometimes it minimizes the game and flashes non stop resulting in a reboot </s>
<s> other system components are i5 3570k 8gb ddr3 ram 1tb hdd any advice would be great because i m at a loss </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> and is this a fresh install of the os </s>
<s> and finally why not give a short run down of the machine before and after </s>
<s> if you changed the motherboard the classic gaffe is to leave an extra mounting post where there should be none </s>

<s> hey bob </s>
<s> i m running a completely new system from the tower to everything inside of it except the gpu </s>
<s> completely fresh os install of win8 </s>
<s> my old system was a core 2 duo e5300 4gb of ram 250gb hdd win8 and i forget the exact mobo but it was an lga775 with q35 chipset </s>
<s> i ve also noticed that when the screen flashes and i have the display options in front of me it goes from displaying quot syncmaster p2350 g p23500 quot to quot generic non pnp monitor quot then flashes back and changes the name to my display device </s>
<s> it s weird </s>
<s> sorry if i left out any information still kind of new to the forum scene </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> and yes everything including power supply </s>
<s> sorry but i m not seeing makers catch up with the changes </s>
<s> we do know there are issues </s>
<s> and just yesterday i read about a game that was glitching just like you described and no fix is out yet </s>
<s> be sure to chat with motherboard and video card makers if they have updates </s>
<s> but that won t help that game issue </s>
<s> bob </s>
