<s> does anyone have any great ideas about how to get data off of my ext hd </s>
<s> the hard drive used successfully less than 1 month is definitely bad and wd support says quot well if possible move all data off the drive </s>
<s> at this point you will need to have the drive replace quot running winxp ext hd is western digital passport 160gb </s>
<s> have tried connecting ext hd to a desktop just in case problem was with my laptop no good </s>
<s> when i connect ext hd all is good </s>
<s> then once i start to actually use the thing it eventually stops responding so i disconnect ext hd reconnect and resume </s>
<s> generally can copy a few files over to laptop before it stops but with over 40gb already on there i could be at this all year </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas </s>
<s> i am furious about the cavalier attitude that wd is taking about my data </s>
<s> to pull the drive out of the case and apply directly to the forehead </s>
<s> ahh no i mean the desktop s internal spare ide connection </s>
<s> if you re lucky the pc will boot and see the drive and you can copy data off </s>
<s> if not then software like zero assumption recovery there s a demo is tried </s>
<s> gt about cavalier </s>
<s> where is your backup copy </s>
<s> hard disks will fail </s>
<s> you just don t know when </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> technology sorry if it wasn t clear in the original post this is an external hard drive </s>
<s> i certainly have had hard drives fail before but i guess i figured that an external hard drive expecially one used for 1 month never bumped in fact never traveled off of the desk wouldn t put me through this </s>
<s> and perhaps dumb questions but what is the point of a 160gb ext hard drive if that has to be backed up as well </s>
<s> it s still a hard disk </s>
<s> and to add insult to injury i found i could corrupt many usb hard disks if they were used as supplied </s>
<s> many come with the somewhat unstable fat32 formatting so just a matter of writing to the drive and pulling the usb cable can have the entire contents vanish </s>
<s> it s a magic trick i use to show how unstable these devices are when fresh out of the box </s>
<s> i proceed to the second magic trick of wiping the drive then making a ntfs partition </s>
<s> while ntfs is not damage proof it certainly has faired better in my torture tests </s>
<s> do they tell you this </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> gt you re right to think that it shouldn t need to be backed up but the truths remain that it s a hard disk and could be the stock fragile fat32 formatting </s>
<s> good luck in recovery </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well my stinky little hard drive must ve quot understood quot how angry i was just after i posted i managed to get one solid hour of the hd staying mounted </s>
<s> have managed to recover most of the data so i got that goin for me </s>
<s> which is nice </s>
<s> thanks a million or maybe even 160gb </s>
<s> for your assistance bob </s>
<s> since i don t think i ll be able to get my money back guess i am stuck with getting a new wd hd </s>
<s> will reformat to ntfs the second i get it home </s>
<s> tangentially do you have any opinions about one mfg or another </s>
<s> who makes the best ext hd </s>
<s> jenni the soon to be ntfs magician </s>
<s> hard disk cases that are well ventilated </s>
<s> i like a small quiet fan but if it s for some server room i don t wince at a louder fan that pushes more air </s>
<s> at the office most usb drives are self assembled units </s>
<s> we get some drive on sale and then pick up some usb housing </s>
<s> all of us know what a screwdriver is so it s not very challenging to put the 2 parts together </s>
<s> gt let me share what i use to sync my stuff with my external drive </s>
<s> syncback google com gets this done for me </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i like it </s>
<s> wish i had been daring enough to do that </s>
<s> another question would you suggest that i replace the hd or iyho would reformatting to ntfs suffice </s>
<s> suggestions on quot reading material quot on reformatting to ntfs </s>
<s> i see that in quot my computer quot if i right click on the hd and select quot format quot there is the option to reformat to ntfs does that reformat the same as from cmd </s>
<s> whoops guess that is more than one question </s>
<s> but you ll bare with me won t you bob </s>
<s> jenni the ever curious </s>
<s> use xp s disk management see start help and then remove the partition on said drive create it fresh and let it quick format it </s>
<s> if the drive is suspect i ll later test it </s>
<s> to manually start the disk scanner if your computer is formatted with the ntfs file system run chkdsk f r on the new drive letter start run cmd and enter the command there </s>
<s> you must restart your computer before the disk scan begins </s>
<s> be sure to have a spare hour for it to work </s>

<s> i copied some text in from other places and i didn t rewrite it </s>
