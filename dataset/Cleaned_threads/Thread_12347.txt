<s> i am looking to upgrade using a barebone as i have a lot of components i like already </s>
<s> i know it ll be faster than my single core 3500 overclocked to single core 3800 speed </s>
<s> what do people think of this 45w at load processor </s>
<s> at stock each core is 125 mhz faster than my current 3500 it meets gta 4 minimum requirements </s>
<s> i know the cache is only 512 but so is my single core 3500 is as well so i don t care about it </s>
<s> what really attracts me to it is the price power consumption that will take a big load off my 450w power supply and if need be overclocking room to my voltage </s>
<s> my current asus ai over clocked processor voltage is 1 4 and it s been stable for 11 months </s>
<s> the 4850e voltage is only 1 1 1 2 volts </s>
<s> it makes sense to me </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> my only question is what s the deal with am2 ram not running at full speed unless the cpu speed is exactly divisible by 400 </s>
<s> when i do overclock the cpu i will do it so my ddr2 6400 memory runs at full speed </s>
<s> i though it was called quot the odd multiplier issue quot because it only effects multipliers when they are odd numbered i e </s>
<s> 13x so if you get an even numbered multiplier there are not the same problems </s>
<s> is a good quick and dirty guide here are some of the numbers 200mhz reference clock 12x clock multiplier 2400mhz cpu frequency 2400mhz cpu frequency 6 400mhz ddr2 800 memory frequency odd clock multiplier 200mhz reference clock 13x clock muliplier 2600mhz cpu frequency 2600mhz cpu frequency 6 433mhz ddr2 866 memory frequency 2600mhz cpu frequency 7 371mhz ddr2 742 memory frequency i very much doubt that anybody could tell the difference in everyday use without having to use bench numbers </s>
