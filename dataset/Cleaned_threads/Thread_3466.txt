<s> is it possible to have 1 wireless keyboard control 2 pcs at the same time </s>
<s> say i type on the keyboard and the things i type come out as tect on both pcs </s>
<s> if this is possible how would i go about setting it up </s>
<s> i would buy 2 wireless keyboards and set up the 2 recievers but is there a way to set them to the same frequency </s>
<s> i have never owned a wireless keyboard so im not sure if this is possible or not </s>
<s> wireless keyboard only works for one pc at a time </s>
<s> you can however move the usb thing that comes with the keyboard to another pc and use the keyboard from there </s>
<s> you can t operate 2 pcs simultaneously but you can install a kvm switch and use 1 mouse and keyboard with multiple monitors and pcs </s>
<s> check with your local micro center or comp usa or best buy or radio shack </s>

<s> i was told i could only have my monitor keyboard and mouse all hooked up at once </s>
<s> from what you were saying i could only have my mouse and keyboard hooked up and keep my 2 monitors </s>
<s> can i just only hook up my mouse and keyboard </s>
<s> if i can just hook up the mouse and keyboard what is the delay between switching from one pc to the other </s>
<s> using a kvm switch you can operate 2 computers using one keyboard monitor and mouse kvm </s>
<s> however i don t believe you can address both units at the same time at least in my experience </s>
<s> you use a hot key or manual switch to toggle between desktops </s>
<s> if the two machines are networked you can of course move files between them </s>
<s> you can have 2 pc s with 2 monitors controlled by one keyboard and 1 mouse </s>
<s> the speed of switching depends on what kind of kvm you get </s>
<s> there are kvm switches that can work with ps 2 or usb keyboards and mice </s>
<s> the ps 2 kvm switch switches between pc s faster than the usb version 1 second vs 3 4 seconds because with the usb version the pc you switch to has to re recognize the device vis usb </s>
<s> multiplicity </s>
<s> look here and find out if it suit you </s>
