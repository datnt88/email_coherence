<s> i have a very frustrating problem with this monitor </s>
<s> sometimes it works fine for days then suddenly goes black and stays that way for days then i switch it on randomly and up it comes again </s>
<s> when it goes black and i switch it off and on again it lights up perfectly for a fraction of a second before going black again </s>
<s> i can repeat this as many times as i want then some day itll come right again </s>
<s> i fix pcs for a living so understand technology in general but have never worked on screens anybody give me any pointers </s>
<s> any help on how to physically strip it down would be helpful too as i tend to break little plastic catches and things thanks a lot roger </s>
<s> read where that failure was traced down to a common issue </s>
<s> remember that service manuals are rare to non existent because these are consumer disposables </s>
<s> it s likely you ll have to wing and do the microscopic inspection of all solder joints and reflow any that look even the tiniest suspicious </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you know when i started repairing computers not he early 90s there was no internet so no forums how did i manage </s>
<s> guys like you make my life liveable </s>
<s> and of course as you realise i didn t do a search </s>
<s> at least i don t think i did it was late at night here in england </s>
<s> but i think i assumed this was a one off thanks again will get the hot poker out tonight </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> wow roger sounds like a lot of fun </s>
<s> intermitents in anything can be a nightmare </s>
<s> have you checked the inverter most lcd s use one could be iffy connectivity there that is the first place i would look if that isn t the problem like bob said get out your jeweler s loop and check solder joints but i wouldn t put a lot of time into it </s>
<s> it is just a fair monitor to begin with </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> well i ve completely taken it to bits and all my boards are very different to this one i suppose i can just check for obvious dry joints on what i assume to be the inverter board </s>
<s> but although its vaguely the same shape and the same yellowish colour it hasnt got those coils and things </s>
<s> ok just in case any other poor sod is reading this there would appear to be quite different inverter boards in what appears to be the same monitor i followed a trail of links from this thread and eventually found somebody else with the same inverter power board as me no toroidal coils etc but some big caps which had ballooned a bit at the top </s>
<s> he replace them and pronounced it fine one of mine was the same so i ve replaced the lot it s fine so far </s>
<s> woo hoo </s>
<s> now all i need is a cheap replacement screen for a packard bell c3300 notebook which somebody sat on </s>
