<s> admittedly i have more lost days than getting it days </s>
<s> but i think i can verbalize my current confusion so that ya ll know that i m a complete puter illiterate or i have one of my rare good questions ok here s why i m confused </s>
<s> if i want to print from my laptop most days i can do so however there are days when no matter what i do i can t get anything to print from the laptop the network printer has a usb connection to a dell dimension 2400 and there is never a problem printing from that machine </s>

<s> and yet the very best functioning for my network printing come when there are no printers installed on my laptop </s>
<s> i really don t like doing stuff that i don t understand just because that s the only way it ll work so i d sure appreciate it if someone could explain to me why my laptop print function works best when there is no printer installed on the laptop or if the truth is that i have just not yet discovered how to properly install the network printer on my laptop </s>
