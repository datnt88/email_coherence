<s> hello all i am having challenges with accessing webmail and downloading e mail from that account on my lenovo t61 wirelessly </s>
<s> i have vista 32b with 140g hd </s>
<s> i did update my system yesterday to connect to a wireless hot spot within one of my offices and had no problems at that time </s>
<s> it was not until i arrived at another office the challenges started </s>
<s> i have tried doing a restore to no avail as it fails </s>
<s> i am able to get e mail and access webmail from other computers so i know it is up and working </s>
<s> any other suggestions or tricks for me to try in order to resolve this </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> while installing vista is one thing getting windows to work proper afterwards is far too hard today as the 10 or so drivers we must find after we install microsoft s os </s>
<s> the reason for your issue or the clue is not in your posts </s>
