<s> i want to upgrade my pc in the next six months mainly to future proof for gaming </s>
<s> i don t have a bad rig now but would like pci 3 capacity </s>
<s> therefore my question is should i wait for haswell or purchase a sandy bridge e or ivy bridge </s>
<s> my specs are as follows intel i5 2500k 3 3ghz nvidia gtx 680 12 gig ddr 3 ram 750w corsair psu 1 tb wd hdd oh yes i mainly play mmos and am looking forward to the elder scrolls </s>
<s> also do i need ddr 4 ram </s>
<s> thanks so much for any help </s>
<s> after decades there is no future proof pc </s>
<s> as to ddr 4 i think i read a tom s hardware note that read our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a 225 lga 1155 core i5 2500k and a 1000 lga 2011 core i7 3960x even when three way graphics card configurations are involved </s>
<s> it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don t hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge based machines </s>
<s> quot so it s not a cpu issue and the items you asked about are not here in mass today </s>
<s> my advice is to pick the best video card you can stand from this list </s>
<s> then close your wallet </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> alot can happen in 6 mos </s>
<s> maybe even a price break </s>
<s> further whatever becomes the hot thing cools and becomes yesterday s forgotten item </s>
<s> you need to concentrate on what you really need </s>
<s> if you can wait all the better </s>
<s> you re a prime example of a gamer wanting the whole enchilada </s>
<s> if some item can bridge that time gap go for it </s>
<s> if it becomes more a shew of items then certainly wait it usually worth it </s>
<s> plus by the time you got everything you wanted something else can certainly make itself more appealing </s>
<s> gaming just tends to wreak havoc if the quot whole pc quot isn t considered and thus look for what makes a continuing good match overall </s>
<s> in other words don t sup up the ram when all you need probably less like 8gb vs 16gb </s>
<s> get the cpu if you like but generally speaking it seems the gpu is the real center of attention in the gaming world everything else supports that feature more or less </s>
<s> of course a hot user friendly mtrbd </s>
<s> is a real plus </s>
<s> visit gaming website for surefire info on what s really best to include tomshardware website </s>
<s> that website alone provides tested results that are good to know </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
