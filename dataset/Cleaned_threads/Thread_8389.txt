<s> im trying to upgrade the processor on my gateway 503gr and was wondering what my options are </s>
<s> if anyone could help w this it d be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> the gateway 503gr uses the intel 915 chipset and you can only upgrade to another pentium 4 500 series processor no pentium d no core2duo </s>
<s> you may be able to use a p4 600 series cpu but you should contact gateway since intel s 915 mobos only support 500 series and lower p4s since you already have a 3ghz p4 only a 3 4ghz chip could be considered an upgrade </s>
<s> but the p4 500 series was superseded by the 600 series 2 years ago and i can t find any retail 500 series cpus </s>
<s> you might take a look at ebay and see what s avaiable </s>
<s> get the cpu z pgm google for the source then run it </s>
<s> it will id the cpu you truly have </s>
<s> that way you get the same class cpu and then decide the best cpu the system will handle </s>
<s> gateway isn t that forthcoming in such details but likely you can install a 3 4mhz cpu </s>
<s> it important to find the quot multiplier value quot or fsb as this will allow to what speed cpu you can accept as a drop in </s>
<s> if the value is already what your current cpu is installed you may not be able to upgrade higher as you re locked in to what the mtrbd </s>
<s> supports </s>
<s> i saw no cpu upgrade from gateway but you can ask if such is possible email them and hope for a response </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> eck i contacted gateway and they said they have no compatible upgrades on the market i saw a few at zipzoomfly om that may be but id ont wanna spend another 100 for a slight upgrade when i just spent 300 for a card i think i may try my hand at building a whole new 1 my 2 pc s are kinda old hp1040n and the gateway 503gr and i figure ill be needing a new 1 in the coming years to play games w direct x 10 and whatnot </s>
