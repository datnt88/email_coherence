<s> i have a somewhat old computer a dell xps 410 i m looking to add a bit more ram to </s>
<s> i was flipping through the owner s manual and found that it takes dual channel 533 667 or 800mhz ddr2 ram </s>
<s> how can i be sure that s what i should get or should i take the manual s word for it </s>
<s> i m also wondering about the limit of memory it states in the manual which is listed as 4gb </s>
<s> once again how can i be sure that s all i can put in it or should i again take the manual s word for it </s>
<s> and a bit of a silly question but i feel i should ask would it be best to buy an 800 mhz over the other two </s>
<s> would it run load faster than 533 or 667 </s>
<s> thanks a bunch </s>
<s> go to and input the pc s specs </s>
<s> it will recommend the exact fit </s>
<s> as far as speed the new modules will run at the existing module s speed </s>
<s> okay that answered my first two questions </s>
<s> but what do you mean quot the new modules will run at the existing module s speed quot are you saying the mhz i choose doesn t matter they all run at the same speed </s>
<s> so far the speed is set by either the lowest speed in the memory sticks or by the cpu or chipset </s>
<s> if they give you faster fine </s>
<s> if they give you what you have or what the machine support all good </s>
<s> bob </s>
