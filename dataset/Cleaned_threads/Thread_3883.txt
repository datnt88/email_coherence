<s> the radeon 9800 xt cranks out about 46 fps on doom 3 is it worth buying the 9800 xt or would the performance from the 9800 pro version sufficient enough to play doom 3 </s>
<s> because vendors are selling the xt version for twice as much as the pro version </s>
<s> your oersonal satisfaction with the games performance is the key parameter in the cost effectiveness equation </s>
<s> most gamers brag about the fps they get and if someone beats them they immediately scrap their video card and get the latest and the greatest </s>
<s> this from someone that has never played a game on a computer so not very meaningful </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> read the readme txt file included in the pc game cd </s>
<s> therein you can find some comments and tips about the use of various video cards when playing the game as well as compatibility issues if there exists </s>
<s> some games are selective of video cards like the compatibility issues of nvidia and voodoo cards to some games </s>
<s> read it i am sorry i don t have that kind of game </s>
<s> it will also give you the readme txt perhaps the best setting to make and in some instances the best type and brand of video card to opt for </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> you may want to spend a little extra so you dont have to upgrade in say a year or so so long as the rest of your system wont have to be upgraded to run games as well </s>
<s> i think you need to take into consideration what your system is now </s>
<s> case in point my own xp pro 2000 athlon 1 67 ghz 512 ddr ram 266 front side bus </s>
<s> put in an fx5900 xt card </s>
<s> plays far cry a little bit better at medium and low resolutions w aa turned off </s>
<s> my daughter s recently upgraded system p4 2 8 ghz celeron d 512 ddr ram 533 mhz fsb </s>
<s> her system plays almost equally as well with a ti4200 vid card </s>
<s> point is i have a better videcard but there s obviously a bottleneck caused by my slower cpu and fsb </s>
<s> check your system specs before you spend a lot of money on a vid card they may not meet your expectations if your system isn t up to snuff </s>
<s> even if your system is up to snuff i have a persoanl bias against ati boards </s>
<s> i ve heard more stories about the catalyst drivers hosing people s systems or the cards not working in a windows box </s>
<s> but that s my bias and what i ve heard from friends </s>
<s> using a high end card on a low end system is like putting premium gasoline in a motor scooter </s>
<s> you d more than likely be wasting money </s>
<s> even if you bought the best video card out there ultimatly the framerate is regulated by the game itself </s>
<s> it will only go so fast and that is it so game mfg s recommend certain cards probably have some deal going with card mfg s i havent found any games that are not compatible with my nvidia 5200 just make sure that you have a big enough card to run the games you want example a 32mb card will play ms flight 4 kinda most of the game isnt rendered just by lack of memory </s>
<s> my card is a 256mb gainward nvidia card that i paid 80 bucks for new and works with what ever i throw at it </s>
<s> i dont think i will out grow that card for a long time to come good luck and i hope it helped </s>
<s> dont u do that </s>
<s> even though the performance of the xt is better than the pro obviously y wud they bother 2 give it a diff name </s>
<s> its not bad 100 mhz higher clock speed shaders improved etc its like if the price was lesser and u dont own any card u might wanna consider buyin it i say u shud stay with da pro for like two years untill another game comes out and ur card is on the minimum requirments list </s>
<s> just kiddin just stick around with the pro card its awesum wish i owned it </s>
<s> i have a 9600 xt but im still very happy </s>
