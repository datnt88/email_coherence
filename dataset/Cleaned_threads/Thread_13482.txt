<s> on a sony viao desktop computer </s>
<s> i took the heat difuser if the processor to clean dust out </s>
<s> put new heat sink compound on and re installed </s>
<s> now computer will not begin to start but will stop and start again </s>
<s> anyone have this problem </s>
<s> we don t know your processor type or how the heat sink locks down on it but i d bet dollars to donuts that you don t have good contact between the two </s>
<s> those cheesy plastic 1 4 turn locking mounts are the worst if that s what you have </s>
<s> you need the thermal compound evenly spread </s>
<s> no gaps </s>
<s> and you need the heat sink flush across the entire cpu with all mounts exerting even pressure </s>
<s> if one mount pops up heat transfer is severely compromised </s>
<s> on top of steven reply you need to check these areas of concern </s>
<s> applying compound need not be too much </s>
<s> also the cpu surface should be 100 cleaned before application </s>
<s> smear the compound out and then re attach the hsf to it </s>
<s> as explained by steven if applied wrong or at a slight angle etc it may not have full contact </s>
<s> any ducting is in place as it should be </s>
<s> any wiring fan or sensor re connected etc also don t over tighten screws as well </s>
<s> since you know its related to the previous work you did it needs to be rechecked </s>
<s> see link below for instructions tada willy </s>
