<s> i was hoping perhaps someone here could help me </s>
<s> i recently was given a nice 20 inch monitor by a guy who was going to a flatscreen and didn t have space in his apartment for the older monitor </s>
<s> he was running it on a mac with an adapter which had dip switches </s>
<s> from what i ve found out i think this is so you can run an ibm monitor on a mac not sure </s>
<s> the cable ended in rgb and the black sync wire </s>
<s> after a little digging i was able to buy a vga cord that had the four outputs </s>
<s> however i tried to connect it and the monitor looks all scrambled </s>
<s> i checked the inputs and they re all set </s>
<s> my computer is a p3 500 running with a voodoo3 3000 card </s>
<s> there are no distinguishing marks on the monitor to tell me who makes it or what model it is </s>
<s> there s a serial 1894470020 with a small dm subscript underneath on the back </s>
<s> digital machines </s>
<s> the controls on the bottom of the monitor are v stat h stat v cent brightness contrast power </s>
<s> i m hoping to find out what make model this monitor is and what the refresh resolution and such should be </s>
<s> there s a utility where i can change the refresh of my video card </s>
<s> it might only work for windows but that s all i work in anyway i can stand it garbling until windows boots </s>
<s> if i have to i ll see about getting a gemini card for fixed frequency monitors but i d rather not if i can avoid it </s>
<s> i ve included links to some quick pictures i took of the monitor as well as the adapter for the mac in case that d jog anyone memory </s>
<s> thanks for your help in advance </s>
<s> one of the usual sun computer monitors </s>
<s> almost impossible to get working with vga cards on pcs </s>
<s> best sold off to someone who will exclaim quot i ll try to make it work quot bob </s>
<s> try for clues </s>
<s> you can query them or supply your pictures to them for thier input if they so inclined </s>
<s> they provide adapters as well just anything for monitors </s>
<s> another possibl help for adapters is they are helpful but they only go so far with monitors </s>

<s> hi i work on monitors </s>
<s> one of best ways to find out whose monitor you have is to make sure the ac power is unpluged and take the back off the monitor </s>
<s> inside on the cover or on the bottom or top of the circuit bds </s>
<s> you may find model or company information </s>
<s> the information may be for the oem that made the unit or the company that distribute it </s>
<s> use these numbers or the fcc number and go to fcc website and they will tell who manufactured or distributed the unit </s>
<s> by going to the manufacturer or distributor you will find out how the unit accepts it signal </s>
<s> the problems with what you say on the monitor may be caused by the way the cable was wired and the ground and hot wires of the individual plugs could be reversed </s>
<s> if the screen has wide horzontal or slanted bars from left to right the horizontal frequency may be incorrect </s>
<s> if the picture rolls from top to bottom or reverse bottom to top the vertical frequency is off </s>
<s> you may need to use another monitor and see what your monitor card is putting out for the vertical some allow you to have different vertial frequencies for different resolutions </s>
<s> most monitor display adaptors do not allow any change in the horizontal frequency and may require you to change the resolution from xga to svga or vga </s>
<s> most monitors will allow you to use vga but i did come across one sony monitor that would only work with syn on one color and only 1 resolution it turned out to be from a unix workstation with xga resolution only </s>
<s> in windows the resolution just before opening windows is vga and the resolution once windows is open you determine by the setting the display in control panel </s>
<s> i also have a cross reference for many monitors i used to display pictures while repairing monitors and i could key in almost any resolution along with pixels both vertical and horizontal and a universal adaptor that would allow me to wire the cable any way i chose </s>
<s> but i always had to be careful how i wired the syn pulses since that could destroy the monitor if no careful </s>
<s> fell free to wire me about the monitor i will try and help </s>
