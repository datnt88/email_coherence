<s> hi there everyone this is my first post so bear with me if i mess up i m sure many of you have heard that plenty of times before lol anyways i m planning on building a new computer and i want to get a nvidia geforce 9800 gtx graphics card </s>
<s> i know it s a two slot card and i know that i only need 1 pci express 2 0 slot to use it but i don t know whether or not there needs to be a second pci slot next to it for it to rest on </s>
<s> if it does will the motherboard i m getting work </s>
<s> i want to get an asus p5ql em intel g43 socket 775 motherboard from tigerdirect com </s>
<s> if you need any more info just ask </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> you are right that it only needs one pci 2 0 express slot to use </s>
<s> abut you dont neccessarily need any slot for the second space it takes up </s>
<s> while it doesn t need a second pci slot it does at least need space available to be in </s>
<s> so it doesn t need the second slot but it will still take up all the space in that second slot making it so you can t use it for anything else </s>
