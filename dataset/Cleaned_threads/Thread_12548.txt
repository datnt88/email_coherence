<s> just set up a typical 2 pc home network a desktop a laptop both pcs running vista printer is local to desktop shared successfully found added the shared printer on the laptop system problem when sending a single test document from the laptop the print queue which started w zero documents now shows a count of 2 documents but only the job i sent is listed in the pending documents and that job never prints on the desktop side no pending documents are listed however when i print from the desktop the job shows up briefly on the laptop queue as it should if i cancel the test document on the laptop a count of 1 still remains on the print queue but no documents are in the list what am i missing </s>
<s> big thanks to anyone that can help </s>
<s> msft see google tends to call these issues cosmetic as the system works but does what you wrote about </s>
<s> since it works the printer prints they may leave such a bug unfixed </s>
<s> this can upset those that have no history with msft </s>
<s> ok one idea </s>
<s> manually clear the print queue </s>
<s> here s a google on that </s>
<s> but my thought is if it is printing why fix this </s>

<s> hi bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> i did clear the queue cancel the document manually </s>
<s> upon doing so i noted that the printer status window still showed that there was quot 1 quot document although none listed in the queue </s>
<s> it appears to me that the os is creating something that is put quot first in line quot before my document ultimately my document never printed from the laptop </s>
<s> no problems printing from the desktop i hope my attempt at this clarification is helpful </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> uninstall the printer entirely and make a new instance </s>
<s> again a msft issue </s>
<s> they really need to make this stuff better </s>
