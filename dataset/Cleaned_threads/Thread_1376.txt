<s> hello i ve been looking at 3 computers one is a sony viao the other one is a systemax and the the 3rd one is a v2 premier </s>
<s> can anyone tell me something about these or give me some advice please so i don t make a major mistake for the second time </s>
<s> thanks sky </s>
<s> my experience with sony support on a dozen office laptops has me writing that sony needs some serious whacks around the head about after sale support </s>
<s> out of the 12 6 died immediately and we spent untold hours shipping and on the phone about the units </s>
<s> in the end the sony story was these were not suitable units to be placed on a business desktop for use during the day </s>
<s> in otherwords you should only use them for an hour or two at a time </s>
<s> nothing in any printed literature noted such a limitation but it may have been true since we could only manage to eek usage out of the units by having the users shutdown during lunch </s>
<s> another issue with a sony is they pretty much treat it like a tv </s>
<s> if you change the os or add a device the support vanishes </s>
<s> while this can be true with other vendors sony seems to be more extreme with this </s>
<s> as to the other makes such are clones and one would have to rip off the lid and survey what s inside to tell </s>
<s> why not a dell hp </s>

<s> thanks for the info and the warnings i am now looking at a dell pentium 4 2 6 ghz 533 mhz 512 kb front side bus l2 cache intel 845 gu chipset 16x max dvd w software decoding dvd rw r w cd rw 3 5 diskette drive 512 mb sshared single channel ddr 333 mhz sdram 4 dimm slots and a 120 gb hard drive </s>

<s> thanks sky </s>
<s> 1 the dvd recorder is not of current technology </s>
<s> the non multi format dvd r w or dvd r w drives are going for abotu 69 bucks retail </s>

<s> 2 </s>
<s> 2 000 </s>
<s> is that cnd canadian </s>
<s> for 2 000 you should be able to do better </s>
<s> keep the money in your wallet and keep shopping </s>
<s> don t accept a dvd recorder of a single format and especially without dvd authoring software </s>
<s> additionally windows movie maker does not qualify as good dvd software </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i don t know exactly what it is you are looking for in a home computer but this looks like it should work for what you seem to be looking for but you have buy a seperate monitor and speakers but it will still end up cheaper than 2 000 here is what i think might work for you there are other desktops on that website too </s>
<s> good luck </s>
