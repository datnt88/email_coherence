<s> my dell desktop is 7 years old and and laptop is 5 i ve been storing backup data on discs i try to remember to do this every month and i make 2 copies </s>
<s> i m afraid of one of these machines suddenly quot dying quot and taking all of my records with it </s>
<s> but most of the info that i backup is retrievable from other sources go ahead and laugh but i still keep paper copies of my business files so if i lost them it would be a lot of work but i would be able to get everything back into a new computer system </s>
<s> however i bought a digital camera several months ago </s>
<s> i have been keeping all of the photos on discs but i read that after a few years discs can become unstable and the photos may be lost </s>
<s> so should i get an external hard drive to store the photos on </s>
<s> so far i ve taken about 2 000 photos and these are taking up a lot of space on my laptop </s>
<s> how do i store them safely and for an extended period </s>
<s> and should i also be storing my business files on an external hard drive </s>
<s> i was researching brands and several reviews mentioned that the user plugged in the external hd one day and it just didn t work </s>
<s> this happened with a few different brands and i m wondering what happens in that case </s>
<s> is the information remain retrievable such as the thousands of photos or would all be lost </s>
<s> i apologize for sounding so quot scattered quot </s>
<s> although i am relatively comfortable with my computers and how they work it has taken me years to be so </s>
<s> any problems just put me into panic mode </s>
<s> i would appreciate any help that anyone can give me </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> to cds or better dvds </s>
<s> if you don t have one you could add on to the desktop or get a usb external dvd writer </s>
<s> what are you backing up to now </s>
<s> vapcmd external hdds are not reliable for single source data storage </s>
<s> having read the posts in storage that should be pretty obvious </s>
<s> to store photos documents etc </s>
<s> but i thought that an external hard drive would be a better solution </s>
<s> quot external hdds are not reliable for single source data storage </s>
<s> having read the posts in storage that should be pretty obvious quot yes that s why i posted here as i am now completely unsure how to keep my digital photos and documents quot safe quot </s>
<s> now would using a dvd be a better option that a cd r or an ext hard drive </s>
<s> because they hold more data per disc 4 7gbs or 8 4gbs for dual layer dvds </s>
<s> just keep in mind the issue for hdds is susceptability to media damage electronic component failure mechanical failure malware damage or even operator error </s>
<s> whatever you have on an hdd that you don t want to lose should be backed up to something else the less susceptible the media is to damage or overwriting the safer you are </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i highly recommend an external hard drive </s>
<s> i have an internal hard drive that is hooked up to an external case and i love it </s>
<s> it s 160 g and twice a month i just plug in the usb cable and back up every thing </s>
<s> i keep two copies and over write the earlier one each time so i always have the two latest back ups </s>
<s> great deals on ebay </s>
<s> external hard drives are ok but there not as good as a burnt cd or dvd </s>
<s> a hard drive can fail more often than burnt media </s>
<s> if your really worried about your data on disk s becoming unstable than your not storing it properly </s>
<s> keep backed up disks in their own jewel case no stacking dark covers help don t expose them to light for long periods of time low humidity moisture etc </s>
<s> duplicate copies do exactly what you want double your chances of saving valuable files </s>
<s> the only thing hard drive related i can think of for semi safe storage is raid 0 1 which requires 4 hard drives spanned and mirrored </s>
<s> to everyone who answered </s>
<s> judging from what i ve read i will choose to store all of the photos on dvds making three copies of each following safe storage practices in three locations </s>
<s> and because i have my grandmother s photo albums which contain decent quality photos from as far back as the 1860 s i will also print what i consider quot irreplaceable quot photos and store them in archive quality sleeves in albums </s>
