<s> my college has a network their dhcp will allot us a xx xx 67 xx ip wifi i found that in their lab they use a different proxy that is restricted for our ip range squid xx xx 1 xx is their ip range </s>
<s> when i am manually configure my network interface to their ip range it doesn t ping to the both proxy but in default dhcp i can ping both </s>
<s> is there any emulators that can emulate my ip address to their range of ip </s>
<s> so that i can fool squid </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> it would help knowing what you are trying to achieve but your college network is likely designed to keep the student network distinctly separate from the classroom network </s>
<s> there is no emulator that would fool this system of security </s>
<s> you would need to contact the network administrator if you need access to those lab resources </s>
<s> if you want to use an ip nothing stopped you from setting such manually on almost any pc to date </s>
<s> so no fooling required </s>
