<s> i a buying a new pc </s>
<s> planning to do a lot of gaming on it </s>
<s> is a creative audio x fi pci card worth 79 </s>
<s> thank you for your help </s>
<s> though i will not be at my pc for a while and may not respond </s>
<s> while i didn t hear much difference in the headphones the recording was stellar compared to almost every onboard sound system i ve tried </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> and in fact i use the x fi fidelity with creative speakers </s>
<s> very satisfied </s>
<s> comes with some fairly good software as well </s>
<s> x fi has lower cpu usage which means higher framerates in games and it sounds much better than built in sound </s>
<s> creative s eax implementation is way better than most built in stuff so you ll hear sounds clearer with better directional placing and great environmental effects </s>
<s> good sound card cheap speakers wasted time and effort </s>
<s> would it be worth having a 2 1 audio system with it </s>
<s> if so what would be best for the money </s>
<s> see </s>
