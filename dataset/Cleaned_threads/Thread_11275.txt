<s> ok i have a vivo nvidia agp 8x card i dont want to toss </s>
<s> and i want to upgrade to the good stuff and i want to use my vivo for tv as well and recording tv wile i work </s>
<s> but i want to play the new games and the power of this card is outdated hell it barely lets me play wow at near max </s>
<s> i want to build a system with both pcie and agp slots and use my old card instead of tossing it </s>
<s> so is this a possibility </s>
<s> please assist if u can </s>
<s> get a motherboard that can take both an agp a pcie card </s>
<s> you can choose to do more research on this if you like </s>
<s> the first thing might be to see if such board s exist </s>
<s> you d have to check whether you can use both at the same time </s>
<s> check out the asrock motherboards </s>
<s> let us know </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> all produced boards with both agp and pci express they are almost all exclusively based on the via pt880 series of chipsets and usually offer a pcie x16 mechanical slot which is only wired for x4 transfers </s>
<s> i would suggest considering a tv tuner board in addition to your new pci express board instead of spending a great deal of time and money looking for a fairly proprietary motherboard design especially as the pt880 is no longer a new chipset which causes some problems for future upgrades </s>
<s> asrock at a time produced an amd motherboard which offered pci express x16 full x16 transfers and agp 8x full speed as well based on a uli solution however this board is notoriously hard to find especially now that uli is part of nvidia </s>
<s> additionally this board was designed for socket 939 socket am2 could be ammended to it through means of a proprietary add in board which is usually even harder to find </s>
<s> the setup actually work fairly well it was just very hard to find available for purchase </s>
<s> i know that at one time newegg sold the board however i m doubting if they still do </s>
<s> well all i want to do is use agp and pcie cards thats it not anything fancy just dont want to toss my old card since it works fine i could care less about a mb with bult in crap i wouldnt buy anyway cause bult in meens not upgradable </s>
<s> not that you cant hook a newer tv tuner into that mb </s>
<s> and who knows maybe the mb will be dumb and fight the new card </s>
<s> all i wanted to know was plainly this do the new generation mb still fight for video dominece between ports </s>
<s> example back int he day if you had onboard video and a new vid card if you didnt disable the on board the pc tried to feed bits of into to both video sources </s>
<s> so you were forced to disable onboard video </s>
<s> but will 2 video cards nowadays do the same retardation or have we leaped forward from this glitch and i dont know steped forward in pc intelegence me am just want use 2 vid cards agp tvtuner and pcie new purdy stuff can u am answer me rationaly internet world people </s>
<s> motherboards with an agp and pcie slots are not available </s>
