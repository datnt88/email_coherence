<s> ok heres the situation every time i go to rebuild my machine it fails out on copying files from any windows bootable cd windows xp 2000 and longhorn_beta </s>
<s> the point is the machine gets to copying system files and then goes bad either a single file or a blue screen </s>
<s> i ve swapped the hdd and the cd s and i even took the hdd and cd and they installed fine on an older box i have </s>
<s> please i need any suggestion on what to do now oh i have also reseated the memory ide cables and changed cd rom drives </s>
<s> the only thing i haven t done yet was reseat the cpu i hate having to move those things </s>
<s> the machine is also rather dusty i just want this thing to work any help greatly welcome </s>
<s> thanks ray </s>
<s> my usual list 1 big whopping power supply </s>
<s> no mention of your complete machine parts list but i often just pop in a 450 watt psu and try again </s>
<s> 2 set the fsb a bios setting from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 mhz </s>
<s> beats crashing and hair loss 3 pull the case cover point a fan at the internals </s>
<s> 4 just one stick of ram </s>
<s> then try another stick </s>
<s> don t not count that the ram works in another machine </s>
<s> needs to work in this machine </s>
<s> best of luck bob </s>
<s> thanks alot bob i m going to have to changes the power supply i just bought a 300w and didn t think anything of it i ll check the other settings thanks for your time </s>
<s> ray </s>
<s> try the other settings since it quot lightens the load quot amd s tend to take big gulps of power and these tend to curb that appetite </s>
<s> can help in the pinch </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m looking at the motherboard now and i m going to look up the power specs online i hope i can change the settings thanks again </s>
<s> i like to add to what robert suggested if the problem crops up under 3 different os installs i would look at more memory check ram or yet another cd drive </s>
<s> i assume the os cds are legit and not copies which can introduce problems also </s>
<s> or you maybe better off doing a fresh install if you re upgrading or reloading or trying a dual mode install with win9x etc maybe also the h w just is too old as xp or even w2k become picky on that issue </s>
<s> you just can t take anything for granted </s>
<s> willy </s>
<s> i had a similar problem it was the cpu overheating while installing 98se </s>
<s> make sure your cpu fan heatsink is clean and running if it is very old you might try a new fan heatsink </s>
<s> ken </s>
<s> that might be the problem i have an athlon k7 1 2 gig chip on a k7sem board and i took it all apart last night and the heatsink was mighty dirty i removed the fan from the top and cleaned it out the best i could i reseated the cpu and heatsink and cleaned the fan there is another fan in the box so air flow shouldn t be an issue </s>
<s> i m going to go get my legit cd s and try again i can t give up oh and btw the memory chip is 512ddr pc 133 it should work fine it did in my other machine </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> the chip is rather new and unused 512ddr sdram pc 133 and the cd rom was swapped i cleaned some dust out of the heat sink and fan and i m taking my perfectly legit cd s and going to try again tonight wish me luck </s>
