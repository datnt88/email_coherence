<s> the model is a wd caviar se16 500gb i checked out the page on there site and downloaded a data lifeguard program but it said it was incompatible with vista </s>
<s> quot the dos version is required if installing a hard drive in a new system without existing operating system support quot we can use that since you might have vista 64 bit do you </s>
<s> you may have to change a bios setting to enable booting from cd or even emulate ide over sata but this is their test tool </s>
<s> shows this version </s>
<s> there is also some confusion where a person does not try the windows version on vista 32 bit </s>
<s> i found that to work fine </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the nice thing about the free version of s free version is that it won t let you do anything dangerous </s>
<s> on some drive controller configurations it won t display the smart attributes but the error scan will simply read the entire drive at the sector level </s>
<s> it will take over an hour to check a 500gb drive but even one red box is notice of impending failure and i recommend running it about once a year for safety </s>
<s> i ll tryout hdtune davis </s>
<s> thanks bob for trying to help me out too </s>
<s> htttp vapcmd </s>
<s> i want to get a second opinion from there program but don t understand how to use it </s>
<s> i am running 64bit vista </s>
<s> nwcdex was the mscdex equivalent from dr dos </s>
<s> but now i read it is part of partition magic </s>
<s> but it had to do with mounting and reading a cd in dos </s>
<s> so please tell more </s>
<s> what program do you mean </s>
<s> what do you want to do with it </s>
<s> and a link to releevant info like a manual if possible on the internet please </s>
<s> on the dos screen it says nwcdex exe needs me to specify a driver name </s>
<s> the program i was trying to use is called data lifeguard tools from western digital the windows version didn t work so i was going to try the dos but there seems to be a problem running this too </s>
<s> here is a link to there page </s>
<s> i was trying to install the wrong tool </s>
<s> what i needed was the diagnostics program it installed without a problem </s>
<s> i can be so silly at times </s>
<s> thanks everybody for helping me out and sorry for wasting time </s>

<s> grc s spinrite is the best disk tool there is for surface and read write errors </s>
<s> it costs 80 bucks but it s worth it for all it does </s>
<s> i would like to thank all you guys for your postings i had no idea such utilities existed i had a problem with my hd few weeks ago where the error message said quot no operating system installed quot i have since got the drive working again at the cost of losing all my photo s etc and although i had backed up with cd i had still lost a great deal that i had not had time to back up </s>
<s> having downloaded the freebie suggested i find my hd is in good health and no i will not download a reg cleaner again as i think this caused the problem o manny </s>
<s> if you re hearing squeeking from a hd it s not scraping from the surface </s>
<s> hd platter surfaces are extremly sensitive if the heads crashed on a platter it d likely ruin the entire drive </s>
<s> to check a drive right click the drive icon click on properties then on the tools tab </s>
<s> click on error checking to test for bad sectors and other problems </s>
<s> as you now know there s more extensive checking programs but you were concernend about surface damage and this ll check for that </s>
<s> hard drive noise is a sure sign of a problem </s>
<s> i d suggest you replace it and in a hurry </s>
