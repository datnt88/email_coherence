<s> i have optiarc dvd rw ad 7170s and it is only reading dvd rewritables </s>
<s> i am using my video editing program premier elements 7 i tried burning taiyo yuden dvd and doesn t burn </s>
<s> they used to work on that program </s>
<s> i just updated the dvd driver of 1 3 version instead of old version of 1 00 why is my dvd drives only burning rewritables rw and not taiyo uden and other dvd anymore is there away to change the settings </s>
<s> cause i heard taiyo yuden are a great quality brand of dvd i used them for my customers but now can t use them only rewritables rw </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> did you try a new dvdrw drive </s>
<s> that s how i see if the problem is the aging drive or some software setting </s>
<s> yeah i have 3 other drives and tried all of them is there a setting that i change in the optiarc 7170s to do dvd and and not just rewritables i emailed optiarc just now i am just hearing a respons efrom tghem possibly tomororw </s>
<s> batches of media </s>
<s> if other media works you have proved this batch is not good for these drives </s>
<s> rare but it happens </s>
<s> as to the setting </s>
<s> after years of pc repairs i have yet to see such </s>
<s> but i do see failed drives daily </s>
<s> and owners that don t want to change the drive but want it fixed </s>
<s> swapping the drive for a demo seems to only make them think we want to sell them a drive </s>
<s> someday i ll find an easier way to get the old drive out and a new working one to them without all the haggling </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i agree with robert on many a cd dvd drive issue when they don t burn r w in some fashion </s>
<s> my question is quot why did you update the firmware in the 1st place quot </s>
<s> if it was to correct this problem or did you do it because it was there </s>
<s> if it ain t broke don t fix it is a highly wise decision for repair people </s>
<s> in my experience as well it s far simpler and quicker to replace the problem drive with new or known good one in order to proceed </s>
<s> the time and effort spend becomes practical then </s>
<s> understand wera tear on drives become evident when used over a yr or alot and newer drives aren t made as good as they used to simply cheaper </s>
<s> as noted the media itself if using some off brand bulk can be very unforgiving </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
