<s> xp home sp 2 gateway notebook with built in wireless </s>
<s> home network let s call it sm </s>
<s> verizon wireless dsl router with three computers hooked into sm </s>
<s> one is a dell no problem there the other is ethernet connected vista home premium and the gateway xp home sp2 seems to be constantly losing the wireless signal to a signal named bl </s>
<s> this bl signal apparently is overbearing and overpowering the gateway </s>
<s> i had made our little home network called sm a wep security system and changed the radio frequency to 11 but this bl s signal still interferes with gateway </s>
<s> any simple solutions suggested </s>
<s> would another frequency help </s>
<s> if yes which frequency </s>
<s> since we went to channel 11 to get away from this problem a few months ago with another interfering signal </s>
<s> thanks in advance robert </s>
<s> change channels again and wep is dead </s>
<s> we tell why in our forum sticky </s>
<s> sorry but i gotta run and wanted you to have something to work with </s>
<s> oops i meant that we use wpa psk as a security feature for wireless </s>
<s> what that being understood what next to make sure we do not get interference from bl </s>
<s> thanks r </s>
<s> changed to channel 6 from 11 let s see what happens thanks r </s>
