<s> from yahoo answers not my question </s>
<s> quot you may be a bit dismayed with the internal expansion option </s>
<s> while the e310 has two pci slots and a single pci express x1 slot it lacks a dedicated x16 pci express slot for graphics cards </s>
<s> the integrated intel gma 950 graphics of the 915g chipset are your only option </s>
<s> the combination of midrange cpus with a lack of video card options means the dimension e310 won t do much for you as a gaming system </s>
<s> frame rates were too low to run half life 2 although older games such as unreal tournament 2004 should run at lower resolutions </s>
<s> you could possibly increase the 256 megs of ram that it came with </s>
<s> that s the way the big manufacturers are </s>
<s> they will sell you something knowing very well that it is going to need upgrading in a year to three and since theirs aren t a lot upgradeable they expect you to purchase a new one quot </s>
<s> the e310 lacks a pci express x16 graphics slot and thus you can t add a decent gaming video card to it </s>
<s> cannot add a decent video to your existing system </s>
