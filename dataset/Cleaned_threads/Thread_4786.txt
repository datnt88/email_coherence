<s> i have an hp pavilion 8750c upgraded to 512 ram just upgraded from win98se to windows xp home ed and have an nec multisync fe700 monitor </s>
<s> it started just before upgrading to the extra ram and win xp when i turn my system on what i see on the screen comes up expanded ie oversized spread out so to speak then sometimes normal </s>
<s> after doing the upgrades it now comes up expanded all the time </s>
<s> i have gone into control panel and checked the quot sizing quot and it is all correct i can only get the screen to fit my monitor if i go into the monitor controls and shrink it as much as i can there </s>
<s> i lean towards thinking it is the monitor but could use some advice </s>
<s> i have alwasy gotten great help here thanks in advance </s>
<s> microsoft doesn t do this for us and i can t know what video card driver you need since such was not revealed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it sounds as if you need to need two things besides the latest video card drivers </s>
<s> you should see if your monitor is correctly detected by brand model </s>
<s> if not a driver might be available </s>
<s> this just defines your monitor s capabilities </s>
<s> next you have some display settings including resolution and refresh that are switched to during the process of loading windows </s>
<s> these are not valid until this occurs and the signals sent to your monitor </s>
<s> in the meantime your monitor is using some internal defaults </s>
<s> you need to adjust these using the monitor settings and not the display settings within windows </s>
<s> you may need to boot to a command prompt for basic settings by displaying a text window </s>
<s> there may even be an intermediate setting and you may hear clicking within the monitor as settings change </s>
<s> if you have some sort of a utility that boots from a floppy such as a disk utility boot that up and adjust your monitor to properly display those as well </s>
<s> new monitors almost invariably need adjustments for different screens and one adjustment should not mess things up for another </s>
<s> the monitor remembers these </s>
<s> hey guys </s>
<s> i had this same computer and from day one </s>
<s> i had problems </s>
<s> the computer froze </s>
<s> and from that day i had problems </s>
<s> i bought it in 2000 and i had to replace it in 2003 so for 3 years i had a freezing problem </s>
<s> for no reason the computer froze </s>
<s> it wasnt until aafter 3 years that i saw an article from another pavilion 8750c user that they had the same problem </s>
<s> it was a problem with the video card </s>
<s> and he had changed the video card and had no problem </s>
<s> i was mad </s>
<s> i carried the computer to like three places including the store i bought it from circuit city </s>
<s> and they could find nothing wrong with it </s>
<s> i could not believe it </s>
<s> hp was no help at all </s>
<s> this computer most likely froze well over 1000 times and up to this day i can not turn on for no reason </s>
<s> when i mean freeze i mean the computer is totaly frozen </s>
<s> nothing responds </s>
<s> the only way to bring the computer back to normal was to manually turn the computer off </s>
<s> arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i hated hp for that </s>
<s> i was mad </s>
<s> does anybody who has this computer had aor still has a freezing problem </s>
<s> did hp do a recall of the computer i need to know </s>
<s> i want my momey back </s>
<s> please respond back </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> read the above posts </s>
<s> probably why or you had spyware adaware of which hp is not responsible </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> it wasnt spyware </s>
<s> it was something to do with hardware </s>
<s> i got the net a little ways after i had the computer </s>
<s> and before the net the computer froze constantly </s>
<s> and just returned it for another machine and if the problem persists maybe classaction lawsuit if you re smart </s>
<s> or just get a refund and another machine </s>
<s> don t dwell in the past </s>
<s> most computers come with outdated drivers it could ve been something like modem drivers keyboard drivers bad memory run memtest just a defective machine in the batch </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> well when we thought about using the warrenty </s>
<s> it was kinda laate </s>
<s> and we had to travel from nassau bahamas to florida </s>
<s> so it was kinda costly </s>
<s> we already made two trips to get it repaired </s>
<s> so we kinda made up our mind that we wont get another hp </s>
<s> we will just stick to hp printers and scanners or at least i wanted too </s>
