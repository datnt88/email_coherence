<s> hi everyone i have a plextor px 712a drive </s>
<s> it does not read some dvd roms which other drives are able to read </s>
<s> when i insert that dvd rom in the drive the drives led blinks with an orange colour orange colour usually indicates that there is some problem with the disc </s>
<s> the discs are fine as they have not much scratches on them </s>
<s> some people told me to clean the lens using a lens cleaner cd </s>
<s> i used it but it didnt work </s>
<s> my system info is 1ghz intel celeron windows xp professional 256mb ram 40 gb harddisk dvd burner px 712a </s>
<s> what should i do </s>
<s> your suggessions are highly appreciated </s>
<s> let me add one thing to the above initiated discussion that when i insert the disc for the first time the drive does not read the disc by blinking the led but then after i insert it three four times again at last the drive starts reading the disc </s>
<s> but this is true only for some discs but others are not read by it even on repeated insertions </s>
<s> need more info </s>
<s> what os what type of pc how old is drive does it read any disks at all </s>
<s> thanks paul </s>
<s> didn t see your info the first time however does it read any disks at all </s>
<s> thanks again paul </s>
<s> it reads all the cds but when it comes to dvds it reads only some </s>
<s> it reads some others when inserted for the fifth or sixth time </s>
<s> what you are saying is it reads most cds and not certain dvds </s>
<s> i noticed you said the disks are fine not quot many quot scratches </s>
<s> dvds are a fussy disk </s>
<s> i have many dvds and let me say one scratch in the wrong spot will keep it from playing in my dvd drives as well or takes a few times to open them </s>
<s> some drives will play a scratched dvd while others can be a bit more fussy </s>
<s> most of my old cds that are scratched badly still play with ease </s>
<s> this has to do with the format of the disk also </s>
<s> since the format of a dvd is well let s just say more condensed for now it is also vulnerable to lighter scratches as the laser spreads even a bit and is unfocused the dvd will skip not play right away or at all </s>
<s> cds are not so once again just for purpose sake condensed and have a slightly better range for margin of error </s>
<s> this is currently my take on your problem but others may have another idea </s>
<s> i just feel if it was in fact the player it wouldn t work at all </s>
<s> also it may be the software you use </s>
<s> some won t play certain regions as to where some play more </s>
<s> this is my take on it </s>
<s> others may have other suggestions but i do feel this is what s happening </s>
<s> take care paul </s>
