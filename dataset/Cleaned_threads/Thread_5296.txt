<s> buying a new pc will i regret the integrated graphics card later </s>
<s> it s been a long time since i ve bought a new pc and i m ready to take the plunge for a new one </s>
<s> however my concern is that the hp windows 7 system from costco that i have in mind has an integrated video card with 256mb shared memory but i m not too sure what that exactly means </s>
<s> are there ones that are not integrated </s>
<s> it seems like 256mb size for a graphic card is pretty hefty but will it be enough to handle some of the newer games especially the ones that are more graphic intensive </s>
<s> i m not an avid gamer but i would like to have the option to play those games when the opportunity arises </s>
<s> if i find that the graphic card isn t up to snuff can i upgrade or add more memory to the 256mb graphic card </s>
<s> or would i be stuck having this system that will never play those graphic intensive games </s>
<s> i would go for a more expensive system but i m currently on a very limited budget and that hp system seems like the way to go but i don t want to regret buying it </s>
<s> please help any advice is appreciated </s>

<s> thank you </s>
<s> the integrated graphics chip on the new will be far faster than what you have in your old pc </s>
<s> if you are unhappy with the performance of the new pc you may always add a graphics card later </s>
<s> if the integrated graphics uses 256 meg of the pcs memory make sure the new pc has at least preferably 4 or more gig </s>
<s> ideally the motherboard should allow you to upgrade to at least 8 gb </s>
<s> integrated graphics cards are not for gamers </s>
<s> they will only handle the basic gui of windows </s>
<s> they will be able to play games though older ones that aren t as graphically intensive as new games </s>
<s> if you do want to play new modern games from 2007 onwards you will need to buy a graphics card </s>
<s> most if not all of them go into the pci slot on your motherboard and handle all graphics on the computer </s>
<s> think of having two hands </s>
<s> two hands can type a document on a computer with ease </s>
<s> if you tell those two hands to type on a computer and draw a picture it will be able to do both but much slower and with sub par results </s>
<s> think of getting a graphics card as getting an extra five pairs of hands </s>
<s> the two original ones will still be typing a document but the ten extra ones can be drawing you a magnificent picture </s>
<s> there is a lot more to consider besides the amount of ram dedicated to integrated graphics </s>
<s> most onboard gpu s would not make good gaming machines </s>
<s> be sure that the machine you buy has a dedicated slot for an add on card </s>
<s> if you find the onboard graphics are not up to snuff it is a simple matter of adding a dedicated card and disabling the onboard graphics </s>
<s> most newer motherboards will see the new card if not you may have to go to the bios and disable there </s>
<s> i would recommend at least 512 megs of ram for a dedicated card and doing a bit of research </s>
<s> the biggest makers are ati and nvidia </s>
<s> both have good lower priced cards but nvidia drivers seems to support games developed with open gl better than ati so this is something to consider </s>
<s> first of all you asked two separate questions </s>
<s> the answer to the first is that shared memory means that the on board graphics card shares memory with the system ram </s>
<s> for example if you have 2gb of ram and the graphics card uses 256mb of shared memory then 256 mb of the system ram is used for the graphics card and subsequently the usable system ram for applications is reduced by that amount to 1 75 gb </s>
<s> the second question asks whether the integrated graphics card is quot up to snuff quot </s>
<s> this depends on several factors including the onboard graphics chipset and the quality of the drivers </s>
<s> for most applications the onboard graphics card will perform well </s>
<s> however for very graphic intense applications such as video editing and high performance gaming you would probably want to update to a dedicated video card with a better graphics processor and drivers and possibly more memory such as those from ati and nvidia </s>
<s> this will also free up the 256mb of shared memory for applications to use </s>
<s> if you plan on playing light moderate cpu taxing games such as flash games or web games then you can probably get away with an integrated graphics card with today s cpus </s>
<s> if however you are looking to play more graphically demanding games such as call of duty assassin s creed world of warcraft crysis etc </s>
<s> you definitely need a dedicated graphics card </s>
<s> the reason is integrated graphics rely more heavily on the cpu to make all the graphical calculations and renderings which can bog down the computer s overall performance </s>
<s> memory is also usually shared with the main memory which again can affect performance </s>
<s> a dedicated card has it s own dedicated gpu and memory which does all the video calcs and rendering which in turn frees up the cpu for other tasks </s>
<s> this creates a much more efficient system and gives a huge boost in overall performance especially with the more graphically demanding games </s>
<s> also if you do go with dedicated do it right </s>
<s> don t slouch on the quality of the dedicated graphics card s chipset </s>
<s> a low end older dedicated graphics card can be almost as bad as using the newer integrated graphics chipsets </s>
<s> i have built 3 pc s </s>
<s> i always thought i should buy the best graphics card i could find </s>
<s> then i decided to buy a complete pc from costco quad core w integrated card </s>
<s> i did add more memory and use additional external hard drives </s>
<s> i can t tell any difference </s>
<s> i don t play high graphics games </s>
<s> i am a retired grandmother my kids and grand kids can t tell any difference either </s>
<s> the bad news it wont run those graphic intensive games </s>
<s> it will most likely handle all the general tasks like email web surfing etc the good news as long as the motherboard in the system also has a pci or even better a pci express slot or even still better a pci express 2 0 slot available you can upgrade to a good graphics card in the future as a decent video card today at 200 300 dollars will a year from now be 60 125 dollars </s>
<s> i bought a new hp computer with the latest integrated graphics card a couple of years ago </s>
<s> it worked great until the graphic demands for the new games got bigger </s>
<s> i had a very fast cpu chip but the new grapics were beyond the capacity of the integrated graphics card </s>
<s> no problem i thought i will just buy a new graphics card and turn off the integrated chip </s>
<s> no dice </s>
<s> there was no slot on the mother board to fit a new grapics card inside the computer </s>
<s> i had no option other than buying a brand new computer </s>
<s> a computer i was sure could be expanded for future demands </s>
<s> the answer to your question if you re buying a laptop is pretty easy yes you re pretty much stuck with whatever graphics capability comes with it whether it is integrated or a separate chipset </s>
<s> laptops have very limited expandability </s>
<s> for a desktop the answer is more interesting </s>
<s> first off no you aren t limited to integrated graphics as long as you have one or two pci e slots and a decent power supply psu </s>
<s> you can add a gaming graphics card assuming that you have a roomy enough case take a look at the dimensions of an ati radeon 5850 for example good graphics cards generally only use one pci e slot but are double width </s>
<s> chances are when you do this you ll also have to upgrade the standard psu they re usually only in the 300w range </s>
<s> for example when i upgraded the graphics card in my dell desktop pc i also upgraded the psu to 650w since the stock psu was only 375w and lot of the graphics cards require about 500w </s>
<s> also i needed to make sure that i had space in the case for the graphics card that i was going to buy </s>
<s> cooling can also be a problem but most oem systems should be adequately cooled and the graphics cards all have built in fans as well </s>
<s> so within the above parameters yes you ll be able to upgrade your graphics capabilities if you get a decent pc with enough extra space to begin with </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> jose with regard to graphics processing units gpus there are generally two different types </s>
<s> one type like that in the computer you re considering has an integrated gpu </s>
<s> a useful way of thinking of integrated video cards is with the word shared an integrated card shares some of your computer s memory </s>
<s> so say that you have 2gb ram in your new pc 256mb of this is portioned out to the video card </s>
<s> the other type is a dedicated gpu </s>
<s> these are video cards designed to have their own memory some these days reaching 1gb </s>
<s> the advantage of this is that given their name they have their own dedicated memory and are generally designed to be much more powerful </s>
<s> it s difficult to give you full advice without knowing specifically what integrated card the pc uses </s>
<s> what i can say is that an integrated card will never give you the same graphics processing power as a dedicated one </s>
<s> because the dedicated cards have their own memory they are not sapping memory from your pc </s>
<s> consequentially games will run much more efficiently on a dedicated card </s>
<s> if you want to play more recent graphically intensive games an integrated card will only suffice if you turn all the settings down somewhat defeating the point of it being a recent graphically intensive game </s>
<s> remember that when you plug your monitor into the tower unit the connection is made at your graphics card </s>
<s> these things are not just for powering games if you re going to be watching high quality movies video or photo editing a more powerful dedicated graphics card will always put you in better stead and let you do more </s>
<s> the pure joy of a desktop is that generally speaking you re free to upgrade it whenever you want and upgrading ram sound cards graphics cards and the like is remarkably straightforward although note that some manufacturers consider user upgrades to be a breach of the warranty </s>
<s> a common misconception is that graphics cards cost the earth </s>
<s> yes the newest and most powerful ones do but plump for one of the better models from last year and you ll get great performance with plenty of bucks left over </s>
<s> before you do this you do need to check what type of motherboard you have and match this up to the cards available </s>
<s> but no if you plump for the cheaper option now it does not mean you ll be stuck playing solitaire for ever </s>
<s> i would not go with integrated graphics unless absolutely necessary </s>
<s> many of the newest games require 1 gb of graphic memory </s>
<s> if you think you are going to want to play games go with a graphic card that has 1 gb </s>
<s> or better </s>
<s> some avid gamers run two or four cards in the same computer </s>
<s> you don t have to have the latest greatest card either </s>
<s> it should not cost you a whole lot more to get a desktop with a pci express graphic card </s>
<s> the major limitation of the integrated video is not the 250mb memory but the processing power which will definitely not handle the latest games nor a good many older ones </s>
<s> if the computer has an empty pcie slot then you can add the video card of your choice at any time </s>
<s> there are just two things to check out 1 is there room for the particular card you want </s>
<s> some are quite long 2 some high end cards draw a lot of power so you should check that your power supply unit is adequate </s>
<s> i bought my computer with integrated graphics because the price was good </s>
<s> i used it for everything but games no problem </s>
<s> several months later i added an nvidia 9800gt card </s>
<s> this has been good for all the games i ve thrown at it so far </s>
<s> when i got my hp pc back in 2004 it was shipped in intergrated graphic card </s>
<s> i didn t know the meaning of it </s>
<s> due to my own curiosity i came to realize that having standalone graphic card is always better than having integrated one in term of performance </s>
<s> by having standalone graphic card the burden of cpu and the amount of ram that has been used will be reduced </s>
<s> gpu will take over the graphic processiong job and there would be dedicated memory for graphic so that your ram could be used for other tasks </s>
<s> if you don t use your pc for resource intensive job integrated graphic card will just do fine </s>
<s> before running softwares it s a good practice to check their system requirement </s>
<s> i m not a hardcore gamer </s>
<s> but i do use autocad adobe flash and photoshop </s>
<s> they do consume a lot of resources </s>
<s> assuming that you re talking about a desktop pc notebooks are another matter entirely you can absolutely upgrade to a better video card later on </s>
<s> integrated graphics systems with few exceptions offer the bare minimum user experience </s>
<s> they re okay for most typical household tasks and internet browsing and even for most business office uses but for an enjoyable multimedia or gaming experience you re probably going to want to upgrade to a faster card </s>
<s> fortunately all desktop systems include several expansion slots that can accommodate additional cards including one or two designed specifically for graphics cards </s>
<s> in new machines this will be a pci express slot </s>
<s> don t get suckered into buying an outdated machine with an agp slot instead </s>
<s> agp is an older technology on its way out and graphics cards that fit that standard are older slower and harder to come by </s>
<s> if and when you do install a new graphics card you can disable the integrated graphics in the computer s bios </s>
<s> even if bios tweaking is beyond you most computer systems will automatically detect the new card and direct resources to it instead </s>
<s> by the way 256mb isn t all that much memory when you re talking about today s games much less tomorrow s </s>
<s> plus that s 256mb of shared memory which means the graphics system doesn t have any memory of its own it s borrowing from the system ram to store all of its texture information </s>
<s> this is a very slow way of doing things even with fast system ram </s>
<s> you haven t told us much about that hp system that interests you but i m going to assume that the quot integrated graphics quot you are talking about comes in the form of the intel q57 express chipset that of late is being put on motherboards intended for use with core i3 and i5 processors </s>
<s> 256k video memory shared at that is not really all that much at all </s>
<s> the serious gamer cards lately come with 1 2gb of specialized graphics oriented silicon onboard quot gddrx quot but will also cost you typically 100 400 extra with exceptions on either end of that range </s>
<s> all reviews i have seen say the newest intel integrated graphics will play blu ray just fine but only fairly rudimentary games but also in fairness that intel never claims it ll do more than that </s>
<s> using integrated graphics for mostly playback entertainment should be fine </s>
<s> but if you want to play any kind of graphics demanding game you d better figure on an add on graphics card </s>
<s> and unless they are the most demanding games you should be able to get a very respectable card for under 200 </s>
<s> you just have to be clear with yourself about what you really want to do with the box and be prepared to pay for whatever that is </s>
<s> i recently bought a very current nvdia 220 based card with 1bg onboard for 65 which handles middle of the road graphics demands pretty well so the extra card doesn t have to break the bank </s>
<s> if you ve not looked in a while prices for graphics cards are down significantly in terms of bang for the buck </s>
<s> just be clear about what you want from your system and keep in mind that you can always add one in later if the rest of your system can handle the extra demands of higher end gaming it s not just the card that matters </s>
<s> nice comparison </s>
<s> and you are correct </s>
<s> i m an upper level novice son is a network pro so i know a little </s>
<s> the general rule is that quot discrete quot separate graphics cards are always better but add to your cost initially </s>
<s> in a laptop they can reduce your battery life they use power per cycle each recharge </s>
<s> in a desktop they can increase your game graphics ability significantly </s>
<s> 256 mb is pretty minimal for system ram as well as graphics ram as windows 7 needs that to run more than minimally and may or may not allow you to use the attractive aero vista gui the basic graphics of windows 7 upped one step </s>
<s> i recommend to a number of friends and co workers who rely on even my limited expertise as a non pro non gamer user 512 mb graphics to go with an i5 or higher processor to get more than quot adequate quot graphics performance </s>
<s> however an i3 or amd equivalent and 256 mb graphics even integrated will give decent color in most cases </s>
<s> i recommend at least 4 gb ram windows 7 or vista to support the processor and graphics card and give decent speed </s>
<s> you might want to check out hp s and dell s outlet pages </s>
<s> i ve had very good luck at getting good systems with near current components for significantly less money </s>
<s> that should last you adequately for at least the next 2 to 5 years if history continues as it has in computers moore s law </s>
<s> hope this helps without drowning you in the sea of technical data </s>
<s> a dedicated graphics card is necessary in one of four scenarios 1 you play games which are above and beyond web based ones or very old games </s>
<s> even older games will benefit with a basic dedicated graphics card </s>
<s> 2 you play high definition compressed video whether locally or on the internet including blu ray movies </s>
<s> an integrated graphics solution will be able to play high definition compressed video but it will likely cause the computer s cooling solutions to kick into high gear potentially causing a lot of noise </s>
<s> 3 you edit high definition videos or shoot dslr photos in raw </s>
<s> most newer video and image editing software packages can tap into the processing power of a dedicated graphics card to greatly reduce the time necessary to encode video apply effects and do real time previews </s>
<s> 4 you use some other program which either requires or gets a significant performance boost from a dedicated graphics solution </s>
<s> gpus are different types of processors than the main cpu in your computer and are not just game accelerators any more </s>
<s> programs above and beyond games and video editors are beginning to take advantage of gpus as they are more efficient than cpus in certain computing tasks </s>
<s> now with all this being said you don t have to run out and buy a monster graphics card like an ati radeon hd 5970 or an nvidia geforce gtx 480 in order to play games watch hd video or run a video editor </s>
<s> those graphics cards will do them quite well in fact they re the best available as of this post but they aren t necessary for everyone </s>
<s> a much more basic card such as an nvidia geforce gts 250 or ati radeon hd 5550 will handle any of the above tasks just fine while not costing as much as a new computer </s>
<s> they won t be able to handle the latest and greatest games with all the details at maximum and at the highest resolution but they will play most current games no problem </s>
<s> jose if your funds are limited you might consider purchasing the system with the integrated graphics but if you can wait a little longer or spend a little more up front buy a system with a separate graphics card instead </s>
<s> integrated graphics will never perform as well as a good system with an independent graphic card however you may add another graphics card to the system that you are considering at a later time </s>
<s> if you plan to play graphic intensive games don t waste your money buy a system with an independent graphic card </s>
<s> hope i was able to help </s>
<s> two key points in your question </s>
<s> gamer shared memory </s>
<s> shared memory is just that </s>
<s> the integrated card uses part of your ram for it s memory </s>
<s> if your a gamer a dedicated card is best way to go </s>
<s> while you could in most cases shut off the integrated video in the bios install a dedicated card low end machines may have limited expansion slots </s>
<s> if games you play don t require high resources you could be ok </s>
<s> before you go to costco and buy any national brand computer check out the small local computer stores in your area </s>
<s> if they are anything like my small local computer store and i m sure they are you will get a better computer and probably one with a discreet video card even a lower end video card is better that onboard in most cases and a better deal and let me stress this point local tech support </s>
<s> just think you have a problem or a question you call a local number and you don t get someone in a call center half way around the world giving you cookie cutter answers </s>
<s> but anyway get one with a discreet video card it s always better </s>
<s> replacing it with a video card </s>
<s> with this in mind you might wish to study up and look at prices to do that in the future </s>
<s> in fact you might build it into the price of the pc your buying </s>
<s> remember the prices of components goes down quick </s>
<s> hp has upgradable models and other features with those you can ge now </s>
<s> click here to see customize on this site message was edited by admin to edit link which was breaking the page on some browsers </s>
<s> integrated graphics cards are fine for surfing the internet or just doing casual computing however if you will be doing heavy graphics work with images or if you will be working with cad or such you should definitely consider purchasing a higher grade graphics card </s>
<s> also if you are an avid gamer you will probably want a separate graphics card with at least 128 gb of memory so that your game will flow smoother which will make playing it a lot more enjoyable </s>
<s> hi my 2 cents worth is to get a pc w a good gamer card </s>
<s> now how do u know the intergrated card is not up to snuff </s>
<s> well check out the system requirements on most of the newer pc games out there listed on the box and they will recommend the minimun video card for the game </s>
<s> on my old dell i have now getting a super duper one soon i ve had to upgrade the video card twice in 6 years just to keep up with the latest </s>
<s> not sure of the specs on ur possible new pc but if u can upgrade the video card i would most certainly do </s>
<s> otherwise one way or another you will see it in the performance of the games apps u will use </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> 256k graphic integrated is really good for that type of system and it will be okay for a lot of games and most regular uses </s>
<s> i prefer though to buy systems with video cards rather than integrated </s>
<s> most systems with 512mg cards are also reasonably priced </s>
<s> the 512mb and 1 gig cards are just better for performance in games and you will notice the difference when you compete with other players </s>
<s> also the power supply needs can be an issue when upgrading a integrated system and the operating systems can be rather troublesome when upgrade to the card from integrated </s>
<s> i had a really hard time disabling my integrated video when i upgraded to a 256 card and the upgrade eventually killed my power supply </s>
<s> hp likes 350 watt power supplies and most cards like 500 watts or better </s>
<s> so be careful to check the watts on a card purchase </s>
<s> the 220 nvidia cards is your best option with hp because it functions well at 300 watts </s>
<s> these problems are what i discovered while trying to upgrade my old system </s>
<s> which led me to buy my current hp system with a 512 card in the system </s>
<s> i plan to buy the 220 card very soon to boost all my performance stats </s>
<s> i recommend that u buy a system with a 512mg card and save yourself all the upgrading stuff </s>
<s> also do not frown on a reconditioned system because u can get one with all those features you want for much less money </s>
<s> i did </s>
<s> hi jose you ll get a lot of good answers here most will be technical </s>
<s> here s a philosophical answer </s>
<s> can you afford the house of your dreams </s>
<s> the car of your dreams </s>
<s> what other purchase could you make where the item of your highest desire is as affordable as the computer you really want </s>
<s> for the additional cost of a few hundred dollars you ll get the graphics card expansion slot or whatever is desired </s>
<s> it s time to think outside of your dollar limitations because these are self imposed </s>
<s> will you regret the limitation of the integrated video card </s>
<s> probably not but will you regret the thought process that told you it was unobtainable </s>
<s> yes you will </s>
<s> go for it get it and keep going </s>
<s> i ve just installed w7 on one of my old pcs so this should give you a good comparison between the option of buying a new pc or upgrading an old one my pc had a cpu of 2 6mhz so i just needed to upgrade the ram to 1 24gb cost 21 the w7 installation disk was 168 after the install i had to spend 60 on a gforce graphics card 256mb to get the benefits of the aero 3d and directx applications this system works perfect but as you can see it wasn t cheap 249 obviously i don t know the cost of the pc you are thinking to buy but the intergrated 256mb graphics is good enough for your gaming requirements </s>
<s> i have an hp system and highly recommend them but i would never buy a system with an integrated card because they suck even though you dont play games regularly it would be best if you can get a computer that at least has the option of upgrading the seperate card </s>
<s> but this is what i would do friend only you can know what is best suited to the things you are going to use it for </s>
<s> the answer to this question depends on the motherboard in the computer you are looking at </s>
<s> some motherboards have pcie slots to add aftermarket video cards but on some computers that use cheaper mbs this is not an option </s>
<s> yes you will regret the integrated graphics later </s>
<s> it means that the video memory is shared with the computer s motherboard memory </s>
<s> buy a computer that has a separate slot for a video card </s>
<s> then buy a video card with as much ram as you want on it </s>
<s> jose intergrated graphics means that the quot graphics card quot in the system is not really a graphics card at all </s>
<s> the graphics on the system you are considering uses part of the system memory to generate the graphics </s>
<s> 256mb may sound like a large amount but it is miniscule when it comes to the new games or other graphics intensive applications like photo editing streaming video etc </s>
<s> you cannot add additional memory to integrated graphics you can add system memory but the graphics portion used by your machine will still be 256mb </s>
<s> if you want to play the new games edit photos or look at video on your computer i would recommend a discrete graphics card i e </s>
<s> a stand alone add in graphics card such as those manufactured by nvidia or amd ati </s>
<s> for the new games you need a minimum of 512mb of graphics memory on your discrete graphics card </s>
<s> however most of the new cards have at least 720mb up to 1tb of memory </s>
<s> the more dedicated memory you have on your discrete card the more graphics intensive applications you will be able to run at higher resolutions and faster frame rates </s>
<s> i peruse the packages available at costco regularly and they have some systems there that do have discrete graphics already installed </s>
<s> i saw a gateway system at costco today that had a stand alone ati radeon hd4500 series graphics card and an acer system that had a nvidia geforce gt220 </s>
<s> both systems were selling for under 800 00 including cpu monitor and peripherals keyboard muose etc </s>
<s> you didn t say what your budget was but you could add a discrete graphics card to the system you are considering </s>
<s> there are some older model graphics cards that are still carried new by some retailers or you may be able to pick up a used card on e bay or other on line auction site for a fair price </s>
<s> i suggest you research graphics cards on the internet before you make your final decision </s>
<s> there is some good information on wikipedia at nvidia and ati </s>
<s> i found both amd ati and nvidia chips comparison tables at hope this helps you and you can get what you want for a reasonable dollar </s>
<s> rick in calgary canada </s>
<s> graphics handling is one of the most resource consuming tasks for any computer </s>
<s> that s why some companies put a lot of money into specialised graphics cards money that the buyer has to reimburse </s>
<s> previous generations of cpus could not handle demanding graphics as a task among others </s>
<s> as monitor sizes grew and game designers took advantage of the technically possible the graphics part needed a gpu graphics processing unit and very fast memory </s>
<s> that expensive stuff is not found on a motherboard </s>
<s> what can be integrated on a mother board is a level below the highly sophisticated stuff </s>
<s> i work a lot with photos and videos and i do not need the high speed of modern games </s>
<s> so for me the integrated solution is fine </s>
<s> the fact that 256 mb are taken away from 2 or 4 gb main memory does not make much of a difference </s>
<s> modern computers have high speed buses and approach in their throughput the performance of some good not top dedicated graphics cards </s>
<s> so the performance may be suitable for most people s needs </s>
<s> if the future computer has 2 or better 4 gb of memory if the front side bus has a speed of 800 mhz or better if there is a fast 2 or 3 or 4 processor cpu provided and the graphics adapter can handle 1600x1200 pixels then the machine should be decent </s>
<s> oh by the way if future games need even more power you can still buy a dedicated graphics card if the computer has an available pci express x16 slot </s>
<s> the x16 stands for 16 times the normal pci speed and is usually available in one slot only </s>
<s> with two graphics adapters a computer can run two screens what i do and enjoy a lot </s>
<s> then again you cannot be to pretty or to rich or have to much computing power </s>
<s> i would be cautious about buying systems with integrated grpahics </s>
<s> i recently bought an hp p6310f and was unable to get the system bios to correctly recognize an ati radeon 5670 pci express video card that i installed </s>
<s> i eventually gave up on installing the card and reverted to the system integrated grahics which look fine but have no hdmi output for my tv </s>
<s> my advice would be to buy a system that has a low end pci express graphics card installed that you can upgrade when you have the money </s>
<s> there seem to be plenty of reasonable machines with radeon 4350 cards in them </s>
<s> hi it is almost impossible to find a pc laptop or desktop that does not come with a built in integrated graphics card </s>
<s> most are pretty good however i would try to stay clear of integrated cards that use shared memory </s>
<s> i have seen this system by many names including hyper memory </s>
<s> simply put the builders of the laptop desktop have taken a cheap route and built there system to share the computers ram </s>
<s> the integrated card has no ram of its own and must share the resources of the computers ram </s>
<s> this is ok but can cause your computer to slow down drastically when its working complex tasks </s>
<s> the better systems have there own ram attached to the integrated graphics card </s>
<s> if you are just after a system for word processing etc then shared memory systems are fine </s>
<s> for everything else get a machine with a dedicated graphics card with onboard memory </s>
<s> first you should know what an integrated graphics card is </s>
<s> it s simply a graphics quot card quot or chip s really that are permanently part of the motherboard </s>
<s> so it s a bunch of chips that are part of your pc s motherboard including video memory and video display chips </s>
<s> the bios by default will tell the computer to use the built in internal graphics microchips quot card quot without these chips you d have no display </s>
<s> the problem with the integrated graphics card is that you cannot add hardware and thus features like more ram to it </s>
<s> to escape from this tyranny of having no choice in your card s features you can buy a true quot graphics card quot i e a card that fits into the card slots a daughter board in the computer </s>
<s> you will then be able to buy the improved features you desire </s>
<s> this card becomes part of the pc system by the software that comes with the card which tells the pc to use it how to use it etc and not to use the integrated card and you ll probably have to change the setup bios it depends on your bios </s>
<s> there are much more powerful graphic cards than the integrated chip ones which are usually just adequate in a standard pc </s>
<s> you can get a card with four times the memory or even more than the integrated card three times the clock speed speed and so on </s>
<s> but it will cost you 100 200 or more dollars to buy an quot external quot daughter board based graphics card with stunning features great for games graphics </s>
<s> and be sure its returnable in case it s not compatible with your pc which can happen </s>
<s> 256mb is not so hefty as far as graphic card video card memory goes btw </s>
<s> so if you re a gamer buy a card install it and game away fast and furiously </s>
<s> it depends </s>
<s> the base graphics cards are getting better but you will definitely not be able to play the higher end games with an integrated graphics card </s>
<s> if you cannot afford one now and if the system will allow you to add in a better pci e graphics card later then that is an option </s>
<s> you can save up and buy something like an nvidia gts 250 </s>
<s> its not the best one out there but has plenty of horsepower to play most anything at a decent frame rate </s>
<s> something like this would be nice </s>
<s> your integrated graphics is terrible for gaming but you can buy a new graphics card </s>
<s> integrated graphics is good for windows and even for some games that are not very demanding but never good for the latest games </s>
<s> i say you should just stick with your current configuration because good gaming graphics cards are very expensive </s>
<s> you would be wasting your money if you bought a new graphics card unless you are really into pc gaming </s>
<s> if you want to try pc gaming but don t want to sink too much money into the hardware then an xbox 360 is the perfect alternative </s>
<s> you most likely won t be able to play newer games on the integrated graphics computer at least not the way they are meant to be presented </s>
<s> that being said you should research specifically what motherboard model is installed into the computer you intend on buying to see what sort of upgrade slots are available and open to add a dedicated graphics card to later </s>
<s> specifically you should look for a pci express x16 slot although the newer 2 0 standard of this type of card slot will leave available more upgrade options because it is backwards compatible </s>
<s> after confirming this research what kind of video card is compatible with your motherboard </s>
<s> some motherboards will only support either nvidia or ati video cards not both </s>
<s> while other motherboards will be just fine with whatever you put into them </s>
<s> you should then pick a video card that is 1 compatible with the mother board 2 uses the aforementioned pci express x16 or 2 0 variant should the motherboard support it 3 has or exceeds the recommended specifications of the most taxing game that you intend to play and 4 is a recommended model card with good reviews purchased from your favorite online retailer </s>
<s> purchasing online may be a hassle with the mail but the prices are generally cheaper often times with free shipping and no taxes and with certain retailers you will have better customer service with knowledgeable technicians to assist you </s>
<s> after confirming all of this information if the price of all of this turns out to be more than you expected i would suggest you look for a pre built computer with a dedicated graphics card to begin with if playing games of any sort is your priority </s>
<s> you ll ultimately save money by getting what you want up front rather than purchasing something that will need upgrading soon </s>
<s> besides buying parts like graphics cards that are last years news can save a ton of money because you can still do most everything that is required at almost 50 of the original price is some instances </s>
<s> happy hunting </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> no reason to regret the purchase later for having integrated graphics </s>
<s> with integrated graphics the computer builder seller is able to give you a very affordable machine </s>
<s> when they build a machine such as the one you re buying they have no way knowing exactly what it will be used for </s>
<s> buying building them this way allows them to get the computer out the door cheaper to you </s>
<s> after you buy this machine you can then upgrade the graphics card as time and money allow </s>
<s> you may be able to play the games you want just fine with the integrated graphics and you may be able to adjust the integrated graphics solution to suit you </s>
<s> if you re a gamer or getting into gaming you probably already know that many games require more memory processing intense graphics cards </s>
<s> choosing a proper upgrade can be helped by taking the time to research a potential card before purchasing </s>
<s> with time on your side you can make a good decision on that upgrade if and when it becomes necessary </s>
<s> not long ago 256mb of memory in a graphics card was pretty hefty </s>
<s> what you ll find once you begin your search is that graphics cards and games are way ahead of the curve in the processor memory department compared to your basic desktop </s>
<s> in other words the games are processor intense and the graphics cards have to be intense to play those games </s>
<s> i d say the standard now is more like 1gb of ddr5 memory </s>
<s> amazingly with all their improvements a decent graphics card is still pretty affordable </s>
<s> so unless you are playing older games or mildly intense games then plan on doing an upgrade </s>
<s> and really take your time to research which graphics card to upgrade to </s>
<s> good luck </s>

<s> for playing complex game often you need individual graphic card e g </s>
<s> nvidia g force 9600 however to buy the hp won t hurt your future graphic card expansion providing a spare express slot built on the main board once you insert a individual graphic card connect display screen s cable to it and install software you should be ready to play large games </s>
<s> regards ching </s>
<s> not the simplest question because it calls for more than one factor </s>
<s> first you need to find out 1 just how much ram your motherboard can handle and then 2 how big a video card it will carry </s>
<s> i doubt that the pc you re describing will handle the high end games </s>
<s> but if you can establish that it does have the capability then you can always find ram at a good price to increase your system s capacity and the video card on up to 1 gig at a later time </s>
<s> the most important thing is to find out just how quot good quot your pc is before you start pumping money into it </s>
<s> in order to play full 1080p hg video smoothly you need more video graphics memory </s>
<s> some new computers accomplish this by having the modest integrated graphics chip get extra needed memory by sharing the computer s system ram memory </s>
<s> the minimum for decent hd playback is 512mb of video graphics memory but i recommend having more if possible </s>
<s> we were in the same situation as you recently with my girlfriend s computer </s>
<s> we solved it by adding a plug in graphics </s>
<s> i found an msi brand radeon hd4550 card with 1gb of its own video graphics memory </s>
<s> you can probably manage just fine with the next lower model called hd4350 with 512mb video memory or an nvidia gt210 model </s>
<s> these cards are come with hdmi output jack and they re available online for 19 99 to 39 99 after a mail in rebate and remember no tax and sometimes free shipping </s>
<s> check tigerdirect com and newegg com for availability </s>
<s> don t buy anything off the shelf pc s notes or net find sum 1 u trust and get built a machine you need to the job the cost is so stupid that u will wonder why u are so dum </s>
<s> firstly i certainly would never buy a pc with an intergrated graphics card and shared memory </s>
<s> the only exception to this is in a laptop as in laptops you have very little choice </s>
<s> an intergrated graphics card is built into the motherboard </s>
<s> most pc s can also be upgraded later on to add an extra graphics card to the machine but if you do decide to go for one with an intergrated gpu make sure the motherboard has slots like pci express to allow additional graphics cards to be added later </s>
<s> if it has an agp slot to add an additional card later again avoid it like the plague cos agp is old and isn t made anymore </s>
<s> as for the memory 256mb of memory is quite hefty but as it is shared memory be careful of this as this is a big con </s>
<s> what this means is that instead of the gpu having it s own dedicated memory for graphics functions it will share the memory with the pc s own internal ram </s>
<s> so you will lose that ram </s>
<s> for example if the specification says it has 4gb ram your machine will only actually have 3 75gb of ram as 256mb 1 4gb is taken up as video memory </s>
<s> the major problem with shared memory is that the memory the pc is using isn t designed for graphics use and therefore takes longer for the gpu to use the data properly than dedicated gpu memory </s>
<s> as for upgrading the memory later you could add more memory to the pc but this wouldn t give you more memory on the gpu just more memory in the pc </s>
<s> another thing to be careful of is try and find out what integrated gpu is in the pc </s>
<s> if it s an intel graphics card don t even bother </s>
<s> these things are ok for basic office programs but most games are appalling </s>
<s> if it has an ati radeon or nvidia card inside these are the two major ones and these are the best ones for graphics intense games </s>
<s> i m mainly an ati fan myself as i ve had a few issues with nvidia </s>
<s> also if it says nvidia on the description make sure that it s referring to the gpu as nvidia also make motherboard controllers </s>
<s> you can buy some systems that don t have integrated graphics cards but sometimes they can be a little bit more expensive to add a graphics card yourself afterwards shouldn t cost too much as long as it has pci express slots on the motherboard </s>
<s> the system that it seems that hp are selling probably would cost you about 290 to build yourself or about 320 if you wanted a non integrated gpu </s>
<s> if this is cheaper than costco you might be better building it yourself pc s aren t that hard to build all bits have some kind of pin system to prevent you inserting things the wrong way or doing things wrong normally if it doesn t slot in easily then it s not meant to go that way or if there is some plastic clip in the way then it s wrong even the cpu has a corner of pins cut out to prevent you inserting that upside down </s>
<s> a reasonable ati radeon hd4350 with 512mb dedicated gpu only costs 29 81 from scan computers in bolton product number ln25298 </s>
<s> i d highly recommend going for the gigabyte one as gigabyte cards are pretty decent and last a reasonable time </s>
<s> the build yourself price above was based on the following scan parts which would give you a reasonable pc with fully licensed windows 7 ln26201 ln27699 ln28226 ln29161 ln31478 ln31747 ln34013 </s>
<s> many motherboards offer an integrated graphics card but the better boards also have a slot for you to install your own hand selected video graphics card </s>
<s> you will need to double check the hp offering to see if it has the ability to add a card into the system should you be disappointed with using just the integrated adapter </s>
<s> personally i am not that keen on integrated vga ports as they have to share on board ram and the chipset is often not as good as say a dedicated nvidia or ati card </s>
<s> that aside the integrated vga port will work if all you need to do is use office programs surf the net and access email </s>
<s> i have not seen a big enough performance gain by adding in a cheap low end card so you may need to consider adding in a decent graphics card my preference is nvidia 9600 or better but if you are looking at high quality games you may need to go better again </s>
<s> that will cost some serious dollars so that is something you will need to weigh up </s>
<s> if it was my pc i would definitely be looking to add in a separate video graphics card the harder quaestion to answer there is which card which chipset how much ram do i need on that card 1 gb usually is enough and what resolution can i drive that card up to </s>
<s> monitors can now display up to hd definition so thats another consideration </s>
<s> hope that helps you </s>

<s> hello if you are talking about a desktop then yes you can buy it with the integrated graphics card and then add a dedicated graphics card to it later </s>
<s> if you are talking about a laptop then no you cannot and you will be stuck with what you have for graphics </s>
<s> also it is a hard call as to what you should do </s>
<s> i have laptops with both one with integrated graphics and one with dedicated graphics </s>
<s> personally it doesn t really matter to me because i m not a gamer either </s>
<s> but i have tried playing some latest games on my laptop with the integrated graphics and they played fine for me </s>
<s> but a true gamer might notice the difference </s>
<s> my advice to you is since you are on a budget go ahead and get the one with the integrated graphics </s>
<s> computers and their components are changing all the time </s>
<s> you would be just fine with this type of graphics </s>
<s> but a serious gamer will tell you differently and they will be right too </s>
<s> we are both right with what we tell you </s>
<s> but whatever you do decide and if you are buying a laptop make sure that it uses intel processors </s>
<s> amd processors in laptops especially hp s have a long and sorbid history of running way hot and damaging the other components and eventually burning up the computer </s>
<s> i will never own a computer of any kind with amd processors </s>
<s> i almost made the mistake and bought an hp tablet that had amd processors </s>
<s> i notice it got incredibly hot and so i ran a tester and checked its cpu and gpu temp and the procesors were running at 80 to 110 degrees celcius </s>
<s> i immediately took the laptop back and i just went online and bought one with intel processor </s>
<s> i have never been anymore happier </s>
<s> but back to your question i think you would be fine with a laptop with integrated graphics </s>
<s> but it hasd to be your decision so make sure you make the right one for you because with a laptop you are stuck with whatever graphics card you get </s>
<s> i would strongly reccommend that if you plan to game on this machine you are considering that you pick up an aftermarket graphics card preferably online since box store retailers tend to overcharge for pc components </s>
<s> also 256mb may have been be a while ago but now it s puny </s>
<s> also the fact that it s shared means it will take away that amount of memory out of your system memory the 4gb or however much your compy comes with so it hurts both the video and the processor perfomance </s>
<s> considering getting one of the 50 75 nvidia cards like the geforce 8600 or something </s>
<s> it ll be well worth the extra cost </s>
<s> happy computing </s>
<s> iamthedonut </s>
<s> shared video memory using part of main memory ram for the display circuit s frame buffers which temporarily hold the rendered content being sent to the screen </s>
<s> shared memory is used in pcs that have the display circuit built into the motherboard rather than housed on a separate more costly display adapter card </s>
<s> sharing main memory with the display function reduces the amount of memory available to applications and main memory is not as fast as the specialized video memory on stand alone cards </s>
<s> on lower end systems the video is integrated into the motherboard </s>
<s> the video controller uses a certain amount of shared ram for video memory </s>
<s> the shared ram is taken away from main system ram </s>
<s> thus on a 512 mb system if the integrated controller uses 128 mb shared video ram the main system only uses 384 mb of ram and this is the number you ll see when checking for the memory </s>
<s> when you go out to purchase a computer some models specify that they have a certain amount of megabytes of memory and they may have a video card that supports a certain amount of shared memory </s>
<s> this means that when the video card is in use especially in higher display modes it will take some of the memory normally dedicated to other computing activities and use it as its own </s>
<s> thus if you buy a computer with 512 mb of memory and 128 mb of shared memory and you frequently use a high display settings you may actually only have 384 mb </s>
<s> all this is down to you will you be using as a pc or for games </s>
<s> motherboards with onboard video are great for the average user </s>
<s> but for a gamer not so much </s>
<s> the motherboard still has to do 60 of the work </s>
<s> and in your case if you had 2gb of ram one eighth of that 250mb is reserved for video use </s>
<s> it s not quite that simple because that shared memory is dynamically assigned but something has to keep track and move stuff around when needed </s>
<s> so you are putting an additional load on the system as a whole when you have integrated anything lan audio video </s>
<s> that load equates to less resources to display video </s>
<s> but the motherboard mfg ers trend is unmistakable less pci expansion slots and more onboard goodies </s>
<s> back to video </s>
<s> putting in a pci e video card will free up the shared memory overall lowering the system load and giving you better faster refresh video than ever before </s>
<s> you can select how much video memory you want when you buy the card </s>
<s> and another thing does your new computer have a nice big monitor </s>
<s> i have never seen an onboard video system do justice to a good monitor </s>
<s> so here s the short short recap </s>
<s> if you will only be a casual user then the onboard video will be just fine for you but if somewhere deep inside there is a gamer looking to get a taste fyi even google earth will look sooo much different </s>
<s> there are two problems with purchasing the pc you are referring to </s>
<s> first the 256 megs of ram will in time prove to be inadequate </s>
<s> that i can promise </s>
<s> even if you only watch movies on hulu you will need more </s>
<s> the second problem is that when graphics cards are built into the motherboard many manufacturers do not include a graphics card slot on the board </s>
<s> new motherboards have limited slots to start with and unless there is a graphics slot also installed on the board should the graphics card go bad at a later date you will have a real problem finding a replacement that give any performance in the slots available </s>
<s> additionally should you add any internal cards you will find you have to give up something perhaps something important to you to free up a slot at all </s>
<s> look for a pc that has a separate graphics card and if you budget will allow it look for one with at least 512 megs of video memory </s>
<s> when the system runs out of dedicated video memory and starts sharing your ram memory everything slows down </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> what a wonderful analogy by wkw427 as a teacher i will use that when explaining to staff the merits of separate graphics cards </s>
<s> you re absolutely right by the way </s>
<s> jose for most people those types of systems are indeed the way to go </s>
<s> embedding the graphics chip on the motherboard is a good way for the manufacturer s to keep the cost down and make them more affordable for everyone </s>
<s> the obviouos drawback is you may be limited later </s>
<s> you ll really have to check the system and see what it can accomodate </s>
<s> you re going to want to see if it has an available pcie slot and the type you re after for video is an x16 </s>
<s> you ll also want to see if there s a power connector already there to power that video card you may later purchase </s>
<s> consider the games you may want to play too </s>
<s> many of the newer on line mmorpg s will require 256 dedicated ram at the very minimum and at that level they ll be almost unplayable </s>
<s> for performance you re looking at 896mb dedicated ram on the video card </s>
<s> i ve got a special nvidia with 1 7g and it s a great card </s>
<s> my previous was a p4 dual core at 3g with 256mb video and i upgraded the whole computer because it didn t have enough horsepower </s>
<s> my suggestion which is the same as i give almost every time list the things you need or want to do with the computer </s>
<s> check the requirements for each of those tasks and get the system that will perform them </s>
<s> spend the most you can afford now and get the best system you can otherwise you ll be back very quickly trying to figure out how to upgrade it </s>
<s> sometimes it requires saving for a few months and putting a couple hundred aside to dedicate to that system </s>
<s> budgets are tight for almost everyone these days and we re all watching our money closer than we did </s>
<s> best of luck </s>
<s> scott </s>
<s> jose integrated graphics kinda suck big wind </s>
<s> the main problem is the integration </s>
<s> that is it s built into the motherboard </s>
<s> if it s an intel graphics adapter you re likelyhood for regret is much higher than if the motherboard had an ati or nvidia chipset on board </s>
<s> intel s graphics adapters are basically crap </s>
<s> they can t handle the heavy lifting that ati and nvidia chips can </s>
<s> there s also the matter of shared memory </s>
<s> if you have say 1 gb of ram that 256 mb is 25 of the total amount of memory available </s>
<s> i would imagine the system you re looking at probably has more but you get the idea </s>
<s> that memory could be better used for running programs and games </s>
<s> as far as shared ram goes depending on the system s bios you may be able to configure the video to use more or less ram </s>
<s> of course the downside to that is that it s going to take ram away from the main system pool </s>
<s> and that generally isn t always the best thing to do </s>
<s> many games these days do require a fairly powerful graphics adapter </s>
<s> that is if you want to play at frame rates higher than a snail s pace </s>
<s> check the system requirements on the games you want to play and go from there </s>
<s> the main reason you will want to do this some motherboards come with fairly outdated graphics </s>
<s> chipsets that are a year or so out of date </s>
<s> if that s the case you will probably be much better off with buying a video card and plugging it in </s>
<s> on the plus side all may not be entirely lost </s>
<s> check the specs of the system to make sure it has a pcie 2 0 8x or 16x slot </s>
<s> many motherboards have one so you can plug in a more powerful video card later </s>
<s> the slot will look like a regular pci slot however it s usually set further in and may have a locking device toward the rear to keep the card seated </s>
<s> it ll also be closest to the cpu </s>
<s> there s one other thing to check </s>
<s> if they ve got the machine on display and it s got vista or windows 7 preloaded on it you can go to the system properties and check the system s windows experience index score </s>
<s> be sure to look at the score for graphics and gaming graphics </s>
<s> if these two scores are below say 2 0 you might want to run as fast as possible away from the deal </s>
<s> you re going to want at least a 4 0 if not higher if you plan on doing any serious gaming </s>
<s> sometimes the installed card is enough but sometimes you need more what you need to know does the new computer have any empty expansion slots </s>
<s> if so then you can add a new graphics card later when your money lets you but shop around before buying </s>
<s> i ve found if you look around you can get some really good deals geeks tiger direct are just a few places you can look for good and sometimes cheap cards </s>
<s> i would look into buying a computer that allows an additional video card </s>
<s> a intergrated fixed type could be limiting with some of the games you may be looking at playing </s>
<s> many systems sold today include integrated video with allows the systems to be immediately useable for basic users </s>
<s> todays integrated video can handle most basic tasks like internet explorer word excel etc </s>
<s> however virtually all systems that offer the integrated video also provide at least 1 pci e slot to accomodate the addition of a more powerful graphics card </s>
<s> due to the universality of the graphics cards sold today most if not all will work in any standard pci e slot </s>
<s> because of that most systems can be easily upgraded to an external graphics card with a simple settings change to the bios </s>
<s> some systems are sophisticated enough to automatically sense the installation of an external graphics card and will automatically disable the integrated video for you </s>
<s> thue the bottom line is that you shouldn t worry about the graphics upgradabiliy of the system that you are considering </s>
<s> rather concentrate on the storage capacity processing capability and manufacture support as these are more likely to be issues for you going forward </s>
<s> i bought a new computer last year and it came with integrated graphics </s>
<s> the newer games are not playable with integrated graphics </s>
<s> though you will be suprised what games it will play with graphics settings set to low </s>
<s> like crysis grid and batman arkham asylum </s>
<s> i know people knock the integratged graphics down </s>
<s> they do have less graphics power </s>
<s> but on a budget they can get you by </s>
<s> i probaly will be sticking with mine for another year </s>
<s> i also had a computer before with a amd 4000 and 7800 gtx nvidia graphics card </s>
<s> this system runs almost all those game just with lower settings </s>
<s> their are also games that a company is going to make for just integrated graphics cards </s>
<s> the recent game torchlight is a good example of this </s>
<s> integrated are more flexible if your desktop or notebook has additional pcie slot or if u feel the integrated card not power enough can choose too much graphic cards i mean integrated if not mistaken is cpu ram motherboard using this to create integrated card since most cpu have integrated graphic cards too much options to choose what graphic cards you want if u don t like the integrated graphic card performance just buy graphic card or cards install driver some will enable integrate graphic card with graphic card or cards some will disable integrated graphic card </s>
<s> yes 256mb video memory is pretty hefty enough to run even some of the most graphically intense games on the market </s>
<s> the term quot integrated quot refers to the fact that the gpu graphics processor unit is part of the system board and not a plugin card </s>
<s> it derives its memory from the ram that is for the regular memory on the system board </s>
<s> depending upon how much the main memory is 2gb 3gb even 4gb depending on the system processor and peripheral chips have limitations the video memory is subtracted from that value </s>
<s> in a worst case event you could diable the onboard video and install a video card with more memory to support a newer game that requires more than the 256mb supported by the integrated system seyup </s>
<s> hi jose integrated graphics have come a long way in recent years and for general pc work they are just fine </s>
<s> for the modern generation of games with very realistic graphics they won t do the job requiring you either to reduce the resolution or slow the frame rate neither of which is acceptable really </s>
<s> all is not lost though providing the motherboard has at least one and maybe two pcie x16 slots available you can upgrade your graphics with a dedicated card when your budget allows </s>
<s> you didn t say which system you have in mind so check whether the expansion slots i mentioned are available </s>
<s> you might also want to bear in mind that many of the current crop of more advanced ganes have been written to take advantage of multicore processor chips now available intel have some very impressive demonstrations comparing rendering speeds of his res graphics with 1 2 and 4 processors </s>
<s> how many cores does your proposed system have </s>
<s> what this amounts to is that modern gaming is a rather specialized use of a pc and a general purpose pc will be unlikely to deliver that specialized performance </s>
<s> if you are or want to be a heavy gamer you might be better off going for a machine built for the purpose or build your own </s>
<s> the downside is that they don t come cheap </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> integrated graphics means the graphics card is on the mother board and shares your ram memory instead of having it s own memory deciated to the video card </s>
<s> now days computers come with a couple of free slots pci pcie where you can disable the on board video card and puchase a video card if you ever did need the extra power </s>
<s> i would reccomend researching the pc and check to see if it comes with any addtional slots for upgrade purposes </s>
<s> if your not going to be gaming and using the pc for internt word processing and light video editing you should be fine </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> ok integrated means that the hardware exists on the motherboard </s>
<s> it s not a seperate one like geforce </s>
<s> for laptops it may say intel gma something </s>
<s> integrated cards are not i repeat not for games </s>
<s> especially if you are bying a laptop </s>
<s> i have a geforce 8600 gs for my laptop and it can not handle all games </s>
<s> anyway you need a graphics card lets say geforce 9 with at least 512 memory and ram 2 or 3 at gb especially with windows 7 depends on the games you want to play ps are you buying online </s>

<s> motherboards that come with built in graphic are not very good for the high end games what i would suggest it to fit a graphics card to your new computer that will do two thing 1st all the ram power will go to your computer and sppeed it up and the new graphics card will have its own memory get the biggest one you can afford and that should handle most top end games </s>
<s> ps i like nvidia cards they dont usually cause any probs </s>

<s> when you said a new pc i presume that you are referencing a desktop machine in which case generally speaking i wouldn t worry as you can generally easily add a graphics card later </s>
<s> a few caveats to consider nevertheless </s>
<s> first is that generally speaking most oems will put a low end power supply 300w max typically that won t be able to handle many higher end graphics cards </s>
<s> in addition if some of the very high end cards may be too long to even fit in the case </s>
<s> that was certainly the case with some of the 11 inch cards i ve seen people try to put in the standard hp desktop case </s>
<s> that being said for a casual gamer any card that size probably would be overkill </s>
<s> the final major caveat i would consider is whether this machine is a slimline case </s>
<s> you can get a video card for a slimline machine but they tend to be lower end cards so if you are really interested in getting something very high end later on you may want to avoid slim line machines </s>
<s> for someone buying a new desktop i would suggest trying the integrated graphics first before spending the money on a dedicated card </s>
<s> since you don t sound like you play a lot of games you will probably find that for most tasks you will hardly notice </s>
<s> integrated graphics aren t as bad as they used to be </s>
<s> the newer integrated solutions have enough processing power to playback blu ray content so you may find that integrated graphics go farther than you think </s>
<s> that being said on a larger resolution monitor integrated graphics may be wholly inadequate so ymmv </s>
<s> as for laptops generally speaking you are pretty well limited generally to the graphics chipset the machine comes with </s>
<s> for a while i saw a number of machines with mxm based graphics chipsets but it seems to no longer be supported anymore so i would be surprised if you found any laptops where the dedicated graphics wasn t soldered to the logic board </s>
<s> therefore for a laptop i would buy the best graphics that you feel comfortable spending </s>
<s> when buying a new pc it s always good to have another source to compare what you are looking at and compare it to what is being offered elsewhere </s>
<s> to that end let me recomend tigerdirect com </s>
<s> they have a wide variety of manufacturers and also have refurb units for sale </s>
<s> their refurb units come with a warrenty and i have never gotten a bad deal with them even on refurb units </s>
<s> often you can buy a refurb with more computing power or graphics capabilities then buying a brand new unit </s>
<s> if you really have a restrictive budget a refurb might be the way to go </s>
<s> the fact is if your are not able to update a computer s hardware you might be better off with a refurb unit what with the industry turning over technology at the rate they do </s>
<s> anything you buy today may be obsolete 6 monts to 2 years down the road and it s a little bit easier to replace a computer if you didn t pay an arm and a leg to buy the current unit you have </s>
<s> lee let me first be brutally honest the pc that you have in mind will play bluray videos do word processing and surf the internet with ease but forget about gaming </s>
<s> i build many mediacenter pc s and for the most part they all have integrated graphics </s>
<s> i prefer the ati 785g chipset with hd4200 graphics </s>
<s> but the mediacenter pc s that i build are for media such as watching hdtv and viewing movies </s>
<s> on occasion i build a unit for a client who is like yourself aware that he may like to make future enhancements such as upgrading hardware in order to play games </s>
<s> to answer another question 256mb s of video memory is not enough for gaming even with the help of quot side port quot memory that some motherboards provide </s>
<s> today s newer games really require at least 1gb of memory </s>
<s> so you can add a dedicated video card at a later date assuming it will fit in the case you are buying </s>
<s> you would be looking at cards that are between 8 quot and 12 quot long and may not fit in your case </s>
<s> then before upgrading anything you would need to see if your power supply could handle the extra wattage </s>
<s> with the pc you are considering i seriously doubt it </s>
<s> what you are looking to buy is a quot bargain basement quot unit that hp builds for costco and the pricing has to be low or costco won t even consider selling it </s>
<s> hp needs to make a profit so the parts they use in these systems are not exactly quot premium quot parts </s>
<s> as i said you will be able to view videos and do quot normal quot computing tasks but gaming is out of the question </s>
<s> you can add more quot system quot memory but not more memory for the graphics card </s>
<s> it s built into the card </s>
<s> lee i don t want to quot put down quot the system you are looking at as it will be just fine for normal computing but i would suggest you wait and save some more money to get a better system </s>
<s> either that or build your own </s>

<s> assuming it s a standard atx or matx you can add a very capable card and play any game you want at high resolution limited only by your budget and power supply </s>
<s> high end video cards have separate pci e power connectors and can require more power than your cpu </s>

<s> advice for jose be cautious about the power supply and motherboard of the computer that you buy if you plan to upgrade the graphics card </s>
<s> the integrated graphics in some systems can t be upgraded due to motherboard or power supply limitations </s>
<s> a computer that has a 450w to 500w power supply and an already installed graphics card is the best bet if you plan to upgrade the graphics card later </s>
<s> games require a lot of memory and cpu cycles </s>
<s> a 500mb graphics card would serve the needs and abilities of a casual game player </s>
<s> a video card will also reduce voice picture sync problems dropped frames etc </s>
<s> when you are streaming editing or capturing video </s>
<s> if you need to save money now buy a stripped down model of a higher end computer good processor and motherboard with extra pci pci express and memory slots </s>
<s> you can add a video card and more memory later on </s>
<s> it isn t hard to do and not very expensive </s>
<s> you may discover you don t need better graphics capability often enough to justify buying a video card but not likely </s>
<s> all sorts of applications and webpages will require more and more graphics capability in the future </s>
<s> an integrated graphics card probably won t give you a great experience with the more graphics intense games </s>
<s> but it might not bee too bad </s>
<s> you can upgrade most computers graphics with a card and there are a lot of good cards available for less than 100 00 </s>
<s> check to see that it has a pcie slot available in case you want to upgrade later </s>
<s> that two hands can type with ease certainly doesn t apply to me a one finger dolt be i and yet can type and draw at same time must mean i don t need a graphics card at all but is integrated in my tiny brain </s>
<s> hi jose a little while back i picked up a motherboard that came with integrated video </s>
<s> i did this as i was only upgrading a few things didn t want to buy a seperate video card at the time that is in addition to the other pieces i was buying </s>
<s> if the unit you are looking at allows you to add another card to go along with it later pcie than save the money get it </s>
<s> i ll explain briefly </s>
<s> i can later add another video card along with the one i already have making it two video cards which increases the video ram </s>
<s> using the pcie connector on the motherboard </s>
<s> the one you are looking at will use some of the ram the system comes with </s>
<s> in this case 256 megs </s>
<s> seeing i put in 4 gigs of ram i didn t lose much </s>
<s> is 256 megs of video huge </s>
<s> not really </s>
<s> most cards are double that the current ones are four times that 1 gig </s>
<s> but you can play many games with out loss or much loss </s>
<s> the best way to find out is to see what is suggested on the video card size of the games you are interested in </s>
<s> it will list two levels </s>
<s> minimum recommened </s>
<s> minimum is what will get you by recommended or better will play the game smoothly </s>
<s> also keep in mind that you may have to buy any additional hardware like a video card upgrades from hp or one of their merchants in order to work </s>
<s> these are proprietary computers </s>
<s> the deal is that they make them at low cost </s>
<s> which is a great way to get a computer </s>
<s> the downfall is that you can t always use any hardware that you see </s>
<s> contact hp of course </s>
<s> don t be discouraged in buying the computer completly as you ll have more fun using it than waiting to find one to buy that you can use </s>
<s> i know you ll hear a few people jump up down about buying component seperate or stand alone cards which is the way to go but that doesn t always fit into the budget </s>
<s> good luck in your purchase remember to save your progress often </s>
<s> the integrated graphics use the processor or cpu of your computer and usually brand systems like hp don t have powerful processors so you will experience troubles n graphic demanding applications like games if gpu or the video is not integrated it relive the cpu from managing all graphic information even from the normal use of whatever is on the screen or monitor so i will recommend to search for any computer with no integrated graphics usually this ones have better mother boards to that handle better the computing processes and the same 256mb of video same cpu and same ram will function a lot better </s>
<s> if you have the budget always opt for the separate video card its always faster but of course more expensive but you wont have regrets </s>
<s> guys selling branded pcs often keep basic information like motherboard model chipset psu details as topsecret even if we ask them they wont tell </s>
<s> as mentioned quot 256mb quot graphic memory but what are its details like model number for example </s>
<s> intel based onboard graphic solutions are not futureproof many games dont run on these even if u take the newer ones like quot dales quot so if u are living onboard go for ati amd or nvida graphic boards like for instance jetway ha07 featuring ati 3300 graphic and of course u can run many recent games on it except the ones called graphic beasts or games like crysis for example yes assemble u r own pc go for amd if u r on a tight budget </s>
<s> hi mr jose these days most modern pc s ship with an integrated graphics card and all current generation machines are upgradeable unless otherwise stated ask the sales representative if the machine is upgradeable </s>
<s> unfortunately integrated graphics is never as good as the add on cards and we currently have a wide range to choose from with sizes from 512mb to 2gb also to remember is that onboard graphics cards uses your systems physical memory meaning if you had 1gb system memory the graphics card would use 256mb leaving you with roughly only 744mb which is not a good idea if you want to run windows 7 smoothly </s>
<s> other factors also play a role if you want to run current generation games meaning that the processor memory and hard drive of your system also plays a role </s>
<s> you can choose between two existing graphic card manufacturers which i myself recommend and use the first is nvidia geforce and the second ati radeon if you were to choose any of these i would recommend the gt 200 series for nvidia and the hd 4000 for ati </s>
<s> if i may ask you to post the full system specifications so that we can verify if the system as a whole will be able to play games that would be great you can just ask the sales representative to compile a list with the specifications </s>
<s> yours sincerely mr w </s>
<s> well once you added in that you might want to play some graphics intensive games the answer is you will have to have a add on video card </s>
<s> there are several reason for this </s>
<s> 1 the integrated cards usually just don t have the necessary processing capability </s>
<s> they may be able to handle hd video playback decently but that s about it </s>
<s> 2 the 256 meg shared memory is not enough and also way too slow </s>
<s> games now days often want 512 megs or more </s>
<s> this depends on resolution and how good a detail you want </s>
<s> also you will probably want to play the games at the resolution that the lcd monitor is made to run at </s>
<s> lcd s unlike crt s really only look good at 1 resolution </s>
<s> it s called their native resolution </s>
<s> you can make them run at lower sizes but the results usually look blurry </s>
<s> 19 quot wants to usually run at 1440x900 a 22 quot wants to run at 1680x1050 </s>
<s> larger 24 quot want 1920x1200 </s>
<s> built in video cards can t do that really at anything other than 10 fps if they are lucky and that won t do for smooth game play </s>
<s> you want 30 60 fps minimum </s>
<s> also the bandwidth of the ram is much higher on a discrete add in video card </s>
<s> for example a 2 lane highway vs a 5 or 7 lane </s>
<s> you can see what can handle more traffic </s>
<s> data to and from the graphics processor </s>
<s> 2 the power supply for machines like that are very minimal </s>
<s> often 300 watts or so </s>
<s> a decent video card will want maybe a 600 watt </s>
<s> higher if you go with more powerful cards </s>
<s> look for sli or crossfire rated power supplies of 750 watt minimum if you go with a really powerful card </s>
<s> this also gets you extra power connectors to connect directly to the video card </s>
<s> some require 2 now by the way this is also true for laptops </s>
<s> lots of them are very cheap now days and sound very fast </s>
<s> don t be fooled by them </s>
<s> they talk about their processor and that is the lesser requirement for games </s>
<s> i would take a core 2 duo processor laptop with a discrete video any day over a core i7 laptop with integrated video </s>
<s> most new games require a high powered graphics card </s>
<s> unless you purchased a high end gaming machine most computer manufacturers that sell a computer with integrated graphics usually include a middlin graphics circuit </s>
<s> to get top graphics performance you will probably need to purchase a high end board </s>
<s> you have several choices from nvidia or ati </s>
<s> these are the two manufacturers that provide the chipsets to third party manufacturers </s>
<s> sites like tigerdirect com and compusa com have high end gaming boards and are good places to start </s>
<s> other options to consider are hd performance and hd television capabilites </s>
<s> these open up a whole world of high end graphics entertainment also and thess option are usually not too much more expensive </s>
<s> my advice is that you would be better off including these options in your research of which boards you will consider </s>
<s> cnet is a very good resource for tapping expert knowledge about these capabilities but you will have to do the hump work to find it </s>
<s> you have several other considerations before you buy </s>
<s> first off most of these high end boards are extremely power hungry </s>
<s> many of them require a power supply with a minimum of 600 watts </s>
<s> eight hundred to a thousand watts is better </s>
<s> this is electricity quot headroom quot and your system will only draw what it needs to the maximum </s>
<s> typically two or three hundred watt power supplies are what most manufacturers include and these are woefully inadequate for any serious gaming </s>
<s> you will definitely have to upgrade your power supply </s>
<s> another consideration is how much onboard ram you want </s>
<s> your computer integrated graphics is dedicating 256 ram from your system ram </s>
<s> 256 mb of ram might seem like a lot but most new graphic boards include 1gb or more of ram on board and you will need it for many new games </s>
<s> allocating more from your main system s ram will really degrade overall performance unless you have the option of adding more system ram </s>
<s> that s something you might want to do anyway to increase overall perforamance and it s a relatively cheap way to do so </s>
<s> you can also save some money by installing the new power supply yourself but make sure you note down where all the power connectors go before you start unplugging the old ones </s>
<s> even experts use simple masking tape to mark connectors so they don t miss one </s>
<s> it helps to number them sequentially before you start start unplugging again so you don t miss one </s>
<s> once you have everything installed you will need to go into your system bios at startup to disable your onboard graphics card </s>
<s> this is a simple step and is usually self explanatory when you find the appropriate submenu </s>
<s> i am also assuming you have a relatively high end monitor and you won t have to purchase one with hd or near hd capability </s>
<s> if not that is another expense and size and quality will go into your decision process </s>
<s> well jose i hope this helps </s>
<s> a whole new world of realism opens up when you upgrade your system to a gaming system </s>
<s> if all of this upgrading seems like more than you want to do then you can simply purchase a high end gaming entertainment system and they come loaded </s>
<s> again cnet is an excellent resource for what is available in high end systems </s>
<s> bueno suerte </s>
<s> t hannibal gay el paso </s>
<s> integrated graphics is not that much as a seperate graphic card it is not even equall to a 64 mb graphic card </s>
<s> if you r buying laptop then graphic card should not be your concern as its working is not gaurnteed but if it is a desktop system then you must chose a computer with windows xp or a computer with no preinstalled windows as it is more expensive </s>
<s> take one with dos and buy xp then buy a seperate graphic card and install new drivers for the card from internet and then download the latest dx directx 11 drivers and enjoy gaming ram 1 5 2 0 gb graphic card nvidia 8800 or ati 3670 256mb seperate the integrated one is additional and not good for exellent gaming some games do run but they lag works till you dont have graphic card processor 2 2 6 c2d </s>
<s> you can get peripheral component interconnect pci video cards for desktop machines if thats what ur using which has its own ram seperate from the motherboard giving you more memory to your machine </s>
<s> if it s a desktop however </s>
<s> im not sure </s>
<s> you may be able to get a pc card for video </s>
<s> so it might be worth getting a pci card for your desktop </s>
<s> first of all all hp computers have integrated graphics that use system ram instead of having their own memory </s>
<s> also if you install a graphics card you cannot run both the integrated graphics and the pci card </s>
<s> after installing the pci card you have to go into the device manager and disable the integrated graphics otherwise all sorts of weird things will happen </s>
<s> after installing the card and its drivers and before disabling the integrated graphics you will have to shut down the computer disconnect the monitor from the integrated graphics connector and connect it to the connector on the new card </s>
<s> then boot into windows and disable the integrated graphics in the device manager and reboot </s>
<s> regarding alang59 s post i have an hp computer too but i didn t encounter the problems that alang59 encountered except the need for a more powerful graphics card with its own gpu and memory </s>
<s> i do a lot of graphics work including video editing and compilations so the integrated graphics were inadequate </s>
<s> it s true that hp only uses integrated graphics that meet the needs of the software and hardware that come with the machine </s>
<s> if you need more graphics rendering capability then you will have to add a graphics card </s>
<s> to solve my problem i bought a new nvidia graphics card </s>
<s> when i opened the computer s case i found that i had two empty pci slots </s>
<s> it was a simple matter of installing the drivers and graphics card connecting the monitor to the new card and disabling the integrated graphics </s>
<s> the only problem i have had related to the new graphics card was when i installed linux in a dual boot configuration </s>
<s> i could not get the nvidia card to work with linux no matter what i did </s>
<s> nvidia did not have linux drivers for my card and the application that is supposed to allow linux to use the windows drivers did not work </s>
<s> all i got was a black screen </s>
<s> it was either uninstall linux or uninstall the nvidia graphics card </s>
<s> i opted to uninstall linux rather than give up the improved graphics that i had gained from the new graphics card </s>
<s> so if you buy an hp computer and you are going to be playing graphics intense games then you may as well include the price of a good graphics card </s>
<s> the user manual should give you the specs for the computer including the total number of pci slots and the number of pci slots that are free as in not being used </s>
<s> also a glance at the back of the tower will be an indicator </s>
<s> the number of blank pci card knock outs will usually be the same as the number of available pci slots </s>
<s> you can also go to hp s web site before you buy the machine and look up the specs for the computer you are thinking of buying </s>
<s> i bought a card with hybrid graphics </s>
<s> i added a video card which works well with the onboard </s>
<s> the one i bought was an ati based card </s>
<s> i recently bought another board with hybrid graphics and this new one needs a seperate card to work it has </s>
<s> it seems that you re a beginner gamer you should ask the shop for the potential of increasing the video card because when you buy an integrated card it is usually not increasable if it is intel video chip but if was from nvidia or ati it is usually expandable but you need to increase the ram because the term integerated means sharing from the computer ram </s>
<s> i hope this explaines a lot of your questions so bottom line ask the shop dealers about everything </s>
<s> i ve experienced this with at least three machines </s>
<s> nowadays new machines arrive without a dedicated video card and an onboard video card that shares the installed memory </s>
<s> as described in the case at hand the onboard video card shares 256mb of the installed ram </s>
<s> it does not have its own ram </s>
<s> in order to get the full benefit of dedicated video card ram one must install a video card with its own ram </s>
<s> this will have two benefits </s>
<s> first the ram installed on the motherboard will not be shared any more and will be fully available for other tasks </s>
<s> second the ram on the video card can be sufficient for whatever video demands are put upon it e g gaming </s>
<s> be sure to get a card with sufficient ram for the intended purposes such as hard core gaming </s>
<s> if you re looking for a system capable of gaming casually or at least having the ability to game casually the integrated graphic processors are seldom sufficient </s>
<s> take a look online at the specs for the system </s>
<s> if you see that the motherboard includes a quot pci express x16 slot quot then you should be able to upgrade the graphics card to some extent so long as the power supply is capable of delivering enough current </s>
<s> the amount of memory on the onboard graphics processor can sometimes be adjusted but using this will quot steal quot from your system memory pool </s>
<s> even if you don t play games a slightly upgraded card can give you a much better experience for 2d desktop work photos video especially if you re looking to watch blu ray and online content since the new versions of flash support gpu acceleration </s>
<s> even so a decent card for all this and some mild gaming doesn t need to cost over 100 and nowadays that will buy a lot of graphics card </s>
<s> even so you still may not have to upgrade </s>
<s> if a game seems to lag try adjusting a few settings </s>
<s> this can make a big difference </s>
<s> an integrated graphics card is the card that comes pre installed with the system s motherboard </s>
<s> while 256 mb of graphics memory will be enough for games that came out 5 years ago it is recommended to have at least 512 mb of graphics memory to play the latest games </s>
<s> if you wish to play the latest games like splinter cell conviction battlefield bad company 2 and mass effect 2 it is recommended to have a nvidia graphics card that supports pixel shader 3 0 and has a graphics memory of 512 mb minimum </s>
<s> i have a nvidia ge force 8400 gs with 512 mb memory and still the latest games run smoothly only at the minimal graphics detail </s>
<s> they start to slow down if i change to medium detail </s>
<s> the most important thing you should consider before buying a graphic card is the manufacturer of the graphics card </s>
<s> most integrated cards are made by intel </s>
<s> intel cards are not supported by most games and hence i am not sure if you can play the latest ones </s>
<s> you can ask your dealer if he can provide you a ati or nvidia graphics card instead of the integrated one </s>
<s> but that can be done only if the pc s motherboard has the provision to install additional graphic cards </s>
<s> just like the normal ram graphics memory too can be increased only if the mother board has the provision to support it </s>
<s> you cannot buy graphics memory like an ordinary ram you need to get a new card with more memory </s>
<s> so you may have to remove one to use the other and its expensive too </s>
<s> i suggest you ask your dealer regarding this </s>
<s> for a good gaming experience i recommend a pc with a nvidia or ati graphics card with atleast 512 mb of ram </s>
<s> visit and for info regarding the price and features of the graphic cards </s>
<s> also don t forget to ask your dealer regarding the provision in the motherboard </s>
<s> i hope you find this useful </s>
<s> if you are not an avid gamer then you should be fine with an integrated graphics card </s>
<s> i have purchased several computers this way and later upgraded to a better graphics card without a problem </s>
<s> almost all motherboards allow you to upgrade to a graphics card over the integrated graphics </s>
<s> when you upgrade enter the computer s bios setup menu when you first turn it on </s>
<s> from there find the option to switch the primary graphics to your new card or disable the integrated graphics </s>
<s> now shut down pop in the card plug your monitor into the new card and restart </s>
<s> windows may look strange on the first boot </s>
<s> uninstall the graphics driver software it used to use and install the new driver software </s>
<s> done </s>
<s> note some system bios will even allow you to use both graphics simultaneously with 2 monitors and your desktop spanning acrross them </s>
<s> there is no real solution other than using dedicated graphics </s>
<s> integrated is great for everyday use but if you plan on having any leisure time and playing games you are going to want a dedicated gfx card just my 2 cents </s>
<s> when you have an integrated video card the memory it uses is subtracted from your main memory </s>
<s> also the stated amount is the maximum amount that can be reserved for the video part there is absolutely no way it can be set higher </s>
<s> the real problem comes when the video circuitry and the cpu have to access the memory </s>
<s> there is only one data bus </s>
<s> the video part need absolute priority access to that buss </s>
<s> that means that whenever the video part is sending data to the screen or treating it the cpu just have to wait </s>
<s> that can reduce your computing performance by up to 80 maybe more in some extreme cases </s>
<s> the system you are contemplating is definitively not up to the task when it comes to newer games and even some older games may not work acceptably </s>
<s> and no 256mb is not exceptional </s>
<s> unless the system can accept another card you can t upgrade that kind of card </s>
<s> those systems often don t have any pcie nor the older agp slot and may not have a pci slot available to connect a real video card </s>
<s> if you are mostly into web surfing emailing text editing simple games and other low performance applications that system is enough </s>
<s> if you want to do heavier stuff you ll soon regret that choice </s>
<s> the other options are discreet video card and having an actual video card </s>
<s> the discreet solution is a built in video card that have it s own ram and internal buss totally separated from the main ram </s>
<s> you can t change that quot card quot as it s a physical part of the motherboard </s>
<s> then there is the actual video cards </s>
<s> both of those solutions don t interfere with the cpu </s>
<s> as you are on a tight budget i can suggest you to build your new computer </s>
<s> that way you can save by reusing some of your older components like the case keyboard monitor and possibly your disk drives </s>
<s> with at least 512mb of graphics memory preferably 1gb </s>
<s> if your dedicated gc goes out and u decided against the integrated you are screwed </s>
<s> just a blank monitor until u go get another card </s>
<s> this is why i always get an integrated gpu but never use it i just use the integrated for back up and whats w you people claiming u cant play any games on integrated </s>
<s> you can play some games such as l4d2 on my 6150se but not on max settings like youd like them to be or any of the newest games </s>
<s> useful for when if your card goes out or is doa </s>
<s> my advice would be to get the integrated card for a back up and then research the card u want best bet would be an nvidia 200 series for a single card setup </s>
<s> you will need at least 512mb of video graphics memory dedicated or quot shared quot in order to play hd video </s>
<s> those integrated graphics chips with 256mb of video memory are simply gutless when it comes to rendering high def video smoothly </s>
<s> therefore you must add a video card that can handle it </s>
<s> check out something like the msi hd4550 an ati radeon model </s>
<s> it s passively cooled so no extra noise from a fanm and it has 1gb of video memory </s>
<s> cost is around 39 99 but we got a mail in rebate for 20 back so it was a heck of a deal </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i would suggest a dell instead you could purchase a dell and get a netbook at a reduce price </s>
<s> simply put yes </s>
<s> you will regret it </s>
<s> integrated graphics take from your system resources because they share the processor and ram along with every other integrated item on the motherboard </s>
<s> now if you simply want to watch a dvd surf the web and check emails then you ll be fine </s>
<s> you ll have no problem with integrated anything if that s all you want to do </s>
<s> if you want to watch blu ray play games and future proof yourself somewhat then you must buy a video card </s>
<s> but so you know you needn t buy the card right this instant for it to function </s>
<s> most video games require the ati hd series cards usually 3000 or better and hp desktops come with the nvidia 6150se chipset and you ll definitely need a 9000 series or a gt200 or better to fully support blu ray and video games </s>
<s> in fact most video games don t even support integrated graphics </s>
<s> 256 mb of ram is pretty good for an integrated chipset but don t expect miracles out of it you won t get far </s>
<s> your best bet is to buy it and enjoy it as much as possible for the time being and when you have the money saved up go and buy the card </s>
<s> once you buy the card you can disable the onboard video to free up some processor and memory resources because the card will handle the bulk of the work </s>
<s> i also recommend buying a 5 1 sound card so you can disable the onboard audio as well </s>
<s> it will also free up system resources </s>
<s> i too have a hp system a compaq but it s made by hp and i upgraded both the video card and audio and let me tell you it was amazing how much faster and smoother the computer operated </s>
<s> the cards will do the bulk of the work and then the processor and memory ram will pick up the slack and you ll notice an overall increase in performance </s>
<s> i highly recommend an upgrade when it s financially possible </s>
<s> first an integrated graphics controller is never as good as a dedicated graphics card especially if you do 3d visualization or play graphics intensive games </s>
<s> but it costs less </s>
<s> however even if you buy a pc with an integrated graphics controller and later on it turns out you don t like it you should be able to install a dedicated graphics card and turn off the onboard controller in the system bios </s>
<s> not certain about this but reasonably sure </s>
<s> second an integrated graphics card saves energy </s>
<s> this does not matter with a desktop but it does make a difference with a laptop if you travel a lot and battery life is an issue </s>
<s> judging a computer based on a single component is a grand waste of time inmo </s>
<s> for example an imac with an integrated graphic card even the lowly ati radeon hd 2100 128mb can do extraordinary things with film editing 3d modeling and yes even gaming </s>
<s> so a more system holistic approach would be better for jose even if games is all he wants to play </s>
<s> hi i have purchased many computers over the years </s>

<s> well now lets be a little careful i once had an acer computer that for the price gave me everything and more than i needed </s>
<s> one problem </s>
<s> most or all of the components are hard wired in </s>
<s> you cannot yes i repeat you cannot replace them or upgrade them without some major surgery </s>
<s> except memory i m not sure that it s true with all acer computers and i don t know why they do it that way </s>
<s> it seems to me that it would be easier just to assemble parts and let it go at that </s>
<s> in the final analysis make sure you contact the compuer manufacturer not always the easiest thing to do and find out if the computer you are interested in is upgradeable and what components or all components are upgradeable </s>
<s> now acer does have a good customer service website so i ve not had a problem adding on some components that hang on outside the computer </s>
<s> after five years it still works fine but it does have its problems occassionally </s>

<s> that will have more power than you need for quite awhile and it has the desktop version of my intel hd graphics set </s>
<s> the 499 model with the celeron 450 single core chip will frustrate you beyond belief </s>
<s> the first thing i did with this 249 laptop was remove the celeron 900 mobile version of the celeron 450 and replace it with a pentium dual core t4300 chip </s>
<s> that and a 3rd gb of memory have really awakened this laptop </s>
<s> i still get about 2 hours on battery but i hardly ever have it not plugged in </s>
<s> if you get the celeron model you will be disappointed </s>
<s> at least get something with a dual core pentium like the 599 model with the pentium e5400 processor </s>
<s> the other 499 computers showing at costco have 6150se or hd4200 graphics </s>

<s> stick to the intel hd for now or be prepared to buy a video card much sooner </s>
<s> motherboards that have chipsets with integrated graphics like for instance the amd 790gx or 890gx don t usually cost much more than many motherboards without integrated graphics in fact the 790fx and 890fx chipsets are more expensive than the gx versions but have no on board video </s>
<s> my advice to you is simply this buy a computer with integrated graphics and spend the extra on that ocz fatal1ty series 650w power supply </s>
<s> that psu will add to your overall system stability regardless </s>
<s> try using the integrated graphics and if they re good enough you can wait until the next best thing comes out and drives current card prices down </s>

<s> sincerely avro arrow former tigerdirect sales rep </s>
<s> intrgrated graphics is a poor choice unless you don t plan on upgrading or play any real games </s>
<s> you need to do real research b4 you give advice and how many ppl have ddr5 speed motherboards anyway </s>
<s> not many so they havent flooded the market with ddr5 memory yet </s>
<s> there arent any games than quot need quot it unless you getting payed to play or in comatition </s>
<s> criysis plays fine on 12 gb ddr3 ram and 2 nvida 9600 oh i also have an i7 procdesser </s>
<s> i said it does not matter cause it is something of a silly question for the vast majority of cases </s>
<s> for all practical purposes they all come with integrated cards </s>
<s> if you buy an upgraded computer with a dedicated card from most of the quot big boys quot they stick a card in an available slot disable the integrated one and if you are lucky they put caps over the integrated connectors so you dont plug the monitor in the wrong hole </s>
<s> if you did not upgrade or buy a higher end model the integrated card stays enabled you paid less money and later you can stick the card of your choice in an available slot and if you are good will cap off the not used holes </s>
<s> try and order a custom upgraded computer from hp or dell etc </s>
<s> and see if you can get them to remove the integrated one </s>
<s> the integrated graphic card no matter how much memory it can share from your ram is still something lackluster </s>
<s> it may play hd video but then not so smoothly with dropping frames from time to time and with high cpu usage </s>
<s> gaming is the last thing you would want to do on those pcs </s>
<s> the latest intel integrated grpahic can t even handle need for speed underground 2 a game released in 2004 with medium detail setting and 1280x960 </s>
<s> as ms office had evolved to more graphic dependent your pc may not be able to run the coming office 2010 smoothly </s>
<s> so think twice </s>
<s> even an entry level graphic card will help a lot say gt210 9400gt etc </s>
<s> avoid integrated graphics unless you simply can t afford anything better </s>
<s> you should be able to upgrade the hp to something better </s>
<s> a decent graphics card will probably cost at least 100 or more if you want something good for gaming or 3d design </s>
<s> the answer to this question is quite simple </s>
<s> first ask yourself this question are you a gamer </s>
<s> if the answer is yes then an integrated graphics card will simply not do </s>
<s> if the answer is no then integrated graphics will be fine </s>
<s> as for the best card my vote is nvidia they simply have better drivers </s>
<s> whatever you decide do it now </s>
<s> graphics cards like everything else move on with time and you may find that in a couple of years the latest cards do not fit into your pc </s>
<s> i have had the same experience and due to slow performance recently decided to add a graphics card to my 3 year old desktop </s>
<s> alas the existing slot is too small for the current available cards </s>
<s> i might as well buy a new pc for the cost of modifications to my existing one </s>
<s> do not procrastinate </s>
<s> i made a similar mistake years ago with a dell dimension 2350 integrated graphics only </s>
<s> at the time i didn t understand what that meant and some games would not work </s>
<s> however the pc is still in use the story is blogged here </s>
<s> most lower end motherboards and computers come with integrated graphics </s>
<s> unless you build your own or buy a higher end system that is what you will get </s>
<s> if in fact you plan on upgrading your graphics card to a pcie card then you will in fact regret it because the number one thing less expensive systems without dedicated video cards do is put in a cheap power supply usually without a pcie hookup anyway so to upgrade the video you will also have to upgrade the power supply </s>
<s> trust me you will have to buy a new power supply and a new video card if you want to upgrade </s>
<s> we are assuming the system you are buying has a pci express video card slot if it doesn t once again you will regret buying it you are already talking about graphic intensive games so my bottom line is yes you will regret it </s>
<s> you get what you pay for </s>
<s> buying a new pc or motherboard always raises many questions </s>
<s> if the pc or motherboard you are wanting already has an integrated graphics feature fear not </s>
<s> for most applications other than gaming or high end business graphics use an integrated solution is usually perfectly adequate </s>
<s> however if you subsequently decide it s not quite up to the job you can fit a separate graphics card and turn off the integrated graphics from within the bios </s>
<s> read the mobo manual to see how to access that it varies between makers and versions and then how to turn off the integrated graphics feature </s>
<s> even mobos with integrated graphics provide either an agp or pci express slot for the new card </s>
<s> then you re good to go with your new graphics card on a reboot </s>
<s> hope that clears up some of the confusing posts </s>
<s> i wasnot surprised at the high proportoin of people who prioritised graphics in their buying decisions what alarmed me was the huge percentage who either did not lnow or perhaps care what signficiance was held by graphics </s>
<s> this means that pc vendors don t need to poull the wool over our eyes we re already wearing mohair spectacles </s>
<s> i purchased a sony with an intel i 3 in february that had the 256mb video card </s>
<s> this week i took delivery of a lenovo with the intel i 7 and a 1gb video card </s>
<s> there was a 550 price difference </s>
<s> instead of worrying about how much you re getting i d reconsider the brand of choice first </s>
<s> look up how many people are complaining about this problem or that because they shopped with dollar amount price being their first concern </s>
<s> you ll always get burned in the end when that s your biggest concern </s>
<s> guess what quality still counts and when the price is to good to beat it might be just because that s the only way that brand can sell them in the first place </s>
<s> only you can decide if you think quality is worth more </s>
<s> i firmly believe in it </s>
<s> the 256mb card is just fine for normal internet type applications and i m having nothing but pure joy with it but when i found a new machine just 4 months later that had 4 times the amount i jumped at it </s>
<s> hold off till you can get a bit higher end machine and you ll always get longer use out of it in the end </s>
<s> another consideration is weight </s>
<s> the reason i got the sony was because it only weighs 4 1 2 pounds so i can carry it anywhere but my desktop replacement is a lot more machine that i ll pretty much leave set up and leave it alone </s>
<s> no machine does it all </s>
<s> instead ask yourself how you re going to use it the most and then decide how much you care about how long it will last without it breaking down or wearing out </s>
<s> while i normally don t get this stupid with my money i know that both machines i ve purchased this year will still be meeting 90 of all my needs in 3 years and in all likelihood still be decent machines </s>
<s> to me the higher up front costs are worth the longer usage i ll get out of them overall </s>
<s> trust me there are decent values on higher quality machines out there so this time i d either pay a bit more or hold off till i could afford it </s>
<s> if this new computer is a laptop then you ll be trapped with the card if its a desktop then you might be able to upgrade to a real video card later </s>
<s> my advice would be to do abit of research find out exactly what model the store is selling and look it up online see if it has any extra sockets for additions ie pcie x1 pcie x4 pcie x16 keep in mind those are different socket sizes used by different cards </s>
<s> usually most storebought ones come with a dialup modem card which can be removed and replaced with a different type card </s>
<s> just pay attention to the type of card slots your new system will have and what kind of card slot your new video card if when you decide to invest in one requires </s>
<s> same if you intend to go wireless or look into a tv tuner better sound card etc </s>
<s> another recommendation would be to check out reviews on the system your interested in just incase there s alot of complaints issues with the make model </s>
<s> wish ya luck with the new compy once you find one you like </s>
<s> i have a major problem with that word quot absolute quot </s>
<s> you can only upgrade to a better graphics card if the motherboard has an upgrade slot </s>
<s> that is not necessarily the case </s>
<s> it has been a while since i upgraded my computers but the last time i looked there were motherboards out there that did not have a graphics slot </s>
<s> i also have not bought a full production case since my first 25mhz 486 gateway </s>
<s> i have gone the upgrade route ever since that first computer and looked for the best buy available for the money for only the components i required what was broken or about to die </s>
<s> first of all i recommend considering a different computer altogether </s>
<s> hp computers have a long and sad history of poor tech support underpowered components and poor performance </s>
<s> i would recommend looking at better computers like dell acer or even gateway which is not a lot better than hp compaq but at least has decent customer service </s>
<s> i also recommend not buying computers from deep discount places like costco </s>
<s> with a few exceptions the people who work in those places know nothing about computers and cannot answer your questions </s>
<s> also they do not have any good computer repair nor maintenance services </s>
<s> i d recommend getting your computer from places like best buy frys or even better yet a shop that sells nothing but computers </s>
<s> check to see if your town has any specialty shops that only sell computers </s>
<s> the more specialized a shop is the better their service and support after the sale tends to be </s>
<s> sure it may cost a bit more at the outset but at least you ll have some support for your computer after the sale </s>
<s> getting a computer is kind of like getting a car any after the sale customer service the place you get it from offers is very important because trust me you will have issues with any computer you get sooner or later just like we do with the cars we buy </s>
<s> really the kind of graphics card that any desktop computer comes with is irrelevant because they are almost always way underpowered for playing video games </s>
<s> you have to get one of those specialty brand towers from companies like alienware or ibuypower to get a good quot out of the box quot gaming experience </s>
<s> what does matter when buying a computer as far as graphics goes is how many expansion card slots the computer s motherboard comes with and what kind they are </s>
<s> look for computers with at least one pci express aka pcie slot </s>
<s> that is where you ll put your more powerful graphics card that you ll buy separately </s>
<s> what also matters when getting a computer that will run a good video card is cooling </s>
<s> find a computer with the largest vents in the front of the case that you can </s>
<s> if you can find one that also has a vent in the side and even better on the top of the case that is even better </s>
<s> if there are no fans in these vents that is okay because it is easy to install fans in those vents later </s>
<s> good performing video cards get hotter than weak cards and need good ventilation to perform properly </s>
<s> when you get your separate video card connect your computer to the internet and download the newest drivers for whatever video card you buy separately </s>
<s> usually you can do a search for the name of the graphics chip maker usually either ati or nvidia </s>
<s> if you get an ati card you ll end up on the amd website since they are the parent company of ati now </s>
<s> do a search within that website for the model of video card you bought and download but do not install the drivers for it yet </s>
<s> just save the file folder to your desktop or downloads folder so you can find it again </s>
<s> before you install the drivers click on start then control panel then device manager </s>
<s> scroll down the list of devices until you find the integrated video card </s>
<s> right click on the name of the card and click on quot disable quot </s>
<s> once you have the integrated graphics card disabled shut down the computer completely and unplug it </s>
<s> put on an antistatic wrist strap most computer stores sell them for around 15 or less </s>
<s> they keep you from frying your new computer with static shock and are well worth getting before you open up your computer </s>
<s> set it down on a flat hard clean surface like a table </s>
<s> open up the box that the separate video card came in and remove the card from the package </s>
<s> do not touch the gold like connectors on the bottom of the card as oils from your skin can damage them </s>
<s> also avoid putting any pressure on the cooling fan if the card has one as you could damage the motor </s>
<s> you ll probably have to remove a panel or two from the back of the computer tower so that the video ports are visible from the back of the tower speaking of video ports most of today s video cards come with dvi ports which are usually white and have slots running both vertically and horizontally </s>
<s> if your monitor is older than two or three years it probably has a vga plug on it usually blue and with a bunch of round pins in it </s>
<s> if the card doesn t come with an adapter you ll need a vga to dvi adapter for older monitors </s>
<s> when putting the video card into the computer make sure there are no wires in the way of the slot before you push it down in there </s>
<s> also check to see if the card requires additional power </s>
<s> there will be a port usually on the short side of the card opposite the side with the monitor ports where you ll plug this power cable into </s>
<s> if the power supply that came with the computer is powerful enough it should have a cord for this port </s>
<s> if not you ll need to buy a different power supply that has cords for video cards on it </s>
<s> most of the power supplies that are 300 watts or more these days come with the needed cords </s>
<s> install the more powerful power supply if needed first before you install the graphics card </s>
<s> be sure to push the video card into the slot until it clicks there is usually a lock of some kind to keep the card from wiggling loose on most motherboards these days </s>
<s> also be sure to screw the card s metal retaining bracket to the case frame to help support it </s>
<s> when you put the case s door back on never run a computer with the case door off as it defeats the cooling system of the case and leads to overheating plug in and restart the computer </s>
<s> when windows tries to reinstall the pc s integrated graphics card click on quot cancel quot </s>
<s> if you don t click on cancel in time disable the integrated card again as described above </s>
<s> now find the driver you downloaded and install it </s>
<s> you ll probably have to restart the computer to finish the install </s>
<s> also don t buy a desktop pc that is smaller than quot mid tower quot size </s>
<s> avoid the ones that are thin and that lay on their longest side </s>
<s> avoid the ones that are shorter than most of the other ones too </s>
<s> those quot space saving quot form factors are really hard to find graphics cards for </s>
<s> they take the shorter cards which are usually pci or even agp rather than the faster pci express cards </s>
<s> i found this out the hard way by buying a sony quot micro tower quot pc a few years ago </s>
<s> the case looked cool but by being a few inches shorter than the typical mid tower size i had to settle for getting an nvidia card that used an agp slot </s>
<s> those older tech cards are not as fast nor able to render graphics of today s games as well as those that use the pci express slot </s>
<s> another important thing to consider when buying a computer that you might play today s games on is even more overlooked than the included graphics the power supply </s>
<s> most pc makers skimp on parts as much as they can to make a bigger profit </s>
<s> one of the ways they do this is by putting the lowest power of power supply in the tower that they can get away with </s>
<s> if you are getting a video card separately from the pc which anyone wanting to play anything more advanced than online browser games should do then you ll need a higher wattage of powersupply than what your computer comes with </s>
<s> most decent video cards require at least a 300 watt powersupply but check the box of the video card you are thinking of getting to make sure </s>
<s> considering all the other stuff your computer will be powering i always up the wattage of a power supply that i include in a computer by two or three hundred watts over what the video card requires </s>
<s> you mentioned thinking that 256 mb memory for a graphics card was quot pretty hefty quot </s>
<s> it used to be but not any more </s>
<s> today s video games have such advanced graphics that you ll actually get fairly poor performance from a 256 mb card with most of them </s>
<s> i d recommend getting a video card with at least 512 mb of ddr ram </s>
<s> if you can afford it go for one with 512 of ddr2 ram as ddr2 is even faster than ddr </s>
<s> stay away from video cards made by anybody other than the actual graphics chip makers </s>
<s> sure they are a bit cheaper but there is usually a reason for that </s>
<s> the cards that are not made by either nvidia or ati do not seem to last as long and they tend to have poorer tech support and not as user friendly interfaces for their software </s>
<s> with graphics cards you really do get what you pay for </s>
<s> one of the best quot bang for your buck quot video cards on the market today is the nvidia geforce 8700 it makes use of direct x 10 and has all the processing power needed to run the latest games </s>
<s> yet it is no longer the very newest card out there making it more affordable than the newer cards like the nvidia 9000 series </s>
<s> finally no matter what computer you get keep it clean </s>
<s> at least once a year once a month if you have pets smoke and or are using the computer in a dusty environment open up the case and blow out the dust hair etc with canned air </s>
<s> you might even need to put on your anti static wrist strap mentioned above and take a cotton swab qtip dipped in rubbing alcohol never use any other liquid inside a computer and wipe off some of the more stubborn stuff </s>
<s> you ll need to remove the front panel to really get all of the stuff out at least every other cleaning if you do it monthly </s>
<s> computers draw in air from the front and blow it out the back to cool themselves </s>
<s> there is all kinds of dust pollen hair etc floating in the air </s>
<s> when this air gets sucked into the computer that stuff settles out of the air and sticks to the parts inside the computer </s>
<s> over time the stuff builds up and insulates the parts keeping them from cooling off properly </s>
<s> when computers act slower than they used to and especially when they shut off for no apparent reason it s very often due to the fact that the computer s parts are getting too hot </s>
<s> your new computer will last longer and run faster if you keep it clean </s>
<s> just some tips from someone who has built several pcs and upgraded the graphics of hundreds of pcs </s>
<s> i like to change out ram add ram video cards sound cards and this can t be done with an intergrated machine </s>
<s> for all of you who don t really know what intergrated means everything is built into one unit and it s not meant to be tampered with and that is why a non intergrated machine is best if you can afford one </s>
<s> intergraded computers are more reasonably priced and you get what you pay for </s>
<s> denise </s>
<s> when buying a new pc and considering upgrading the video card make sure the power supply on the pc you are buying will handle the additional power demand </s>
<s> most big box store pc s have 250 300 watt power supplies </s>
<s> many graphics card required 350 or larger power supplies </s>
<s> i purchased a hp media center pc with integrated graphics </s>
<s> i was shopping for its processor pentium d 3 4g mainly as they were cheap at the time as the core duo just came out </s>
<s> its on board graphics were ok but i knew if i wanted to game a new card would be required </s>
<s> i added this into my budget before i bought </s>
<s> hp is a little odd with the hard drive access but there should be an open slot for a new video card </s>
<s> in my case i added a video card and a tv tuner card as well </s>
<s> just check the specs for the motherboard and look it up </s>
<s> you will easily be able to find a picture on line </s>
<s> then its pretty much unscrew 2 srews insert card re screw load drivers turn off old video in task manager </s>
<s> 30 min max </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> even if your on a tight budget you can purchase dedicated cards that are 50 bucks and under that will give you everything you need and more also your stuck with a vga monitor connection on almost all integrated gpus dvi or digital connection that is on almost all dedicated gpus is by far the way to go with all today s great picture quality options remember you do not have to remove your intergrated setup to add a dedicated at any time that s what i did and if my gpu ever breaks i still can go back to the on board graphics </s>
<s> i love notebooks never buy desktops </s>
<s> i currently have a sony vgnfw250j notebook </s>
<s> in buying a new notebook laptop what keywords do i look for re reasonably fast not sure what that translates to graphic cards </s>
<s> and what are the tradeoffs papabear mommabear babybear </s>
<s> thanks vmars316 </s>
<s> first of all check if the video graphics chipset onto the mainboard of such hp machine has an integraded graphics processor with a fan hooked onto it and an fsb of at least 800mhz 1600 or 2200mhz preferable </s>
<s> second make sure it comes with a minimum of 3 4mb of ram cards that both cards are dual channel synchronized perfectly both the same speed </s>
<s> third the bad news is too cheap lands you a complete dud of a machine </s>
<s> especially via hewlett packard u s a or even canada </s>
<s> hint good games will need a 512mb video chipset with a really reliable graphics processor to back it up </s>
<s> plus having the graphics processor complete and undeniable dedication to video graphics rendition of both video clips movies and gaming </s>
<s> a 500 machine through hp will land you a dud </s>
<s> look somewhere else for much better </s>
<s> good luck at choosing the next big upgrade </s>
<s> i meant 3 to 4 gigabytes of ram and not a mere 3 to 4 megabytes </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> sli is 2 or even 3 dedicated graphics cards </s>
<s> you cannot bridge the onboard graphic chipset with an add on graphics card for dual support </s>
<s> in fact you would disable the onboard graphics chip in order to use a dedicated video card </s>
<s> also most motherboards in store bought systems are not high end but usually entry level motherboards </s>
<s> an important consideration to look at before buying one of these systems is whether it even has room to add a video card in some don t </s>
<s> integrated graphics doesn t mean that one cannot simply in most cases add a second graphics card in an open pci slot and disable the graphics that came attached to the motherboard </s>
<s> then you just need to know to which vga port you attach your monitor to </s>
<s> amd is coming up with its fusion technology that combine cpu and gpu technology to create what we call apu acclelerated processor unit </s>
<s> amd is the first to fuse graphics and central processing units in one single chip </s>
<s> graphics will be much speedier because graphics will lockstep with central processor instead of relying on slower memory speed </s>
<s> just check it out at for more information and which model that will comes with fusion chips and where to buy them </s>
<s> intel is dominant in integrated graphic market where graphics chips are soldered on motherboards to make it integrated and connected to whatever ram modules you have be it ddr ddr2 or ddr3 </s>
<s> it is not as fast as amd fusion chips </s>
<s> you can still add graphics cards to amd fusion to boost graphics performance even further </s>
<s> i read that the fusion chips will use ati 42 circuitry which is pretty recent </s>
<s> amd bought ati graphics in 2005 so to unite both technologies in one single cpu or so called apu </s>
<s> integrated graphics is not found inside cpus but in its own separate chip on the motherboard </s>
<s> amd fusion chips will not need any integrated graphics chips on the motherboard as graphics circuitry will be fused with central processing circuitry on the same clock </s>
<s> ddr3 memory is not as fast as central processing clock so that is why amd fusion chips promises to be very exciting for the masses with limited funds to buy the most bang for the buck </s>
<s> learn all you can about the coming amd fusion chips just around the corner </s>
<s> i agree with the posts that mention adding a video card later if need be </s>
<s> it is a simple install and inexpensive </s>
<s> so if you have found a pc that meets all of your needs and budget buy it but make sure you can add a video card later </s>
<s> happy pc ing chris </s>
<s> excellent points made </s>
<s> very well thought out and expressed </s>
<s> most new quot name brand quot desktops come with the barest minimum in power supplies </s>
<s> these are usually not enough for adding a new video card so you can almost plan on the extra price and hassle of changing the power supply out for a more powerful one that will support the new video card </s>
<s> h p dell gateway e machines all fall into this category </s>
<s> also most of these brands come with entry level motherboards </s>
<s> make sure that the system you buy has the extra slots and also the available room inside to add a dedicated video card </s>
<s> open slots is one thing a good video card though usually takes two slot positions and could be longer </s>
<s> watch for both of these </s>
<s> the mid tower suggestion is very good in this respect but also watch the included motherboard is it a micro atx or a standard atx motherboard </s>
<s> be careful to ensure that expansion is possible if you even think you may like to try newer games </s>
<s> in the south one doesn t want a pc that generates a lot of heat </s>
<s> i have a pc new this year with integrated graphics running on a 300 watt power supply </s>
<s> the pc heat factor in my office is noticeably reduced </s>
<s> the system is great for office software editing photos watching hulu com or games that are not too demanding of video like civilization iv </s>
<s> when you add a video card you re adding 70 to 250 watts of power consumption </s>
<s> something to think about </s>
<s> i have an hp with an integrated graphic card </s>
<s> it was slow and used system memory </s>
<s> i plugged in a new graphic card and got much cleaner images faster rebuilds etc </s>
<s> but you can t depend on the device manager to keep the old integrated card disabled and you can t trust a machine whose nature has been preset to work with an integrated card </s>
<s> you upgrade this change that load a new game etc </s>
<s> preferences get changed automatically and the old graphic card is activitated stealing memory slowing things down etc or the machine out of habit supports the old card as well as the new </s>
<s> if you know you re going to run a faster separate card eventually get a machine running a separate card already </s>
<s> it ll be in its nature and you may avoid the lovely conflicts that arise among plug in cards </s>
<s> a limited number of compatible motherboard chipsets and gpus using hybrid sli geforce boost can indeed combine the power of the onboard gfx and dedicated gpu </s>
<s> ahh system integration less is more and the simplicity of having it all in one unit </s>
<s> this is the way computers should be built right </s>
<s> maybe or maybe not </s>
<s> the thing about integrated parts such as video is this what if </s>
<s> what if the card is such a drag on the system it actually drags the system down many cards actually share system memory and if you have slower memory modules such as 533 667 it can be a drag if you play some games </s>
<s> then there are the obvious what if s </s>
<s> what if its upgrade time now it sits idle in the system doing nothing </s>
<s> also lets keep in mind the inevitable failure what do you do now </s>
<s> well now you have to purchase a card anyway </s>
<s> thats if you are lucky enough to have it only be the video go and not take the nb controller as well happened to me a few weeks ago </s>
<s> a half way decent card should be no more than about 99 and some more power dual processor cards can round the 500 and beyond range </s>
<s> however most systems now disable the onboard cards once the external graphics card is found thus freeing board resources </s>
<s> and free means fast </s>
<s> so we have a dedicated processor for graphics dedicated memory for graphics and less drag on the system cpu to do more of what we designed the thing to do in the first place but ultimately the choice is to the user some manufacturers are already completely removing integrated graphics cards once again </s>
<s> in light of this single dilemma to go external or not </s>
<s> i would steer clear of anything that has a hp logo run runaway fast from that logo </s>
<s> i was suckered into getting one and have regreted evrything about it </s>
<s> i have the hp pavilion slimline s3020n and cannot do most of the updates for windows vista premium home edition </s>
<s> here s the fix for that though </s>
<s> adding more memory som my question to hp that has never been answered is if you know the problem exists then why not charge the small amount extra so no extra fix would be needed </s>
<s> the customer support is average but stll is mainly self directed </s>
<s> bottom line is look elsewhere for a slightly better unit without have to add on fixes later </s>
<s> that would drive up the after market price </s>
<s> from david in texas </s>
<s> one thing else to keep in mind is that all of the new graphic cards require a 300watt minimum power supply </s>
<s> all of the hp s and gateways that i have looked at have a 250watt power supply so a power supply upgrade may be in order </s>
<s> then of course you have to consider the motherboard to see if it can handle a higher power supply </s>
<s> motherboards tips for judging quality hardware secrets feb 12 2010 gabriel torres is the editor in chief of hardware secrets a us based website about pc hardware with more and more components being integrated inside the computer cpu the motherboard doesnt affect the system performance as much as it used to just a few years ago </s>
<s> so what makes a given motherboard a good motherboard </s>
<s> there are features of course </s>
<s> the number of memory sockets the number of expansion slots the support for sli and crossfire configurations the number of sata ports the presence of esata ports the number of usb ports the presence of digital audio outputs spdif raid support overclocking options and especially right now the presence of new technologies such as sata 600 a k a </s>
<s> sata 6 g and usb 3 0 but if you are buying a motherboard and find two or more products with similar features which one you should buy </s>
<s> one answer might be the one with the best quality </s>
<s> but how can you tell the quality of a motherboard </s>
<s> there are a few small details on motherboards that reveal a lot about their overall quality </s>
<s> the first one is the quality of the electrolytic capacitors that are used on the motherboard </s>
<s> many years ago some manufacturers used low cost capacitors that leaked after some time leading the computer to behave erratically and even damage the motherboard </s>
<s> since then several manufacturers started using capacitors that are immune to such leakage </s>
<s> one of the best kind of capacitor uses polymer type also known as solid </s>
<s> they are easy to spot the look like small aluminum cans </s>
<s> then the second best are the ones manufactured in japan brands include nihon chemi con rubycon sanyo matsushita panasonic and hitachi </s>
<s> the second clue to quality is the kind of chokes coils used on the voltage regulator circuit which is located close to the cpu socket </s>
<s> these chokes can use ferrite or iron in their core </s>
<s> both are squared components measuring approximately 3 8 x 3 8 1 cm x 1 cm but ferrite chokes are closed while iron chokes are opened </s>
<s> so if you see a bunch of gray or black square components near the cpu socket without a coil inside of it showing up you are seeing a ferrite choke otherwise you are facing an iron choke </s>
<s> ferrite chokes are better than iron chokes </s>
<s> then we have the number of phases of the voltage regulator circuit think of a phase as being like a piston in a car engine </s>
<s> the more phases the voltage regulator has the better because each transistor present on this circuit will work less thus producing less heat </s>
<s> the less heat your motherboard produces the better for its life span and of course temperature inside the computer </s>
<s> a high number of phases also increases the motherboard efficiency i e </s>
<s> it consumes less energy </s>
<s> but how can you tell the number of phases from a motherboard </s>
<s> by counting the number of chokes available each choke is connected to one phase </s>
<s> however current cpus require several voltages to work so the voltage regulator circuit will have separated phases for each voltage </s>
<s> for instance on motherboards designed for cpus with integrated memory controllers all amd cpus and core i3 core i5 and core i7 from intel the voltage regulator will produce two distinct voltages one for the cpu core and another one for the memory controller </s>
<s> in this case the motherboard manufacturer may say that the voltage regulator circuit is for example a 6 2 design meaning six phases for the cpu core and two phases for the integrated memory controller </s>
<s> motherboards targeted to the new intel cpus with integrated video controller need to produce three different voltages the third one being to the cpu integrated video processor so manufacturers announce the voltage regulator circuit like 6 1 1 </s>
<s> so when comparing motherboards you should buy the one with more phases </s>
<s> some manufacturers however use a higher switching frequency on their voltage regulator circuit what makes one phase to be more efficient than several phases from competing products </s>
<s> manufacturers that offer this kind of solution on their products advertise this very clearly on the product specs page </s>
<s> motherboards do not have on board graphics by bill3 a very simple way of getting a good motherboard for a novice is stick to asus and gigabyte others are good too who have very good reputations for quality win many awards for excellence and you can clearly see the evidence of this tutorial when examining their boards </s>
<s> of course the more you pay the better you get </s>
<s> my personal recommendation is never never never have on board graphics because 1 graphics are very highly sophisticated expensive and stressed section of a computer </s>
<s> 2 if on board graphics die they can kill the motherboard too so your in for a complete rebuild </s>
<s> 3 on board graphics only come on cheap motherboards </s>
<s> 4 on board graphics consume much expense in the construction so both the motherboard itself and the graphics have to be made cheap and nasty </s>
<s> 5 with no graphics manufacturers charge from nearly double for their motherboards so this must really show that there is a whole lot more to a good motherboard </s>
<s> 6 computers with separate graphics cards always have a much nicer picture for xp </s>
<s> 7 computers with separate graphics cards always have a much nicer picture for games and more of them will run on your computer </s>
<s> 8 with a separate graphics card you can remove and upgrade it to run a higher specification game </s>
<s> however if on board graphics die you can put a graphics card in and usually get the computer working again </s>
<s> also there are heaps of people who just want a cheap reasonable computer and they run just fine with on board graphics but not with the same performance as the separate graphics card computers </s>
<s> it has been mention numerous times that memory is not the key component for graphics but the graphics cpu chip or gpu is the key component </s>
<s> now i will also agree that your question is quot mute quot most pcs come with an integrated graphics card and most motherboards have a pci e slot or regular pci slot where you can install your own graphics card so search the net for that pc and see if find out if the motherboard has an extra slot for graphics </s>
<s> and yes a mid level graphic card a few year s old between 80 150 w rebate will handle all your needs unless you are a gamer and gamers are never satisfied they will always upgrdae </s>
<s> when i brought my e machine pc now retired back in 2003 the integrated card handle everything i threw at it and play all my son s games which were a few years old </s>
<s> in six months i purchase a seperate card so he could play newer games </s>
<s> and on my current system i ordered it with a graphics card so he could play all his games </s>
<s> so find out if it has a slot and don t worry </s>
<s> when you buy a card to play it safe buy 512 mbyte of ram and if affordable buy 1 gbyte ram to ease your worries </s>
<s> not trying to be one of those pia grammar police posters but since you put it in quotes i was compelled to correct </s>
<s> i think you meant moot as no longer applicapble or relevant rather than mute </s>
<s> in an otherwise intelligent post i know i appreciate if someone points out i use a word wrong don t appreciate it when it s just typo as we all do that when our fingers can t keep up with our brains </s>
<s> see i did it myself lt holding head in shame gt </s>
<s> lt lt i would steer clear of anything that has a hp logo run runaway fast from that logo gt gt yes and double that for acer </s>
<s> my first pc was an hp </s>
<s> i replaced the power supply and bought a gpu 8600 gt that same day i bought it </s>
<s> i liked it and it served me while but i build my own pcs now </s>
<s> the final product can have better quality hardware at a lower cost than if you purchased it pre built </s>
<s> i will admit that it takes some technical know how and a lot of homework but to me it s worth it </s>
<s> i will never buy another pre built pc again </s>
<s> if you have windows and plan to use your pc for multi media graphic cards are must </s>
<s> so unlikely you d regret </s>
<s> on the other hand if you plan to use linux for os you may not require it again depending you your requirement </s>
<s> linux has it in inbuild </s>
<s> just my 2cents cerine </s>
<s> jerk </s>
<s> the days in which a motherboard came with an onboard video and no video slot are long gone but cheapskate systems still exist </s>
<s> adding a separate video card will be easy just plug it in the problem will be in making use of it to the full </s>
<s> cheap pc s with onboard video usually have weaker than normal components so even if you add an excellent video card later the pc will still struggle to run a demanding game </s>
<s> if you re not a gamer then yes by all means buy a cheaper pc and upgrade it later </s>
<s> otherwise you will be disappointed of the results </s>
<s> from my experience though note i m not a serious gamer the integrated graphics have proven sufficient and are continually improving </s>
<s> 256mb is quite a jump up from most of the systems i have owned </s>
<s> my current compaq laptop by hp has 256mb integrated and handles dvd and itunes movie playback in hi def with no problems </s>
<s> and of course as many have said already switching to a dedicated graphics card later is quite easy and can be fairly inexpensive </s>
<s> i have seen 1gb graphics cards as low as the 20 bracket </s>
<s> if you have the model number of the computer you re looking at you can go to the support section at hp com and pull up virtually anything you want to know about it </s>
<s> the pci slot you d need is pretty much standard equipment on their desktops </s>
<s> everybody has their favorite brands and you ve heard from a few here </s>
<s> for my two cents worth on that across several computers desktops and laptops over the past 15 years i have owned more hp s than anything else </s>
<s> they have proven more durable than anything else and their customer support when i have needed it has been excellent </s>
<s> i highly recommend the hp brand including compaq </s>
<s> over the years i ve owned three hp desktops and did one custom homebuilt all excellent for their day </s>
<s> being a career truck driver i was happy to see the desktop replacement class of laptops come along much better suited to my travelling lifestyle </s>
<s> am now on my second hp compaq laptop a year old the first one survived four years of hard and heavy road use and was still going when i sold it </s>
<s> in between those two i used an acer for three years and still have it as a backup </s>
<s> also went through three toshiba s which started out mediocre and got progressively worse </s>
<s> the future needs of computers are growing and you might regret it integrated card in my opinion would do in no more than internet browsing and simpliest tasks like typing in word editing software </s>
<s> all you had to do is buy a newer and better motherboard and transfer everything to it </s>
<s> as long as there is a pci e 16x slot for dedicated graphics expansion you can then add a dedicated graphics card for as little as 50 or as much as 500 at a later date i noticed quot unlimited computers quot input and your opinion although just an opinion and not at all correct and you mentioned the issue you had with amd cpu s you must be the only person that has had this issue because ive primarily used amd cpu s over the last 10 years and they not only don t run too hot they give almost the exact performance of any comparable intel cpu but at 50 to 75 less cost if your on a budget do not buy intel they cost too much and provide too little for the difference in price check online on any forums for proof i think the last time the person below bought a pc was when amd just started to compete with intel things have certainly changed dramatically since the 90 s my friend </s>
<s> that s why research is so important because many people give misleading information because they re lacking in pc building skill don t know any better or just got a bad product </s>
<s> take for example the newest intel 6 core cpu selling for 1000 to 1500 and the comparable amd 6 core cpu is 250 to 300 but performs within 10 of the speed why is this because it has nothing to do with overheating at all just the fact intel is very overpriced but not that much better in performance read any online comparisons and decide for yourself of course </s>
<s> i really do hope that it is a triple or quadruple core based of a packaged machine from a renowned chain of franchises of an electronics store </s>
<s> even if it cant handle the games its a good back up if any card you buy goes bad </s>
<s> just do not disable the on board video in the bios cause if you do and the addin card goes bad you will not have any video adapter to use your computer till you buy a new identical card </s>
<s> yes id say categorically that you sooner or later will regret the integrated video card </s>
<s> most modern games demand much more horsepower in order to run smoothly </s>
<s> on the other hand if you have a stationary unit you can always add a decent video card later </s>
<s> if it is a laptop you usually don t get a second chance </s>
<s> good luck dim sweden </s>
