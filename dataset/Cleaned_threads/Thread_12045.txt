<s> i have a hard drive enclosure connected via usb </s>
<s> it was working fine all along </s>
<s> i had to disconnect it to move my computer and when i hooked it back up the drive letter doesn t appear </s>
<s> when i go into my device manager it shows up and when i click quot properties quot it says quot this device is working properly quot any advice </s>
<s> its a western digital wd300bb </s>
<s> i am running xp pro </s>
<s> if you remember then that s it </s>
<s> fixes include software like getdataback and zero assumption recovery </s>
<s> i take it you put it back in the same usb socket another socket and have powered down the entire as part of your troubleshooting </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i had tried a couple of different usb ports with no result </s>
<s> but i had neglected to try a different usb wire </s>
<s> i did and the disk booted up and all the data is there </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> what i do with said cable </s>
<s> it s promptly repurposed here but most should cut it in two and toss it </s>
<s> such cables can cause data corruption later even if it appears to work </s>
<s> may i add that was good troubleshooting on your part </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> its back to square one </s>
<s> the thunderstorms in the ne knocked out my power and when i booted back up its doing the same thing </s>
