<s> i just have a quick question </s>
<s> does anyone know if these printers that say direct usb photo printing or pc free photo printing will also print documents </s>
<s> i ve got no experience with this and can t confirm it either way </s>
<s> i know the more expensive ones will print documents but i am hoping to find a sub 200 multifunction printer that can print documents via a usb flash drive </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> it should certainly be in the specs if they were able to render an xxx document for xxx read pdf docx wordperfect 9 abiword odt xlsx etc without a pc to tell them about the fonts and having the word or excel or wordperfect or openoffice reader to do the rendering work </s>
<s> which means i don t think it exists </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> it is not possible for doc printing on such a printer today because the rendering of the doc depends on the user s printer settings in windows the fonts on the host machine that can affect rendering and more </s>
<s> pdf can side step this so can you use pdf </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks that makes sense </s>
<s> i did end up calling hp and epson </s>
<s> epson said no but the hp guy told me that their officejet 8500aplus can print pdf s and maybe doc files </s>
<s> he said you can email doc files to the printer </s>
<s> i don t know but it makes sense about the fonts and other rendering issues </s>
<s> if i get one and try it i ll update this thread with the results </s>
<s> thanks guys or girls </s>
<s> the main reason for these printers as i know it is to provide pc free access to print </s>
<s> in other words no pc is needed it is a quot stand alone quot device which is great as you to place some memory card or such and allow the printer to start a quot photo print quot from that source </s>
<s> what you want or appears is basically a dual mode operation </s>
<s> in effect a printer as always attached to a pc but has the provided ports to attach a memory card and start printing again on its own </s>
<s> what if available is entirely should be explained in the specs of the printer reviewed </s>
<s> if attached as a pc type printer you would think it still prints from the pc side as before but if on a memory card will it </s>
<s> that s the question you wanted answered </s>
<s> this would be a feature they would want listed </s>
<s> if all it provides is photo output when on memory card then no docs etc is supported </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
