<s> i custom builted my pc in hong kong the chasis i purchased isn t very study in fact i s quite cheap anywho i ve noticed a very serious problem with the power button on the front of my pc </s>
<s> the power button itself is about the size of a thumb but what s so bad about it is that it s too sensitive </s>
<s> i ve never noticed it before but this morning when i turned on my pc i only touch the button lightly and boom my pc powers on i didn t even push the button all the way in i just touch it and my pc is already on now to me this is very serious and worries me quite alot </s>
<s> i m worry that my pc might fry becasue of it i had an old hp i rememebr when i push the power button once but my hands were abit shaky so when i push the button once the button was actually pushed twice causing the pc to rapidly turn on and off then back on again then before i know it my hp fried up and was dead it was unrepaiable </s>
<s> now i m worried that the sam thing might happen again on my new pc if the button is so sensitive if my hands got shaky again when i push it won t my new pc fried like my old hp </s>
<s> i have a very cheap psu and that makes things worst and me more worried below is my pc spec psu 250 watts p4 2 6 asus mobo 1gb ram 80gb sata hd geforce 6600 liteon dvd rom live on dvd burner tv card so i want to know if my old hp took 3 rapid restarts to break will it happened again if my hands got shaky and i push that very sensitive power button on my new pc </s>
<s> i m very worried please help me t_t </s>
<s> yes get a new chassi </s>
<s> no not blow up but destroy your motherboard </s>
<s> best regardes thomas persson it doktor </s>
<s> in an atx system </s>
<s> it is a momentary contact switch at first contact it initiates a logic circuit on the mobo that turns the supply on </s>
<s> the supply has a built in delay of 100 to 500 ms to allow the voltage to get up to spec before it issues the power ok signal </s>
<s> the various delays would make the second contact to be missed by the logic circuitry unless it was a few seconds later </s>
<s> the problem that you had with the prior computer was likely with an at type system where the power switch was an alternate action switch and could be activated off and on rapidly this still should not bother a good supply back in the old vacuum tube days it definitely caused problems </s>
<s> well i have a very bad power supply i don t even know what brand it is i did take a look it saids quot addw power supply quot that s it i think the addw is the brand name for it like i said i builted my pc in hong kong i got it custom builted so i have no clue what kind of psu those guys gave me so far there has been some problems with it but not too serious i guess </s>
<s> a few months ago there was a very serious problem with my new pc when i click on quot log out quot in windows xp my pc unexpectly shuts off then back on then off then on then off then on rapidly and uncontrollable i pull the plug and turn my pc back on it was dead it beeps at me but nothing came on in that moment my pc was dead </s>
<s> when my hp died it too beep at me and nothing came on i cried and cried because i can t believe within just a month of losing old hp i broke another new pc i couldn t stop crying as i manually turn my pc on and off hoping it might it might come back online but it didn t so i turn it off and spend an hour crying </s>
<s> when i m finish with that i tried one more time i turn on my supposedly broken pc and a miracle happened </s>
<s> my pc was alive again </s>
<s> bios boot then windows everything was back to normal again it was strange since my pc was suppose to be broken i heard the beeps and saw the blank screen it was dead but for some odd reason it was back alive again after i turn it back on </s>
<s> maybe asus mobo revive itself but it doesn t matter my pc is working i bought my old hp in canada 5 years ago and it broke 8 times within a year and the tech guys couldn t fix it so they have to gave me new parts everytime it broke </s>
<s> every single pc i own always breaks no matter how careful i am it still breaks in the end i vow not to let my new pc breaks again that s whay i got so anxious and ask so many questions and got so worried believe me if your old pc breaks 8 times per year and your new one is having problems anyone would get all worried sick </s>
<s> well thanks for helping me out really many thanks </s>
<s> having a cheap system only provides ease in its failure sooner or later </s>
<s> but since you already experienced a 2nd pc to die maybe you got quot bad power quot like in ac </s>
<s> i suggest if you don t already get a decent surge protector a ac line conditioner plus a ups unit </s>
<s> getting all these will help or provide a level of performance just to be stable at least from ac surges and the like clean power </s>
<s> rememeber cheap is cheap and as you mentioned unit was from that source of known cheap stuff well you get the picture </s>
<s> replace the psu with a namebrand one and of at least 400w or better </s>
<s> a cheap 500w is good if its way above your power needs heck 550w psu units are becoming common </s>
<s> as for the case on switch if its truly touchy it maybe crappy construction or even broke </s>
<s> find its connection on the mtrbd </s>
<s> and unplug then replace with a simple monentarily contact sw and see if the problem goes away </s>
<s> nother one from a broke system case test unit will do fine </s>
<s> try that and get back with results tada willy </s>
<s> img img so it my pc ok </s>
<s> or te damage is already taking its toll </s>
<s> this morning it happened again i got so nervous when i was about to push that sensitive power button my hands shake when touched it and well my pc turns back on with a very strange noise coming from the chasis i think i just damage something it s all my fault t_t </s>
