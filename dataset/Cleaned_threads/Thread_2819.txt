<s> i have windows xp </s>
<s> i have fdisk d the hard drive and reinstalled windows xp and at some random point after xp is installed </s>
<s> i start getting errors on boot up and some programs won t open </s>
<s> i believe it is a bad sector on the harddrive but not sure how to fix it with xp </s>
<s> it could also be bad ram </s>
<s> i might have an old memory stick to swap out and try </s>
<s> the processor is an intel p4 3 2ghz preston chip if that matters </s>
<s> your hard drive manufacturer should have a diagnostic utility that will test the drive for possible damage </s>
<s> these are usually non destructive processes </s>
<s> often hd manufacturer s use these to validate warranty claims by having the user run the utility which returns a code describing the health of the drive </s>
<s> download and run the utility </s>
<s> as for ram free diagnostics are also available </s>
<s> use google to look up memtest or memory testers </s>
<s> there are a couple of good ones that will create a boot floppy or an iso that can be burned to a cd rom disk </s>
<s> they work well </s>
<s> if your problem is memory or the hd these free utilities will let you know </s>
<s> should have reported bad sectors and locked them out as part of the full format </s>
<s> analyze the disk using disk management and see if it reports a bad sector or locked sectors </s>
<s> you can as you stated swap out memory modules to test those besides memtest but still a good idea </s>
<s> running disk diagnostics is limited if it not allowed to actually write to all sectors such as to your disk </s>
<s> if in doubt get a new drive copy everything over ghost or new drives utilities reformat the old one and use it for backup unless its bad </s>
<s> once a sector goes more are soon to follow bite the bullet and just get a new one and transfer the data </s>
<s> here is a link to spinrite a gibson research hdd maintenance repair software program the downloadable program needs to boot your system from a floppy or cd </s>
<s> if you don t have a floppy drive you ll need burning software that can create a bootable iso image cd </s>
<s> spinrite analyzes your hdd or even floppies sector by sector removing and recovering data from a bad sector to a good one and quarantines the bad sector from future use </s>
<s> spinrite will also warn you of a failing hdd hopefully in plenty of time to either save your data or clone your hdd to a new drive </s>
<s> it will also work on tivo hard drives although you have to connect the hdd the drive from the tivo to your computer </s>
<s> the only downside is the price </s>
<s> 89 for the download but when compared to the cost downtime and inconvenience of dealing with a failed hard drive it s cheap </s>
<s> if you need to clone your hdd to a new drive i recommend acronis </s>
<s> they have a free trial period so you could probably do a quick hit run to check it out </s>
<s> oops forgot to mention that if you have a seagate or maxtor hard drive the acronis quot migrate easy quot cloning program from acronis true image is available free from seagate s download website see the quot data migration quot heading to download diskwizard for seagate drives or maxblast for maxtor drives </s>
<s> note to old timers this is not the old maxtor data transfer program for a new hdd that never worked right </s>
<s> it is actually acronis migrate easy </s>
<s> i expect the answer to this is going to be quot because there are better alternatives quot </s>
<s> i run an error check on my hard drive virtually every week </s>
<s> it s supposed to look for and fix bad sectors and file system errors </s>
<s> i once had a word document go bad on me and lost an entire edition of a magazine that i had stored to floppy </s>
<s> this utility also works on floppies so i had a chance to see it in action </s>
<s> it restored my damaged file even though it put in some squiggly marks to indicate unrestorable damage </s>
<s> i got that edition back though essentially intact </s>
<s> as a complete novice i assumed hopefully that the same utility would also do a similar repair if i got a bad sector on my hard drive </s>
<s> in case i didn t use the correct name i m talking about the checking utility that you get by clicking quot my computer quot then right clicking on quot c quot drive or whichever drive you want to check click properties select quot tools quot tab and then click quot check now quot for error checking </s>
<s> then check the two boxes restart the pc and wait while the drive is checked </s>
<s> then run a disk clean up to get rid of any check disk fragments </s>
<s> so i expect you techie people will now tell me why this isn t the best way to fix things </s>
<s> mostly i get told that microsoft utilities aren t as good as xyz alternatives </s>
<s> my laptop is getting on a bit and so i might need this information myself one day </s>
<s> sometimes you have to keep it simple on things like this </s>
<s> do what is the more likely and progress from there </s>
<s> microsoft had an update recently that broke a lot of drivers and i had to restore to fix the problem </s>
<s> sometimes you can boot up but have errors like yours </s>
<s> however in my experience i have seen these things happen in this order of likelyhood 1 sometimes a simple scan disk with both repair options checked can fix the problem followed by defragmentation </s>
<s> 2 malware recently infected can be the problem but others here have already covered this </s>
<s> 3 i already assume you didn t replace any hardware but microsoft and driver updates can cause problems with the boot process </s>
<s> a quick check of the device manager for quot splats quot on your hardware is well worth looking at </s>
<s> if there are any yellow </s>
<s> signs then it is time to have it scan for hardware changes update the driver or reinstall the driver </s>
<s> if this doesn t work go to the vendor for that device and download updates </s>
<s> make sure xp is fully updated before doing this </s>
<s> 4 now it is time to try the most likely reason your having problems but this will take more effort and so i list it last </s>
<s> some hard disks need to be low level formated with their in house disk utility before the operating system is installed if you don t do this from the get go the disk geometry can be off set and can cause serious problems later including loss of all data </s>
<s> the advise to use the original manufacturers diagnostic utility is a good one but remember if you don t find anything physically wrong with the hard disk you may have to start over and format the hard drive with the manufacturers utility </s>
<s> usually this is on the same disk as the diagnostic utility </s>
<s> all major manufacturers usually have a floppy or cd maker download so you can make the disk s yourself </s>
<s> i have had better luck with the ones that burn a cd rom as a more complete formating of the mbr area is done more easily that way </s>
<s> 5 there are many ram test utilities that can check your ram modules </s>
<s> the vendor there again is the best source but i have had great luck just using the top rated utilities here on cnet at download com </s>
<s> this is also well worth the time compared to messing inside your system units </s>
<s> the ram test discovered a problem </s>
<s> i replaced the memory and so far so good </s>
<s> i ve been able to get past the place that i would most often error </s>
<s> so i think its fixed </s>
<s> thanks for all the great troubleshooting advice </s>
<s> i will hopefully retain some of that if i have future hardware problems </s>
<s> nt </s>
