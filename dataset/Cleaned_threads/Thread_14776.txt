<s> have a belkin play n600 router with tomato v 1 28 on it </s>
<s> both the 2 4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when i use them and then completely disable completely both bands disable at same time even when i m using just one </s>
<s> to get back online i have to either turn on off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato gui </s>
<s> what s going on </s>
<s> try going back to stock then see if the issue is still there </s>
<s> many of the other images overclock the cpu or just have a bug </s>
<s> when the office see any of those custom images we swap in a stock router </s>

<s> i m afraid i m not computer smart enough to understand a word you just said </s>
<s> you re saying reinstall the belkin router s original firmware instead of tomato </s>
<s> what s quot other images quot </s>
<s> folk that install that these are called images roms flash and such usually are experts at such a thing </s>
<s> as it stands you have a router that no one could support </s>
<s> and yes that s what i said </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes i didn t install the tomato software onto the router </s>
<s> i got the router from someone else </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i ll install the belkin firmware back onto it </s>
<s> it worked </s>
<s> things are much better now </s>
<s> though sucks i can t get any ddns services except one that costs money now </s>
<s> may have to give this router to someone else and get a new one </s>
<s> that the router hardware is in good to fair shape </s>
<s> long ago ddns was not done on a router so i m left to guess you wanted it on the router </s>
<s> but fast forward to today i no longer need ddns as i solved my need in new ways </s>
