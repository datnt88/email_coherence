<s> fellow members i recently installed a new hard drive </s>
<s> in my efforts to get the thing working i must have changed some setting in bios which i had to fool with because now the system is doing a tedious ram check routine on the black screen with each boot </s>
<s> it takes a couple of precious minutes to count up to 512 fyi it is ami bios </s>
<s> i cannot discover any changes to make in bios setup to disable it </s>
<s> 2 the setup shows the smart drive feature is disabled </s>
<s> i would like it running </s>
<s> also post the mobo type to give a clue lots of ami bios </s>
<s> check the mobo manual which usually describes which bios features are in your bios and what they do </s>
<s> make sure that in adding the drive you did not unseat the memory or that you have not created a heat situation </s>
<s> it also sounds as if you may have added a bios add on with the drive </s>
<s> knowing your o s will also give a better clue </s>
<s> you need to enable quick post power on self test </s>
<s> i think it s in advanced bios setup </s>
<s> may depend on your bios version </s>
<s> os doesn t matter </s>
<s> save and exit </s>
<s> thanks for the info </s>
<s> it has stopped doing that foolishness </s>
<s> anyway it was saying quot testing nv ram quot which means non volatile ram which makes no sense </s>
