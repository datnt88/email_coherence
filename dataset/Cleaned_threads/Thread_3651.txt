<s> i hav a home pc in which i wanna install a speaker system os windows xp speaker tech com speaker code ssd 802 please help me thanx in advance </s>
<s> hopefully you realize the power output advertised on these is bogus </s>
<s> you get 10 w rms and not 800 to 900 watts the various dealers specify </s>
<s> anyway you generally just need a shielded cable that plugs into your sound card s jack and into the speaker s input jack </s>
<s> the speaker set should probably come with such a cable </s>
<s> there are no drivers or such needed </s>
<s> just plug it in turn up the volume and hope it works </s>
<s> an error occurs when i play my music it says quot windows media player cannot play the file because there is a problem with your sound device </s>
<s> there may not be a sound device installed on your computer it may be in use by another program or it may not be functioning properly quot please help n thanx to u that u r helping me </s>
<s> you either have a defective disabled or a device without drivers installed </s>
<s> you can check the sound device status under device manager right click on my computer go to properties and then hardware device manager </s>
<s> you should see a listing for sound and gaming devices </s>
<s> a yellow exclamation point usually means no driver a red x means disabled and no listing means no sound device </s>
<s> if your rca jack is along the motherboard card edge you have an on board device </s>
<s> it may be that it s not enabled in the bios </s>
<s> do a good search for a sound device on your system as a first step </s>
<s> i ll try this out at once i hope it works thanx again </s>
