<s> hi i recently dug out my old pc because i wanted to see if i could use it for a home network but i realised that it probably not good enough for gaming and stuff like that and the cmos battery shoulder holder is broke and wont hold it and the socket which i plug the monitor cable in is on its way out </s>
<s> so i was wondering whether i could just get a better motherboard and cpu and a bigger hdd too and just use the rest of the stuff thats already there </s>
<s> and is this really worth doing or expensive because i havnt got loads of money to upgrade it with at the mo </s>
<s> i ve already bought a slight ram upgrade from 64mb sdram to 2 x 128mb i know this still probably isnt enough </s>
<s> im not sure hoe to find out the type of motherboard i have or cpu </s>
<s> can anyone tell me how </s>
<s> i ve got it sitting here all open next to me so i can have a look if i need to </s>
<s> i dont know all the specs but it runs xp home and its got a 40 gb hdd </s>
<s> its a dell optiplex do you need to know the exact model </s>
<s> its one of them old flat desktop ones </s>
<s> if anyone could help me out that would be great thanx </s>
<s> dan </s>
<s> to tell </s>
<s> it should be on the tower on the front </s>
<s> if not down load this software and post your specifications here </s>
<s> i d suggest a combo combination purchase like this if it s worth upgrading have you upgraded a pc before </s>
<s> if not you might just replace it with a low end pc for a few hundred dollars </s>
<s> this is no dream machine </s>
<s> read the specification carefully </s>
<s> im from the uk so i ll have to buy one over here </s>
<s> i ve changed parts between pc s before but never really upgraded one so i ve decided its probably best just to buy a low range one then go from there </s>
<s> thanx for your advice tho it was very helpful </s>
<s> there s more to this then one might think </s>
<s> doing it is fairly easy </s>
<s> the work that is but the compatibilities can be a bit of a sticky wicket </s>
<s> let me be blunt </s>
<s> today s motherboards have too many changes from what was in there </s>
<s> don t do it </s>
<s> why should i list the parts you ll save </s>
<s> but in short let s skip to what is the best update to get some gaming out of that box </s>
<s> i suggest you look at this list gt for your agp slot then check the power supply rating and call it quits </s>
<s> the headaches of saving what may be the case the cd dvd drive and nothing else is usually not worth it </s>
<s> even the os may fail to relocate and many don t plan on that </s>
<s> it s seen better days i think </s>
<s> i thought i would just check and see whether it would have been worth doing something with it before i got rid of it </s>
<s> someone gave it to me a while ago but i never realised it was so old </s>
<s> theres a lot to learn about pc s for me </s>
<s> i thinking of maybe buying seperate parts and over time and making a newer one or if i can just get a low range and build on that </s>
<s> i ve got another pc which is is high spec so im not desperate for another one anyway </s>
<s> thanx for your advice its very helpfull </s>
<s> it s not bad to save and upgrade an old case </s>
<s> what you save is the case and its fans the power supply if it s adequate your optical drives and little things like card readers or what have you </s>
<s> you also save the landfill from a pile of toxic junk </s>
<s> often times the only thing really worn out on an old computer is just that it can t keep up with the demands of today s programs </s>
<s> a new mobo that supports modern cpus and ddr2 ram could be done reasonably nicely for under 400 for it all </s>
<s> it s definitely easier to toss and buy new but since time isn t an issue here </s>
<s> pcs contain to two primary contaminates lead from solder and flame retardants </s>
<s> many of the flame retardants are naturally curring substances that are non toxic </s>
<s> lead is a heavy metal and because of it s weight it may not travel far from the landfill </s>
<s> this of course varies from pc too pc and the materials used so there might be some pcs safer then others </s>
