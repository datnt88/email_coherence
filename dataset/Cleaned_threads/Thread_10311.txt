<s> i have an airtel broadband connection in my 2 storey house </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but it is at ground floor i can run only 1 pc at a time </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so i wanted to intall a wireless connection over now cos of laptop but i wanted it to be spread throughout the house </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> intalling one router will cause problems due to concrete walls </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> therefore i was considering if their was any way i could install a router on each floor so that their is no problem in future </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> now i wanted to know whether it is possible through one connection </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if yes then how </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if you have a better way plzz kindly let me know </s>
<s> while i didn t have any issue with our 2 storey let s go with the story you could not get wifi to the second floor </s>
<s> how i solve that is with 2 more things </s>
<s> 1 an ac powerline bridge see amazon and google 2 a second router but configured as a wap </s>
<s> see google for how to do that </s>
<s> this is just above beginner networking so you must be comfortable with this and researching it on google or have it done for you </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> which router did you use for your 2 storey home </s>
