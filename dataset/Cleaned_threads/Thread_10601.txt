<s> i have a gateway sx2802 03 with a nvidia gt610 installed </s>
<s> the psu is 220w but the graphics card says it needs a minimum of 300w </s>
<s> ive been using it for a few months now with the 220w </s>
<s> i wanted to know if running it underpower was alright and if i upgraded the psu to a 400w or so if that would improve my gpu preformance </s>
<s> here is a link to the psu from what i found </s>
<s> example at but the answer is no </s>
<s> changing the power supply will not improve the gpu </s>
<s> just wondering why not the slightly better gpu i recommend for such machines </s>
<s> that s the ati 5450 1gb card </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> unfortunately i didn t purchase it it was a gift </s>
<s> but hey it was free </s>
<s> anyways i would have probably gone with a better upgrade if i bought it myself </s>
<s> the manufacturer has mentioned to use quot x wattage quot they know what they re doing </s>
<s> they have superior knowledge and pass it on </s>
<s> even though it works for now sooner or later it will bite you </s>
<s> should the psu fail you will have problems so best to follow what s recommended </s>
<s> recommended psu is best for continued operation of the pc </s>
<s> no it won t make the pc run better but it will run which is the point for the recommendation for gpu operation </s>
<s> more demanding gpu tend to tax the psu once its gets into more extreme setting or prolonged usage </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
