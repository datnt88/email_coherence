<s> it didn t come with any standoffs </s>
<s> my old pc case standoffs raise the motherboard too high to fit correctly </s>
<s> the new case has the screw holes raised away from the case </s>
<s> does this mean i do not need standoffs </s>
<s> if you need to see a pic to be sure let me know </s>
<s> new case old case </s>
<s> yes i would think that is true </s>
<s> but just double check to be sure none of them touch the board where they shouldn t </s>
<s> if so happen that it does touch then i probably use electrical tape or plastic washer to insulated it </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> the case appears to offer metal standoffs as part of its make up </s>
<s> these are screw down hold it place areas posts </s>
<s> but if this doesn t match what is required for the mtrbd </s>
<s> as in the mounting areas are off though these standoffs are there only to prevent moving of the mtrbd </s>
<s> and proper grounding </s>
<s> if other stand offs are required then the h w is either missing or wasn t include </s>
<s> there is nothing to keep you from returning the case as its incomplete </s>
<s> usually some plastic stand offs are needed to keep the mtrbd </s>
<s> flexing to touch the metal casing </s>
<s> though when short of some items like this or seemingly lacking a good fit or match i use foam to help separate metal and mtrbd you have to use your judgment of this as the picture while helpful isn t showing just how the mtrbd </s>
<s> would fit </s>
<s> a local source of a computer should have h w kits or spare posts to buy </s>
<s> also online vendors offer such items google for them if you want to keep the case and standoffs are needed for best install </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
