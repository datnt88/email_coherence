<s> i saved the nero logs from two seperate burns and they are different although they have the same characteristics burns about 4 4gb then stops and a error message comes up </s>
<s> in one of the logs it says 17 12 16 nerovision </s>
<s> 05 12 08 </s>
<s> i have read something about nero having problems with the ac3 audio format how do i find out if my file is using that format </s>
<s> and if it is how to i recode it </s>
<s> i am sure ac3 audio format is not the problem now </s>
<s> turns out the audio was in mp3 format </s>
<s> i tried to burn the same thing on my benq 1620 worked perfectly </s>
