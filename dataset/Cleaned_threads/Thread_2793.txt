<s> i need a desk top but i need no bells and whistles </s>
<s> speed is not terribly important nor is memory </s>
<s> 100g hd and a dozen or so ram is all i ll need </s>
<s> i do not game nor will i ever </s>
<s> i need xp office and powerpoint </s>
<s> other than that only a 17 flat screen monitor and a cd burner completes my package </s>
<s> i don t need any technical support either </s>
<s> i really don t need a warranty </s>
<s> i ve used a presario 700 laptop for the last four years and had no problems </s>
<s> thus should i purchase a new budget desktop or go to ebay and buy the separate components </s>
<s> tnanks in advance cavaleer </s>
<s> here s one for 750 with dual core cpu that meets your specs it s pretty hard to build your own cheaper than the 400 specials </s>
<s> the windows os is 100 so 300 barely covers the hardware </s>
<s> if you re going to build your own definitely go to newegg com zipzoomfly com tigerdirect com etc </s>
<s> i buy from ebay frequently but no ebay seller can beat the prices of the websites i mentioned for the same new hardware </s>
<s> here s a 470 including shipping configuration asus barebones case power supply mobo 135 amd athlon x2 4200 cpu 75 wd 200gb sata drive 75 corsair 1gb ddr2 667 39 sony nec 18x dvd burner 30 logitech keyboard optical mouse 15 windows vista premium 99 17 quot lcds are the same price as 19 quot lcds now </s>
<s> monitors always on sale somewhere so just wait a week or two until you see one for less than 160 </s>
<s> otherwise here s a couple of choices asus 19 quot widescreen 190 before 30 rebate hanns g 19 quot widescreen 173 acer 17 quot 180 acer 19 quot 180 </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
<s> i don t want to spend more than 700 </s>
<s> this will be a true utility appliance compared to what others are doing with their computers </s>
<s> the laptop question is a good one </s>
<s> on one hand i don t want to spend 2000 on a laptop when i could buy the same tools for 500 700 i have other places i d like to spend that money since my computer truly will be an appliance </s>
<s> on the other hand i will be traveling a great deal in the coming months and i can see the eventual superiority of a laptop </s>
<s> for the moment however a desktop will take care of my immediate needs and when if i see the real need for a laptop i ll buy one </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> i just browsed circuit city and i can find something perfect for me for more or less the same price as the separate components </s>
<s> i ll check best buy for comparison sake </s>
<s> i can drive to both locations as well </s>
<s> many thanks again cavaleer </s>
