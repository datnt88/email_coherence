<s> i need a driver for the ricoh rw5125a to work on a windows 98 i can give you the specs if need be any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> today no driver is required for it to function as a cd or dvd quot drive quot however software to record or play a dvd might be needed </s>
<s> some refer to such as drivers but they are not drivers </s>

<s> i didn t even try the drive as a dvd drive yet i didnt try to play a dvd but i dont have software anyway </s>
<s> my computer labels it as a cd rom i ll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works </s>
<s> though somebody gave me this site i don t know what to get from it </s>
<s> subtract that comma at the end and the link will work </s>
<s> that s fine and how i see many working drives </s>
<s> quot my computer labels it as a cd rom i ll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works </s>
<s> though somebody gave me this site quot i don t see how that applies </s>
<s> if you want to play a dvd you ll need dvd player software such as windvd powerdvd </s>
