<s> i m considering purchasing a new desktop pc to replace my 7 year old pc </s>
<s> i spoke to a sales rep with one of the major pc manufacturers last night and the question came to security software antivirus software and etc </s>
<s> i told him i definitely planned to have installed something like norton s anti virus software </s>
<s> i also told him i d be switching from a basic dial up internet connection to a high speed internet connection such as dsl or cable modem </s>
<s> besides making sure that i have an anti virus software program installed on my new pc before connecting it to the internet for the first time what other types of software for computer security should i also have installed on my new desktop pc before i connect it to the internet for the very first time </s>
<s> i intend to use my new desktop computer for basic home office use email web surfing personal finance and word processing </s>
<s> i m in the 50 year old category i don t play games nor do i make videos on a pc </s>
<s> based upon my use of a home desktop pc should i have installed any other security software on my new pc before i connect it to the internet for the very first time </s>
<s> comments from anyone in this forum who happen to know would certainly be appreciated </s>

<s> you definetly need protection when using any quot always on quot isp service </s>
<s> no matter how you look at it you simply can t go forth until protected </s>
<s> you need the av pgm </s>
<s> such as norton s plus any firewall pgm </s>
<s> norton s has it own firewall but another maker zonealarm is very popular black ice and sysgate s are also </s>
<s> the other part is having a good spyware scanner too two are free and darn good they are spybot v 1 3 and ad aware se </s>
<s> webroot s spyware scanner is popalur too but is a commerical one </s>
<s> your new isp cable or dsl may provide some of the protection pgms </s>
<s> for you to use so ask or read the fine print </s>
<s> you may also get such s w with your new system either as demoware or trialware to see it work in either case you just got to have it installed </s>
<s> once you install the s w any brand make sure to quot update it quot immediately to have full 100 protection from the git </s>
<s> enjoy willy </s>
<s> yes all of the above </s>
<s> you could also get dsl cable router to hook between your dsl cable modem and you pc </s>
