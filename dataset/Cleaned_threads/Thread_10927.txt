<s> okay i have an older motherboard m5saa it has a socket 7 interface </s>
<s> i know i know they are ancient and stuff but i refurbish older computer parts and make cheap computers that people can use such as me and my brother and sister </s>
<s> anyway the motherboard wont respond to any differences in core voltage bus speed or multiplier </s>
<s> i have also tried different processors </s>
<s> so it will turn on but no response from the monitor or hd or floppy </s>
<s> is there a way to fix this problem </s>
<s> hi </s>
<s> any beeps from the speaker or signal from the keyboard </s>
<s> to check the board if it s good turn it on and see if the num lock keylock and scroll lock lights up </s>
<s> also listen for beeps from the speakers </s>
<s> and does the power supply match the type </s>
<s> need a better explanation as to what you mean by quot no response from the hd or floppy quot </s>
<s> without video on the monitor it sure is tough to troubleshoot because getting into the bios can be so useful </s>
<s> nevermind i know that i havent responded in a while so dont worry about im going to just throw the motherboard away thanks anyway </s>
