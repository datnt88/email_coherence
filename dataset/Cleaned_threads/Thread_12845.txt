<s> hey i know this has probably been covered before but i couldn t find one that matched my situation </s>
<s> ok so i bought a sata hd as a backup dive and at first xp recognized it </s>
<s> but i got an error half way though formatting the sata and since then xp will not recognized it and don t say disk management because that the typical solution i keep finding except for the fact that it doesn t show in disk management </s>
<s> any idea s people </s>
<s> system is amd athlon 3200 64 bit msi rs482m4 mother board 1 5 gigs of ram with a ide main hd and the sata is a wd caviar black </s>
<s> try that if not then maybe go to wd website and download some </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i guess you didn t read the part that the hd doesn t show in disk management </s>
<s> it shows in the bios not in windows </s>
<s> and i ve tried all of the software to download from wd and still nothing </s>
<s> it may be worth deleting your sata controller driver from device manager </s>
<s> after removing it and rebooting the system will automatically reinstall and redetect devices attached </s>
<s> if it still fails preform the same again with the sata drive detached and after it s reinstalled then attach the sata drive </s>
