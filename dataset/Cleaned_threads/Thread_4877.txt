<s> i just bought an hp f1905b along with their hp media center bundle and this is a great display </s>
<s> the fonts and images are very crisp and the colors are vibrant </s>
<s> it is by far one of the best image quality i have seen on the market so far </s>
<s> great buy for those who are looking for a 19 inch display </s>
<s> i recommend it </s>
<s> i recently bought an hp media center pc that comes bundled with the f2105 21 quot lcd monitor </s>
<s> it is fantastic </s>
<s> in addition to being a pc monitor it is also hdtv ready </s>
<s> i got a comcast hd cable box and hooked it up to the monitor </s>
<s> fantastic </s>
<s> i think i spend more time watching hdtv then working on the pc </s>
<s> the only problem i find with this monitor is that it doesn t have any vidio inputs s video component video for connecting a dvd player or other components </s>
<s> otherwise i highly recommend this monitor </s>
<s> i have had the 1905 for 4 months wait til you play a game like doom 3 wife loves the digital pics we take on it </s>
<s> this is a great monitor however if you live in the states you should be prepared to spend about 1500 00 to get one because you must buy it as part of a computer package </s>
<s> i approached hp about buying one and was told that they could not help me </s>
<s> it seems strange for them to be so unhelpful but nobody and i talked to at least 6 people could tell me where to buy one of these </s>
<s> it is available as a stand alone product in canada i was just about to give up when i found one on ebay </s>
<s> i love it and would by a couple more if they were available here </s>
<s> in my area this monitor is available at almost every single one of my electronic retail stores best buy circuit city office depot compusa microcenter </s>
<s> the cheapest price ive seen it is 641 99 on amazon </s>
<s> i dont know what you are talking about </s>
<s> i got mine around 3 weeks ago at circuit city for 380 00 after 50 00 rebate and they still have that price and yes the monitor great </s>
<s> well i bought 2x of these hp f1905b </s>
<s> overall they are not bad of a monitors </s>
<s> the first thing i noticed is that they are ultra bright meaning they hurt my eyes </s>
<s> when you remov a bit of contrast and brightness the image becomes dull and lifeless </s>
<s> the optimal settings seem to be the factory ones </s>
<s> the second thing is that one of them came with a dead pixel </s>
<s> the third i think these panels are 6bits instead of being 8bits so the color reproduction isn t that great </s>
<s> you can see color interpolation being done to your images </s>
<s> the fourth is that it is not true that it has an anti reflective surface quite the opposite </s>
<s> it is very reflective to the point of being distracting </s>
<s> anywas i personaly would give it a 7 10 </s>
<s> it is good if the only thing you do is office work </s>
<s> your first 2 points are flawed </s>
<s> first off all monitors are set to be super high brightness because they are in displays at stores that use lots of strong fluorescent lights </s>
<s> so to make it stand out they are factory set the highest brightness </s>
<s> and turning any monitors brightness and contrast down makes the image look dull </s>
<s> thats the definition of a dull image low contrast and brightness </s>
<s> second the 1 dead pixel thing is expected </s>
<s> if you have less than 3 dead pixels its not worth ranting about </s>
<s> its not covered on either dells or hps guarentee </s>
<s> and is expected </s>
<s> i honestly expect to have 2 dead pixels when i buy an lcd any more and i would try to do something about it especially if they are in a cluster if they dont have any dead pixels great but thats the norm 2 dead pix on a 19 quot display </s>
<s> as for your last two points i dont know if its 6bit reporduction but couldnt find anything to hint that </s>
<s> but yes your final point the monitor is extremely reflective no argument </s>
<s> use it in a room where the lighting isnt behind it best you can do </s>
<s> nevertheless this is one of the best 19 quot out there </s>
<s> xeno tell me something did you lower the brightness down and the contrast </s>
<s> what are your settings </s>
<s> i also noticed then when the screen is set to 100 black there is some light bleeding from the background around the edges do you have the same problem too </s>
<s> what about video playback </s>
<s> on mine when i played my seinfeld dvd it looked all grainy </s>
<s> does your do the same thing as well </s>
<s> now don t get me wrong i really find this monitor way above average but this is my first lcd so that is i am being a bit more critical about it </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> i opened my second box of the second hp1905b and yet to discover again another quality issue </s>
<s> there is a large of what seems to be a dust particle stuck behind the lcd membrane and it is in the middle of the screen </s>
<s> baiscally whenever there is white you see a gray dot of dust that cannot be removed </s>
<s> needless to say the two monitors i have are returning to the store </s>
<s> i will get two hp f1905b though just to give them a last chance </s>
<s> i like the clarity of the image and it is a shame that i had qa issues 2 2 </s>
<s> i will keep you posted </s>
<s> k here goes i ll try to answer all of those </s>
<s> brightness contrast i didnt change at all </s>
<s> i have my computer in an extremely bright room </s>
<s> and i like brightscreens p as for the screen being slightly bright when brightness is set down to 0 that is because of the lcds backlight </s>
<s> all lcds have total black issues and are noticable when gaming in dark maps thats where plasmas have the upper hand </s>
<s> but that isnt an option really for a pc monitor video playback shouldnt be grainy </s>
<s> i havent noticed that could it be the quality of the video source </s>
<s> if not then your screen has issues </s>
<s> one more thing though you might want to check is that you are running at native resolution </s>
<s> thats 1280 1024 for the f1905 </s>
<s> due to the nature of lcds they have seperate pixels that dont scale when you change the resolution simply the image or video feed is scaled to that resolution </s>
<s> so lets say you are running 1600 1200 on it you will have blurry pixels and such due to that resolution being scaled down to 1280 1024 also if you found a peice of dust between the membrane and the backlight that means your screen was a bad build for sure return it </s>
<s> i hope you dont run into anything thats unexpected with your new monitor </s>
