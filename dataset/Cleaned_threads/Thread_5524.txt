<s> some pc specs are asus k8v mx motherboard 1gb ram amd athlon xp 2500 cpu 80 gb hd </s>
<s> i ve tried using the zen on a new notebook i bought and it works fine on it </s>
<s> unfortunately all my music files are on my pc </s>
<s> any help or suggestions would be great </s>

<s> save me another repeat and go get your motherboard drivers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> motherboard chipset driver version is 4 46 </s>
<s> i guess we can discuss this at length </s>
<s> what do you need to know to go get the latest drivers </s>
<s> it s a very common issue which i solve daily by installing such </s>
<s> i find many want to discuss why this happens </s>
<s> sorry but i d rather just fix it and move on </s>
<s> if the latest doesn t fix it then we drill down to less common issues </s>
<s> your choice here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i downloaded and installed the via hyperion pro driver package version 5 10a </s>
<s> rebooted the pc after installation plugged in the creative zen to the usb and the pc still powers down after docking </s>
<s> if it powers down tell me what wattage rating you had in the power supply </s>
<s> you are not alone if it s just the front ports </s>
<s> see bob </s>
<s> the power supply is 300 watts </s>
<s> the case only has rear usb ports </s>
<s> the usb cable i am using i also use for an mp3 player and digital camera without issues </s>
<s> while i wouldn t expect an usb device to push it over the edge that s mightly slim </s>
<s> what happens if you use a powered usb hub </s>
<s> and i did run into an issue with my palmone tx </s>
<s> it would garble data when i used an extension cable and cause problems </s>
<s> connect it directly to the usb port without a cable or only the cable supplied with the player </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i bought a powered usb hub and it did the trick </s>
<s> it works great now </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>

<s> mother board version is rev 1 xx </s>
