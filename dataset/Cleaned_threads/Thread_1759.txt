<s> hi all after a little help here i have a msi k9n2gm motherboard one day while turning the system on via the power unit power switch at rear it crackled and then the system wouldn t turn on </s>
<s> the light on the power unit wouldn t illuminate and the fans failed to start </s>
<s> as such i was unable to test any of the systems </s>
<s> note that the power unit was checked and confirmed faulty however when i connected the new one up there was no power light on the board </s>
<s> power unit was good quality oz one with several safeguards so im unsure where to go from here any ideas what to try next </s>
<s> im hoping the 9850 phenom quadcore black edition 2 x 2gb 800mhz ddr2 ram are still alive </s>
<s> its important the replacement psu is as capable as old one was or even better wattage wise </s>
<s> of course all connections must be done and in proper place </s>
<s> if this has been done and it still refuses to work you have a secondary problem </s>
<s> when the psu failed it may have taken down another device component and refuses to boot or power on </s>
<s> if hd or cd dreive etc replace and hope it continues to work </s>
<s> however if the mtrbd </s>
<s> is zapped then consider another to replace it </s>
<s> in most cases fixing the mtrbd </s>
<s> won t be practical or becomes troublesome as time goes on of course this depends on your repair abilities </s>
<s> if so eliminate any device compotent before installing on new mtrbd tada willy </s>
<s> thanks for the info there im just wondering if it will have damaged the cpu or ram </s>
<s> replacing the mb aint to much of a problem just worried about buying a new baord then having to do the cpu and possibly ram </s>
<s> remove everything on the mtrbd </s>
<s> leave only the spkr </s>
<s> attached </s>
<s> and assure the psu is connected </s>
<s> power on it should beep away in some form or fashion </s>
<s> if it doesn t then the mtrbd </s>
<s> is truly gone </s>
<s> if it does beep then return the cpu and hsf remount and test it should still beep but in some pattern </s>
<s> connect video and so on one item at a time and test each time for results and the beep pattern </s>
<s> the bios beep code will determine if or anything is related to missing device etc but it may not and that could be the problem area </s>
<s> if possible test other devices elsewhere to verify them </s>
<s> also take the time when everything is missing to inspect closely the mtrbd </s>
<s> for blown bulging etc </s>
<s> quot bad caps quot google for examples </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> have you checked ram </s>
<s> sometimes this problem creates because of ram </s>
