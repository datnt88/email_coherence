<s> hi i have a client who requres tablets for a number of users </s>
<s> am having problems sourcing the best tablet requirements o s windows or android as a vital app they program they use is only available on windows or android 3g capability either through direct sim or dongle as they work rurally and will not always have a wifi connection be able to print </s>
<s> we have had trouble finding a printer in nz that is cheap enough to purchase and is easily connected to by the tablets </s>
<s> seems to be a hard ask finding samsung tablets in nz at a reasonable price </s>
<s> any ideas would be really helpful </s>
<s> i haven t found connections to printers to be any harder than usual for windows 8 pro tablets than in the past </s>
<s> maybe you mean something else but i m seeing folk demand easier than the usual </s>
<s> they want no drivers it just connects and prints </s>
<s> is that what you are seeing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks yes thats not a problem with windows8 but its also finding a tablet that is 3g compatible which is causing the issue </s>
<s> any ideas on a tablet that meets all those needs </s>
<s> why is not too interesting except it gives us a better choice of carriers lower costs </s>
<s> as importing is a problem i can t share models we see in the usa </s>
<s> but it appears you have yet to find any in your market </s>
<s> doesn t that clarify that what you want is going to be something in the future </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> am going to find a forum in nz </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> you probably won t find what your looking for in a retail or online consumer outlet for a pure tablet based device </s>
<s> my advice is to check with the local nz wireless providers for a tablet based device as they will have to support the data wireless plan for windows or android and the hardware was most likely designed specifically for them </s>
<s> by comparison apple supports the ipad regardless of wireless carrier because they own the hardware and os </s>
<s> the units with cellular are rarely outside the normal carrier channels for well discussed reasons </s>
<s> i can t cover this in full detail but here we use the run of the mill tablets but a hotspot box for the reason i gave and more </s>
<s> you seemed concerned with costs so it seems you either forge an alliance with the cellular carrier or take a big risk in importing something </s>
<s> i ve seen a few try that here and they get burned later </s>
<s> but folk will continue to try it </s>
<s> bob </s>
