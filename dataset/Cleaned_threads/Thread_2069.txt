<s> i have inherited an old 500mhz machine that i am looking to turn into a media server </s>
<s> it came with a 10gb hd so for obvious reasons i m looking to increase the storage </s>
<s> i have found a 300 gb ata 133 that i am interested in but i don t know if my machine can handle it </s>
<s> are there maximums for a machine s hd size </s>
<s> also before i buy a hard drive i want to make sure it has a compatible interface </s>
<s> i know my machine works with ata drives and this drive says it uses parallel ata </s>
<s> is this the same thing </s>
<s> my machine is a hp pavillion 6630 thanks in advance </s>
<s> trish </s>
<s> they both are the same thing pata and ata </s>
<s> you should be good to go with the 300gb but to make sure what os are you using </s>
<s> and you are putting the 300gb on the ntfs file type correct </s>
<s> sometimes old os s won t allow or won t recognize the full size of the hard drive </s>
<s> ibrahim </s>
<s> not even worth to turn into a server with those low specs </s>
<s> how long would it take to upload the files 300gb could take weeks non stop </s>
<s> roger </s>
<s> i agree with roger making a media server out of that </s>
<s> go try but you won t have any fun </s>
<s> you can get a new computer or build one your own </s>
<s> those older piii systems almost always need to have an ata 100 or ata 133 hard disk controller card added to a pci slot to use drives over 137gb </s>
<s> you also need an operating system that supports large hs s </s>
<s> references </s>
<s> i would not sink much money into it </s>
<s> harddrive more memory etc you can buy a cheap computer and have a machine that will work for you a lot better </s>
<s> some media cameras mp3 players want usb 2 0 or you will need alot of patience </s>
<s> read some of your media apps requirements they also may want a bigger system </s>
<s> i have 2 desktops that are 400 mhz they are great for the kids to surf the net and play older games </s>
<s> i won t upgrade the computers </s>
<s> i bought myself a new computer and they have the older ones </s>
<s> it just not worth it to turn that old thing into a media server </s>
<s> like everyone else said slow slow and just slow </s>
<s> u could just buy an emachine desktop for 550 emachines are not bad as ppl think they are </s>
<s> they have good quality with bring cheap </s>
<s> i had a dell and then i bought another desktop e machines everything is awesome i am gamer and so i buy a lot of pc games and emachines never let me down </s>
<s> i actually got it for multimedia purposes and it has never ever let me down except for the fact that i have been having problem with burning from cd r dvd combo drive but they have a really good tech support </s>
<s> and it wasn t the computer s fault either </s>
<s> the person from the tech support said that i mus have downloaded some software and when i uninstalled it it probably deleted some of my file and the tech person gave me instructions on how to solve it too </s>
<s> also i download a lot of free software from internet especially from download com and unistall a lot of them too and the comp </s>
<s> never caused any problems in that either </s>
<s> for 550 u will probably get if u look for deal in flyers there are many every two weeks of so 1gig ddram atleast 160gig hdd microsoft media center 2005 i recommened it some good graphics card probably ati wat else do u need </s>
