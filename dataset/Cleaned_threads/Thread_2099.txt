<s> i have a basic question </s>
<s> my dell 580 has an integrated nic card </s>
<s> does this give me the capability to acces the web or do i still need a wireless card </s>
<s> did you connect to your network or lan with the usual ethernet cable </s>
<s> i have comcast quot triple play quot using an arris cable router modem </s>
<s> the arris is connected by a quot plug link quot to an electrical socket </s>
<s> two computers connect to the lan via plug links </s>
<s> my main computer is separated from the arris by about 75 feet with a lot of walls in between resulting in a very erratic internet connection </s>
<s> i just purchased a netgear range extender with the thought that i would connect wirelessly like my laptops from the arris </s>
<s> this is why i m asking if the nic is wireless capable </s>
<s> this question is really academic because the range extender doesn t seem to extend range </s>
<s> i used my laptop to test the signal and of course it connects easily within 30 50 feet of the arris </s>
<s> however the laptop doesn t appear to be getting any signal from the range extender as the signal degrades immediatly adjacent to the extender </s>
<s> my thoughts now are to purchase a second cable modem and place it close to the main computer and connect it by ethernet </s>
<s> i don t know if this will work with two modems working off the same comcast cable signal </s>
<s> i am not a quot techy quot so would appreciate any thoughts </s>
<s> my arris is not a router </s>
<s> if i connected one machine the other would not work </s>
<s> so far a nic is not wireless </s>
<s> i can however use a nic to connect wirelessly if i use an ethernet cable to what might be called a bridge </s>
<s> sorry but it looks like you are asking me to give a course in networking </s>
<s> that i will have to decline but will answer the stumpers </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks </s>
