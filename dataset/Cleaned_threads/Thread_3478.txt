<s> i just tried to connect 2 laptops windows xp with communications cables </s>
<s> each cable plugged into a usb port on the laptops </s>
<s> the cables connected to usb to serial converters </s>
<s> the computers indicated that the cables were connected to com ports </s>
<s> this setup had been working but i upgraded some software and i think that some settings got overwritten </s>
<s> i kept getting messages that the computers were not connecting </s>
<s> what should i do </s>
<s> any help would be great </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> can you share the manual or web site you used to setup connections via these serial ports </s>
<s> i didn t set it up </s>
<s> i don t know what manual or website was used </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> move to something standard </s>
<s> maybe you can tell more about why serial rs 232 usb adapters were used </s>
<s> what does this do for you </s>

<s> i think the software required it </s>
<s> the system is dedicated to this software </s>
<s> since the previous version of this software was working and the software upgrade process said nothing about changing the hardware i would like to leave the hardware in place </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> contacting the software maker or those that set this up </s>
<s> your posts do not contain details needed to begin a discussion on this </s>
<s> good luck bob </s>
