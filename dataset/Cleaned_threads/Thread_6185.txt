<s> i know there are a couple of these but i have a different angle </s>
<s> i have checked tom s website and have been watching prices for a while waiting for a quot jump in quot point </s>
<s> i mean you kind of just have to take a leap eventually right </s>
<s> theres always something bigger and better next month </s>
<s> plus i want to get one before vista becomes standard equipment </s>
<s> i don t know about the rest of you but i don t trust the new operating system to not be buggy as all hell </s>
<s> so i mostly do basic surfing but would like to do some gaming again like possibly world of warcraft call of duty flight sim x football manager used to be championship manager and probably be able to play most games for another couple years </s>
<s> so i was thinking either a x2 4200 or e6300 with 1gb and dual 7600gt cards </s>
<s> i might spend a bit more on the 6400 if i go intel but cyberpower has better deals on the athlons </s>
<s> so i was wondering if anyone out in the quot field quot has any real world experience with either of these chips and how they would perform </s>
<s> looking at a 3dmark score is great but lets be subjective for a second </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> for me i have the same situation you can check my other thread </s>
<s> my budget is probably lower than yours 750 i ve done some research on video cards and i found that one 7950gt is much better than two 7600gt s </s>
<s> it ll cost you the same amount of money to get one of those if you consider all the components you won t need like a better power supply </s>
<s> sli setup two 7600 s 1 the two 7600 s 250ish 2 power supply 20 more than a normal one for sli support around 280 one 7950gt ko superclocked 1 video card 280 around 250 basically i d go for the second option b c you d get more bang for your buck </s>
<s> here s a link to the 7950gt ko superclocked </s>
<s> the second option should have a total of 280 </s>
<s> and for the cpu s i would go with the core 2 b c of it s solid performance with better graphics cards </s>
<s> better cpu s tend to work better with th faster video cards you ll even see a 40 50 fps increase with the core 2 compared to the athlon x2 trust me </s>
