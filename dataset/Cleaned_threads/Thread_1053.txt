<s> ok first the desktop i m trying to figure out how to get a decent computer for a low price like 400 to 700 or so </s>
<s> including a monitor lcd especially if the price is toward the high end what i will be using it for is net surfing graphics editing including pics captured by my digital camera audio recording and editing at least stereo maybe sometimes 4 or more simultaneous channels from cassette cd 33rpm reel to reel etc video capture from vhs and other formats and editing games half life maybe half life 2 when it s under 20 or when team fortress 2 comes out and is down to 20 30 etc i will want to run windows xp on it and be able to simultaneously dual boot linux or a similar os </s>
<s> i already have an 80gb hard drive and a 250gb hard drive in my dad s computer </s>
<s> some specs i am thinking i might need want 1 4 to 2ghz cpu i m flexible on this if i don t need something that fast i m willing to go as low as 1 to 1 2ghz a quiet power supply ram at least 1gb </s>
<s> 2 or 4gb or even 8gb would be better </s>
<s> hard drive i already have one but an extra one equal to the total capacity of what i currently have this could be used for backups as it would take more dual layer dvd s than i want to use and my quot backups quot consist of a complete bit for bit mirror of the hard drive </s>
<s> dual layer multiformat 8x or faster dvd burner high end sound card for example creative audigy platinum with front external controls and plugins or something else that s recommended preferably with at least 4 or 8 channel or more simultaneous input capability </s>
<s> a good video card with capture or a separate capture card the monitor lcd depends on where i put my computer </s>
<s> if i integrate it into my full sized upright piano i could put a 15 quot lcd monitor in there </s>
<s> i would want to be able to run at least 1280x960 preferablly 1408x1056 or 1600x1200 or higher </s>
<s> if i put the computer somewhere else although i may have trouble finding a place for it i would want a monitor capable of at least 2048x1536 80 hz preferably as high as 2560x1920 75 hz </s>
<s> a good high speed network card multimedia internet keyboard and multi button optical wheel mouse wireless might be nice name brand is a huge plus front usb 2 0 sound etc </s>
<s> ports ok now for the notebook this one is more severely budget limited so my specs won t be as demanding max of 350 preferably 250 or lower this one i mainly would be using for transfering stuff from my mp3 player recorder and digital camera and maybe occasionally other things cpu speed probably up to 1ghz ram 256mb would probably be ok os windows 2000 although xp would be nice sound decent doesn t need to be professional quality but not a cheapie solution display at least 1280x960 preferably 1600x1200 or higher resolution hard drive either 20gb if i also get a usb 2 0 external hard drive enclosure which would be included in my budget or 40gb to 80gb if i don t get the external enclosure usb 2 0 ports 1 1 is too slow battery holds at least a 3 to 4 hour charge 2 5 under heavy use any other suggestions </s>
<s> and where should i look for something </s>
<s> i realize ebay is probably the most likely if not the only option for the notebook in which case i would insist on one with a good new battery but what should i look for </s>
<s> i could wait several months to get a computer and or notebook but i don t want to be rushed into a buying decision when the time comes </s>
<s> that s one fine computer </s>
<s> good luck finding one </s>
<s> if that s us dollars usd then we ll all want to know where these machines are at that price </s>
<s> bob </s>
