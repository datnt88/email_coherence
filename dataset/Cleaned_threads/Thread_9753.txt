<s> hi i have purchased a webcam model no quot sn9c103 quot make tevion in last year </s>
<s> this webcam was working perfectly fine with windows xp operating system loaded on my old laptop </s>
<s> i changed my laptop which has quot windows vista quot pre loaded on it </s>
<s> now i am trying to install this webcam on the new laptop and it is not getting installed </s>
<s> during installation i am getting a message quot not enough storage is available to complete this operation quot </s>
<s> can anybody help in installing this webcam </s>
<s> warm regards chandrashekhar s joshi </s>
<s> i had some trouble tracking this down </s>
<s> it is not a vista driver </s>
<s> i hope this is the brand name manufacturer for this web cam </s>
<s> of the few sites that did list some form of driver for it none said they had a driver for vista </s>
<s> seek out the manufacturer of this product and see if the driver is available from there web site </s>
<s> i had the same problem with a web cam and the simplest solution was to get a new one </s>
<s> also i have mcafee site advisor on my computer and i don t believe i ve ever seen so few sites reviewed or so many yellow warnings then i had on this search </s>
<s> where did you get that thing </s>
<s> there certainly in a bad neighborhood </s>
<s> download install this driver </s>
<s> it worked for me </s>
<s> hi cris thanks a lot for helping me out and sending the link </s>
<s> downloaded the drivers on the link given by you </s>
<s> but they do not work </s>
<s> the 1st 3rd driver on the list didn t work for me either but i tried the 31 bit one and it worked immediately </s>
<s> that other guy gave that drivers for it are available </s>
<s> the part number should be listed on the webcam or on the driver cd dvd if not check the settings program within all programs </s>
<s> some times drivers aren t created designed correctly so they don t work </s>
<s> contact this site for assistance </s>
<s> one last note try totally uninstalling the driver before you install those available from this site </s>
<s> this will provide a quot clean quot install of the driver </s>
<s> over wrighting them sometimes causes trouble </s>
<s> a question do you like the webcam when it works </s>
<s> how is the hires </s>
<s> is it really clear </s>
<s> what i did was uninstall using this driver once uninstalled reinstalled then when asked to restart do it once restarted it will ask to carry on 5 seconds later done ready to use this is the link you need </s>
<s> hi maccy thanks a lot </s>
<s> i tried the way you mentioned </s>
<s> now my webcam is working perfectly fine </s>
<s> thanks a lot for helping me out </s>
<s> warm regards chandrashekhar s joshi </s>
<s> thanks also for the info but i cant link my web cam to msn </s>
