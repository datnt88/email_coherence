<s> hey there i m hoping someone can help me out with a decision on a purchase i m making for a new system </s>
<s> where i m stuck is in deciding between a single 150gb 10 000rpm sata150 drive and 4 7200rpm sata 3gb s drives in a raid10 array </s>
<s> i know that the raid10 will give me added security due to its data redundancy but am unsure of how performance will compare to the single 10krpm drive </s>
<s> basically if i m looking at a dramatic performance hit with the raid configuration i d be willing to sacrifice security </s>
<s> fwiw i m going to be using this in a dual xeon quad core 3d graphics video editing machine </s>
<s> thanks for any and all recommendations </s>
<s> num </s>
<s> most data loss is due to user error virus or outright theft </s>
<s> how does raid any version help in light that better than 9 out of 10 times that delete key was the error </s>
<s> also since that s the common cause data recovery is nearly impossible or too costly since most getdataback tools don t work on raid </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> actually the majority say 6 or so data loss issues my company has had have been due soley to hardware error </s>
<s> several went to data recovery services who confirmed the hardware based error base while several just ended up on a stack of quot bad quot drives </s>
<s> the worst case was a single external lacie 1tb drive </s>
<s> we run multiple levels of security hardware software firewall site licensed anti virus and our user base is extremely familiar with proper saftey protocols </s>
<s> the drive configurations i m asking about will be for single user workstations so i m actually leaning toward no raid data redundancy since the most critical data will be saved to our network storage which is data redundant </s>
<s> thanks for your input anyhow </s>
<s> if you go to a place like drivesavers they get mostly the hardware failures </s>
<s> in the real world bob </s>
<s> i m not sure i understand your post </s>
<s> we do use drivesavers </s>
<s> they actually did the data recovery on our last drive failure </s>
<s> they were able to recover just over 100gb off the drive unfortunately lacking directory structure and it ran just over 1200 </s>
<s> they re convenient since they re just across the bridge in novato we re in sf </s>
<s> what exactly is your point and how does it relate to the original question of quot sata150 10krpm vs sata3gb raid quot </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we rarely find it to save anyone </s>
<s> plus the more common failures are not something raid helps on </s>
<s> we ve seen more luck with automatic backups to other machines on the network as well as real backup systems than raid </s>
<s> just sharing what i ve seen over the years </s>
<s> if you were looking for some speed tests or such may i suggest tomshardware com since they recently did some comparisons of raid chipsets </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> combining both raid formats means extra work for the controller and some controllers are very efficient while others are not </s>
<s> you should check benchmarks for whichever one you re using planning to use </s>
<s> personally i don t think its neccessary to mirror everything </s>
<s> a mirror a stripe set is a better choice </s>
<s> 2 mirrored drives for important data and os and 2 striped drives for pagefile temp files scratch area and anything else that can be reconstructed if lost will outperform a single raptor </s>
<s> all you ll need to add is a good backup strategy </s>
<s> good info </s>
<s> the only controller i m planning on using is the one built into the tyan s2696a2nrf motherboard </s>
<s> at the moment i m actually leaning toward using two raptors striped raid 0 and relying on the network storage for really important data backup </s>
<s> make sense </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> intel s built in raid controllers on their server boards are pretty good but a bit feature starved </s>
<s> your backup strategy like most people s doesn t appear to include image backups </s>
<s> so if either drive fails you ll have to reinstall the os and all of your software </s>
<s> even if you ghost a bare install to the replacement drive s you ll still lose a day or two </s>
<s> if you don t do image backups and daily incrementals then i recommend a mirror for the os and apps </s>
<s> the difference between 7200rpm and 10000rpm drives for app loading interaction is minimal </s>
<s> for a server the faster access time raptors provide is a big benefit but for a workstation you won t see that much improvement in your daily activities </s>
<s> the raptors speed will be seen in pagefile scratchfile performance and reading writing large datasets like video editting big photoshop images etc </s>
<s> that same speed benefit can be achieved with 2 7200rpm drives in a stripe set </s>
<s> as for relying on the network as your main backup method the wisdom of that all depends on the backup policy of your network </s>
<s> aslo simply copying files to the network is not a good backup strategy </s>
<s> some type of full backup at least for your data files tree along with incrementals differentials is essential </s>
<s> thanks again for the insight </s>
<s> i think we ll probably get external drives to do nightly local machine backups </s>
<s> it might help to clarify the type of work we do we are a 3d animation studio and use primarily 3d studio max in combination with adobe photoshop and after effects </s>
<s> scene video texture and working files all get incrementally saved to the network with no work related files saved on the local machines other than temporarily </s>
<s> the only quot real quot things that should be on the local workstations are program files plugins email and such </s>
<s> sometimes large video files several thousand frames get copied locally in order to speed up editing </s>
<s> we do need to use both a lot of large static bitmaps texure maps as well as dynamic video files rendering editing hd 1080p </s>
<s> the machines will have quadrofx 46000 video cards but having done this type of work for close to 15 years now i know that every little ounce of performance you can squeeze out of the rest of the system will help </s>
<s> so i think i m going to do a striped pair of raptors and attach external drives for the sole purpose of nightly backups </s>
<s> should do the trick no </s>
<s> i m hoping to get all the pieces this week and will post pics once they re all together </s>
<s> fwiw i ve uploaded the first photo of this build </s>
<s> as for drives i ve settled on two 10 000rpm sata wd quot raptor quot drives in raid0 configuration </s>
<s> built for speed with nightly external backups for the parachute </s>
<s> thanks again and wish me luck </s>
