<s> well it s that time of the year to format and redo for me </s>
<s> my usual back up drive is a wd passport usb 80gb drive i use it constantly </s>
<s> today i was dumb and formatted it and tried to install leopard on it and couldn t get it running </s>
<s> so after that i try to go back into windows and format it so i can use it as a backup again and it didn t show up in my computer </s>
<s> i did the obvious and replugged it in and got an unknown device what ever so i told it to look for drives but it couldn t find any </s>
<s> at this point i m freaking out so i pull up device manager and see the unknown device but it s also under disk drives working properly </s>
<s> i then plugged it into my xp desktop works like a charm shows up works fine read write copy everything so no problems with the drive </s>
<s> i think i ve cornered it to a driver problem in windows and don t know what to do now </s>
<s> anyone have an idea </s>
<s> installing windows on your mac requires a special procedure and only certain versions will install </s>
<s> if this is a pc then this post is heeded to be locked since we can t discuss pirated material </s>
