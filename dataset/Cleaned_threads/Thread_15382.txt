<s> dell dimension 2400 2 6ghz 256mb ram 80gig internal hdd running windows xp h e i was running low on internal hdd space so my friend let me use his maxtor 80gb external hdd to back up some of my files then we could proceed to remaster my internal hdd </s>
<s> we were able to put some files on the maxtor one evening </s>
<s> the next morning i tried to continue backing up on my own and i remember getting an i o error </s>
<s> so i stopped what i was doing since this external hdd didnt belong to me nor am i smart enough to figure this stuff out on my own </s>
<s> i have read thru all the discussions and different problems with these hdds </s>
<s> my computer shows drive g as being available but when i scroll over it it doesnt show how much space is is on this hdd </s>
<s> i try to open it and my computer freezes </s>
<s> after several minutes it may say drive is not formatted would u like to formatt </s>
<s> now my friend did say the drive must just have been deleted and to goahead and reformat </s>
<s> i dont want to do that unless i know for sure his info is really lost </s>
<s> i downloaded pc inspector file recovery </s>
<s> this program is showing my maxtor hdd as a physical drive but not a logical one </s>
<s> i guess what i need is just a starting point </s>
<s> im willing to do trial and error i just need a little guidance from anyone willing </s>
<s> please let me know if i left out any pertinent info </s>
<s> fat32 or ntfs </s>
<s> i believe orginally files were fat </s>
<s> if the drive has been reformatted then it would have been formatted to ntfs </s>
