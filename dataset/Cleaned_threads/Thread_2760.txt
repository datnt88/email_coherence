<s> hi guys i have an emachines t6212 with 512mb dual channel ddr sdram from factory </s>
<s> it has 4 slots total and 512 is made up of two samsung 256mb pc3200 cl3 ddr memory </s>
<s> i just bought an ultra 512mb ddr 400mhz cl3 memory which should get me 1gb memory total but my computer is only showing 768mb memory </s>
<s> can anyone help </s>
<s> some machines do stop there or have onboard graphics that steal ram </s>
<s> try to see if you are in the zone of supported memory configurations </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> since i installed only 1 stick could that be causing this problem </s>
<s> i have a video card installed so my on board video is disabled </s>
<s> i won t </s>
<s> but about the onboard quot disabled quot that s not always true </s>
<s> some machines steal the memory in spite of that </s>
<s> here s what i do for the machines i can do this for </s>
<s> i get into the bios and reduce the video memory to it s lowest value </s>
<s> this gets us to the best place we can be </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you likely defeated the dual channel mode and is reportinga single channel amount and leaving out the other 256 </s>
<s> so are you basically saying that i need another one of those exact same stick to make it work together </s>
<s> i m sorry i m not very knowledgeable on this stuff </s>
<s> i had that problem before the module said 512mb but after installing it the bios only stated 512mb i had 1 256 mb module already installed i used another one but still with 512mb then i got 768 in that case the former had some problems try changing the module to another one the quot 512mb quot i had when i installed it alone was only 256mb dunno why i hope i am of some help </s>
<s> proprietary systems other than they make very little effort to make useful info about their systems available </s>
