<s> i just purchased an rca small wonder video cam and while i love the cam easy to use etc i have a prob </s>
<s> when i play back the video i take on the camera it looks and sounds fine </s>
<s> when i use the preinstalled software and play it back it plays at a really fast rate and thus makes it sound like quot alvin and the chipmunks quot recorded it </s>
<s> i even tried to upload the video to my computer without the built in software and then play it in windows media player </s>
<s> same result </s>
<s> i m assuming it s a codec problem </s>
<s> i tried everything i could think of removed my klite codec pack and thus the ffdshow </s>
<s> ran a prog called codec sniper and all is well there </s>
<s> i just don t know what else to do except to return the camera </s>
<s> i did get my kodak digital camera out put it in video mode and then played that back that played ok any ideas before i return the thing i really wanted this camera </s>
<s> or should i return it and try a flipvideo cam </s>
<s> i liked the small wonder due to the sd expansion slot </s>
<s> would love any and all feedback </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> i keep reading about this and from what i can tell uninstalling and reinstalling my sound card driver but i m just not sure how to do that or confidant enuf what do you think </s>

<s> 510 xl home computer r1 2900034 </s>
<s> if you re getting this off the gateway site i just went this route no disrespect intended </s>
<s> how do i find out this latest info you want </s>
<s> creative sb audigy driver version 5 12 1 324 soundmax intergrated digital audio driver version 5 12 1 3571 that s been updated same prob what other info do you need </s>
<s> i really want you to fix this prob for me </s>
<s> just went thru the cd disks that came with my computer </s>
<s> i ve got one that says soundblaster audigy sound card driver and apps cd contains soundblaster audigy windows xp drivers creative playcenter 3 creative audiohq creative recorder creative wavestudio creative surround mixer creative restore defaults online manual and users guide </s>
<s> sorry but that s not possible </s>
<s> i can t come there to do that </s>
<s> i will however share i ve cured the chipmunk playback with installing the latest motherboard and audio drivers </s>
<s> there are no buttons in windows we use to get drivers </s>
<s> so we have to do this the old fashioned way </s>
<s> gt thank you for digging up the model and part names since i can t be exact without them </s>
<s> here we go </s>
<s> rather than try just the audo drivers let s just do all the drivers i would </s>
<s> 1 motherboard chipset drivers are at i d use item 2 </s>
<s> 2 audio drivers are at this link good luck bob </s>
<s> i tried audio drivers first </s>
<s> followed directions rebooted and i had no sound </s>
<s> so i reverted my drive back to when i did have sound </s>
<s> i just am at a loss and i know if i return this rca small wonder and get the flip video i m gonna have the same prob </s>
<s> we may have got the wrong audio card </s>
<s> there are no less than three audigy s </s>
<s> ok the motherboard supplies the clocks for the audio playback so if that didn t help we are still looking at the usual cause </s>
<s> gt another fine mess in audio loss after the driver are the volume settings and the speaker settings </s>
<s> did you check those after the driver install </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes i did </s>
<s> so i got out the install cd reinstalled the soundblaster audio </s>
<s> after install i got a window that said a file was missing ctdvda2k sys did a search on the cd and found it and now i m ok i have sound </s>
<s> all music plays ok in wmp my other videos play ok but anything i upload from this rca cam plays in fast forward and alvin and the chipmunks sing to me </s>
<s> this just sucks any other ideas </s>
<s> i do really appreciate your time and help </s>
<s> i tried but looks like i missed which audigy they used </s>
<s> the tremor was another model so use that driver and retest </s>
<s> if you didn t install the other driver then you may have passed up another issue and fix </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> for the most part i m back in business </s>
<s> i somehow disabled the internal software of the rca camera and now just plug it in and access it thru quot my computer quot as another drive view the avi files and then drag them into another folder </s>
<s> i can successfully view and listen to them in vlc media player </s>
<s> i cannot though view them correctly thru windows media player or real player </s>
<s> but vlc is a stable player and now i don t have to mess around with that cheesy software that was in the camera </s>
<s> i appreciate all the help </s>
<s> now help me with my sound card update which i posted in the appropriate forum </s>
<s> as for windows media player after doing very exhaustive research seems alot of folks have the same problem </s>
<s> alvin and the chipmunks way too fast audio </s>
<s> some get it fixed with adjusting the acceleration </s>
<s> that didn t help in my case </s>
<s> thanks again janice </s>
