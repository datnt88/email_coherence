<s> hey everyone please help me here </s>
<s> i bought a buffalo ministation 120gb portable hard drive a week ago and it installed fine on my pc </s>
<s> windows xp was able to read it and could use it without problems </s>
<s> i copied important data some movies to it as a backup </s>
<s> everything was fine until i made a stupid move </s>
<s> i used diskeeper on my external hard drive and defragged it in hopes of increasing performance </s>
<s> it was done successfully </s>
<s> however when today i opened my pc windows chkdsk popped up and started fixing my h drive ext hdd </s>
<s> there were many messages like file record segment xxxx unreadable etc </s>
<s> it kept stuck that way for a long time so i restarted my pc and chkdsk was skipped </s>
<s> my pc opened up as usual and when i went to my computer to see my external hard drive there was a major problem </s>
<s> the moment i clicked my computer became unresponsive and computer performed sluggishly not loading many programs like firefox </s>
<s> the moment i disconnected the hard drive all the pending programs opened up and the pc was normal </s>
<s> i spent half an hour doing this to try to sort things out but to no avail </s>
<s> so i decided to restart my pc with the hdd connected </s>
<s> the problem was my pc didn t boot up for a long time until i disconnected the hdd and it fully booted up instantly </s>
<s> it was time to connect online for help </s>
<s> after hours of research i got many tips and i tried them all out with results below 1 run chkdsk on the drive when i tried to do this it wasn t possible as i had to right click the drive icon to get the tools tab in properties </s>
<s> firstly the drive letter appeared after repeated ejections </s>
<s> and when it showed up the moment i right clicked it my computer hung up </s>
<s> 2 run chkdsk through command line when i tried that the same messages came when chkdsk was on at boot file record segment xyz unreadable and after a long time chkdsk exe closed down with an error message </s>
<s> 3 use another disk repair utility so i tried the disk doctor in tuneup utilities which failed to detect the drive </s>
<s> every other utility didn t work as it didn t detect the drive in the first place </s>
