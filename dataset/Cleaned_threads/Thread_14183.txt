<s> if you have a story behind your first personal computer use get nostalgic and tell us all about it </s>
<s> we d love to hear about it </s>
<s> my 1st brought computer was a pcjr </s>
<s> don t laugh </s>
<s> at least i was able to transfer alot of pgms </s>
<s> and data later to a pc clone </s>
<s> i did play with atari and appleii for awhile but felt s w was limited as in my budget at the time </s>

<s> in hs </s>
<s> i thought this was only a toy at the time but it got me out of another boring class </s>
<s> i did work on burroughs 1st computer job late 70 s systems for awhile but only in sections of it and really it was shared system for the repair depot center at the time </s>
<s> it s been so long i don t rememebr the model s any more i think 90 or 900 many of these were used banks govt </s>
<s> sites so fixing them was serious business </s>
<s> pcs didn t show up until much later in any common use </s>
<s> but repairs for tandy one you know the 1st useful system systems were done and users really put them to tasks outside of what thier mainframe or mini system couldn t and for some dept that s my story </s>

<s> epson 80 character dot matrix printer </s>
<s> i later upgraded to a 5mb hard drive </s>
<s> cost me over 600 </s>
<s> talk about feeling old </s>
<s> and life goes on jack p s </s>
<s> hey willy wanna reminisce </s>
<s> i think this was the model of my first computer a ti 99 4a </s>
<s> they sold them cheap about 1980 the only storage system was a tape recorder with a counter so you could retreive your program </s>
<s> the computer sounded like a modem when it stored the programs </s>
<s> we used an old tv for a monitor </s>
<s> i remember it a programming similiar to apple soft </s>
<s> it came with a program to make a man on a screen </s>
<s> i modified the program so he would move </s>
<s> it would be 4 years later when i used apple 11e that i learned how to use a disk drive </s>
<s> i programmed my own word processor in applesoft basic </s>
<s> the next year i had a friend who bought an ibm 286 it had a 20mb hard drive </s>
<s> at the time people thought no one would need a bigger hard drive </s>
<s> bill </s>
<s> i bought my ti99 4a in 1983 it was so cool </s>
<s> 32k yes k of ram built in os and basic plus a color display </s>
<s> well it was color if you hooked it up to a color television in all honesty it was pretty darn cool for 1983 at first i only had cassette tape for storage </s>
<s> but soon i got a single sided single density 5 25 in floppy drive </s>
<s> i had a multiplan spreadsheet cartridge and actually tracked financial information with it </s>
<s> i used the ti99 4a for several years for entertainment and real work </s>
<s> i finally replaced it with a 286 that ran dos in 1988 </s>
<s> in 1984 i was working in a structural engineer s office and they had me use an ibm for typing client documents </s>
<s> the screen looked like dos no gui and had a and b drives </s>
<s> i had to code in text attributes the same way we do in html today lt b gt lt b gt or lt i gt lt i gt etc </s>
<s> one day the boss brought in a brand new apple computer with the funny model name of macintosh and he let me play around on it </s>
<s> that s when the computer bug bit me and i ve been happily pcing ever since in both windows and mac oses </s>
<s> o </s>
<s> my first was a tandy trs 80 model 1 </s>
<s> 16kb ram a cassete tape drive adn very few apps </s>
<s> it forced me to learn basic programming in order to make real use of the system </s>
<s> it was god awful slow and dummer than dirt compared with the cheapest cell phone today </s>
<s> my first 12 1969 commador vic 20 2nd 03 1980 c 64 </s>
<s> i miss my c 64 that was a great little machine </s>
<s> ran all the atari games and accepted the atari joy stick </s>
<s> the color was great </s>
<s> my favorite games were choplifter zaxxon and zaxxon 3d </s>
<s> anyone know if either of those games were ever made for the pc </s>
<s> i may just have to by another c 64 </s>

<s> sorry that wasn t a pc was it </s>
<s> never mind </s>
<s> my first was the 128k macintosh released in 1984 yes the first mac one of the more reliable computers i have used </s>
<s> i still have it and will turn it on just to turn it on and see how much has changed from the 1st mac to the imac and osx </s>
<s> apple iic about 1984 no hd built in green monitor </s>
<s> appleworks program provided first experience with wordprocessors and spreadsheets </s>
<s> most of that has not fundamentally changed </s>
<s> example control c for copy and control v for paste or insert were apple c and apple v respectively </s>
<s> apple was a key on the iic </s>
<s> the closest thing to the internet was a subscription to compuserve where you used cryptic commands and waited a reply </s>
<s> like quot go wea lax quot i think to get the weather in la </s>
<s> the quot fast quot response would come trickling across the monitor in simple text that could be seen moving from left to right </s>
<s> a paragraph could take several seconds </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> printing was on dot matrix printers </s>
<s> media for programs and data was with 5 25 quot floppys that had to be shifted in and out </s>
<s> i had an external floppy drive in addition to the built in drive which saved a few steps </s>
<s> all programs were on floppies because there was no hd </s>
<s> surprise it never crashed ever </s>
<s> that came later with ms dos pcs </s>
<s> though i have used windows exclusively since because of compatibility with workplace programs i ve always had a soft spot for apple computers and may again go back </s>
<s> technically the first computer i remember using was the apple 2 in elementary school in the early 1990 s </s>
<s> in 94 my uncle gave my family his commodore 64 setup with everything he had </s>
<s> then in 1999 i got my first internet pc </s>
<s> i believe it was a cyrix 2 366mhz emachines </s>
<s> i learned some light coding which is a bit surprising even to me because i was born in 83 it wasn t anything impressive just having my name flash on the screen and some simple math problems </s>
<s> it also forced me to spell quot catalog quot because in order to play most games i had to type that </s>
<s> it would have also helped if the machine didn t have a qwerty keyboard i definitely did not understand why they put the letter in quot random quot order </s>
<s> the talking whiz kid had a much easier keyboard to find the letters </s>
<s> oh yeah we also had a talking whiz kid which we got about the same time as the apple iie but it did not have nearly as many fun games as the apple </s>
<s> the best game was mario bros i played that all the time with my sister and apparently it was a bootleg game because it was never actually released for the apple iie </s>
<s> the year is 1986 my first computer mmm forgot its name something z80 then to the comodore8 or was it 16 nightmare stuff then the amiga 500 and finally the xt with a 10mb hard disk </s>

<s> i had left the country town of griffith to the big city of sydney to learn about computers i could see they were the future way i wanted to become a programmer but soon learned my maths was sorely learned and a major handicap to becoming a good programmer so decided to paint instead and set up an online gallery at have fun jenny </s>
<s> i recall paying 4200 canadian for it including free delivery and setup in december 1983 plus another grand for a dot matrix printer that never worked </s>
<s> but that computer was built like a tank and wordperfect 3 0 worked just fine on that green monochrome monitor </s>
<s> and it never broke </s>
<s> if only i d waited a month i would have been first in line for the first mac </s>
<s> i suffered through several windows incarnations on a perpetually upgraded pentium pc until dumping everything for mac s in 2002 and i feel i ve gotten my original non breaking pc productivity back </s>
<s> my first computer i built was the cosmac elf now that is old </s>
<s> the zenith 248 no training in how to use it just some manuals and disks </s>
<s> i learned how to turn it on only to be greeted by a blinking cursor following the c gt prompt </s>
<s> i had just learned how to use the xerox 860 word processor then to have this dumped on my desk </s>
<s> oh i was in the u s navy and was soon to deploy aboard the uss nimitz in 1985 such was my introduction to ms dos and the personal computer </s>
<s> it was a hp pavilian umm 7000 or something </s>

<s> my wife s brokered generic 486 with windows 3 1 360 mb hdd which the broker set up as compressed </s>
<s> do you know how long it takes to defrag a compressed c drive </s>
<s> i wasted lots of saturday mornings in the basement doing just that </s>
<s> and i was backing up my documents on 3 5 inch floppies </s>
<s> including aol s download folders which included four copies of powertools </s>
<s> when i had to install a replacement fdd three years later i bought a dummies book to get through it </s>

<s> desktop </s>
<s> wasn t any such animal then </s>
<s> although not a quot personal quot computer the ibm magtape word processor we used at work was a far cry from the normal ibm selectrics of that day </s>

<s> it was great as long as nothing had to be edited </s>
<s> if so one broke sweat trying to find the beginning frame of the document then the beginning of the part that had to be edited ad infinitum </s>

<s> the tandy was obtained in 1999 the toughbook was obtained in 2001 as my first desktop and notebook respectively </s>
<s> as i posted later in the forum my first three computers were an apple iie a dos based tandy 2500sx 20 built in 1992 and a 1996 panasonic toughbook cf 25 </s>
<s> the cheapest cell phone available today has more available brainpower than all three computers combined </s>
<s> also i played around with basic for some things but have never really needed it since my first experience with windows 9x me which was in high school in 1999 a full four years after windows 95 launched </s>
<s> hi ya my first computer was a c 64 </s>
<s> then went on to a 286 486 etc </s>

<s> i kept the xt 8086 until 1993 when i left to come home it was still working as well as the day i bought it </s>
<s> the hard drive was a conner 40mb all the ram was plugged as chips straight into the motherboard </s>
<s> according to my inlaws it is still going well </s>
<s> and i bought a tandy that actually had a hard drive which i guess not every computer had in those days </s>
<s> i really loved the deskmate software </s>
<s> it was easier to use than dos and the early version od windows however they had knowledge that windows was on it s way when i inset rted a disk with a microsoft program i got a message saying something like this product is not equipped for windows </s>
<s> basic was great fun </s>
<s> pmsl </s>
<s> it was 1980 or 81 and i forked over 999 for an all in one keyboard cpu monitor with no storage except a cassette tape recorder sold separately </s>
<s> it came with a whole 16k not meg of memory and a black and white tv tube for the monitor </s>
<s> i maxed it out with 48k of ram added two 180k single side 5 1 4 quot floppies a serial port and quot level 2 basic quot wow level 2 no less for an added cost of about 1200 </s>
<s> that doesn t count the 850 dot matrix printer just in case i wanted to print something from a word processor oops i didn t have one of those </s>
<s> i bought mine while i was in the navy living on the ship </s>
<s> i rented a motel room for the weekend and started learning basic </s>

<s> the most use i got from it was learning to program and cruising the quot bulletin boards quot with my super fast hayes smartmodem 300 thats 300 baud </s>

<s> ps never had an apricot though anyone remember those what happend to them </s>

<s> hey my first computer was a vic20 i bought at a montgomery wards store </s>
<s> i had a cassette player i hooked up to it and loaded software from cassettes </s>
<s> i had a 13 inch black and white tv i connected to it for the monitor </s>
<s> i remembered ordering software collections on cassettes from ads that were in some of the early magazines </s>
<s> one of the most frustrating things i remember was trying to figure out where a program would start on the cassettes </s>
<s> you would fast forward or rewind to get close and then you had to hit play and it would load when it found it </s>
<s> kept that computer for a while and then got a compuadd 4 77 mhz pc xt clone with a 20mb hard drive </s>
<s> that was a great improvement for the time </s>
<s> bought a 300 baud modem for it and could dial into the bbs s </s>

<s> its really bugging me as i cant recall its full designation erm they were navy blue if that helps jog anyones memory </s>
<s> that would make it 1989 the thing had 64 kb of memory and had to be hooked on a tv it could load games by a usb key lol actually the only way to feed it some data was through a tape recorder later 5 inch soft floppy came out but it was too damn expensive for me to get since then i ve gone through 4x86 66 mhz with 4 mb ram and 512 mb hard disk pentium 1 133 mhz with 16 mb ram and 1 gb hard disk and a cd drive pentium 3 450 mhz with 128 mb ram and 10 gb hard disk and a cd burner pentium 3 550 mhz with 64 mb ram first laptop home pentium 3 800 mhz with 64 mb ram biggest crap i ve purchased from hp and a dvd rom p4 2 6 ghz quite a jump but happened in 2 3 years time with 1 gb ram and 120 gb hard drive wow 2 3 years and a dvd burner crapbook pro core 2 duo 2 0 ghz 2 gb ram a modern day machine for now that s about 7 months old now wow time flies i ll be 30 before i know it </s>

<s> that was also the first computer that i ever used to connect to my first bbs using my lightning fast 300 baud modem </s>
<s> at that speed simply chatting on a ddial with 3 or 4 other people would sometimes have you backlogged for minutes unable to keep up with the conversation </s>
<s> when i got my first 1200 baud modem which someone kindly donated to me i thought it was the best thing since sliced bread </s>

<s> the first quot real quot computer i owned was an antiquated tandy 1000 25 ibm compatible that i got in 1989 it was an xt but technically it only ran at about 4mhz not even the full 4 77 mhz that an xt should </s>
<s> this computer was so slow it wasn t even funny and it certainly didn t have a hard drive just dual 5 25 low density floppies </s>
<s> in fact radio shack who manufactured the tandy line claimed this computer wasn t capable of supporting a hard drive under any circumstances </s>
<s> i found that out after spending countless hours trying to install a 10mb full height mfm hard drive brick into it </s>
<s> amazingly though a good friend of mine who was a computer guru in the true sense of the word figured out somehow that if he soldered a small piece of metal onto the mfm controller he could get the controller and the system to recognize the drive and we eventually got the whopping 10mb hard drive installed </s>
<s> things were definitely different back in the day dos ruled and when windows came along 3 11 loaded faster on an 8mhz 286 with 256k ram and a dog slow mfm hard drive than xp does now on a 3ghz dual core p4 with 4 gigs of ram and a 10 000 rpm ide drive </s>

<s> the salesperson had to write a macro for me to run each time i needed to turn the printer on so the apple printer could talk to the ibm pc they should put that in their commercial </s>
<s> i have neither the computer nor the printer now </s>
<s> i was hired as a cobol mainframe programmer in 1978 and worked on an ibm 370 that was housed in a large data center in london </s>
<s> it was accessed through quot dumb quot terminals located in the bank i worked for in the wall street area nyc </s>

<s> it was at a steel company and filled the perimeter of a large room and we could walk around the room and follow the computer s computing progress meaning it was pretty slow </s>
<s> in those days everything was done using desk debugging and a programmer had a time slot on one day each week </s>
<s> if their program was not ready to go they had to wait until the next week </s>
<s> shortly after that don t remember the exact date texas instruments came out with the ti 99 4a which i immediately purchased </s>
<s> it had 4k memory and used a cassette tape for storage </s>
<s> of course it was programmed in basic </s>
<s> i wrote a program to calculate auto insurance rates in texas which was huge at the time and would run out of memory frequently and would have to go back and rewrite some of the lines of code to gain more memory so i could finish the program </s>
<s> i would go into the study to work on the program for a couple of hours and suddenly realize i had been there 5 or 6 hours </s>
<s> in the end the program served its purpose very well and was used for quite some time </s>
