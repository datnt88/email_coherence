<s> thanks for your time and help </s>
<s> i am going to get the generic fan and try to install it </s>
<s> you would think that nvidia would have a way to buy a replacement fan for there cards </s>
<s> george </s>
<s> there are replacement coolers out there for some of the geforce cards </s>
<s> my mind didn t think to look beyond the sources i use to solve this issue </s>
<s> for the people i deal with will not part with the money for a tennmax cooler so i just use generic fans </s>
<s> however i always get a ball bearing fan if i think the card system will need to be used for more than a few months </s>
<s> hint exacto blade knives tin snips plastic nuts bolts and even plastic cable ties all make for great source material and tools to fashion a new fan mount </s>
<s> sometimes i have to take up space that blocks the adjacent pci slot but what other choice do we have </s>
<s> at least at this price bob </s>
