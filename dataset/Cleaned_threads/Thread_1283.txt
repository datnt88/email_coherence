<s> just built a new computer </s>
<s> it s my 5th one so i m not a newbie in doing this </s>
<s> i am having a strange problem though </s>
<s> here it goes built the computer and installed the os and everything was fine </s>
<s> the following day when i came to use the pc i touched it got a small static shock which then shut down the computer </s>
<s> i was quite alarmed so took the machine apart and checked my mobo install and the front of the case usb ports heard this might cause this </s>
<s> i then restarted the machine created some static touched the computer and it did not shut down </s>
<s> success </s>
<s> unfortunately it didn t end there </s>
<s> the pc ran through the night and when i came to use it the next night i touched the computer with my leg and it shut off </s>
<s> but there was no shock </s>
<s> i then rebooted and touched the case pushed the case etc </s>
<s> and it was fine </s>
<s> a number of hours later i touched the case and it shut off </s>
<s> this is crazy </s>
<s> any ideas as what the problem might be </s>
<s> i m thinking perhaps something to do with heat but i m not even sure how to proceed any suggestions appreciated </s>
<s> has a problem </s>
<s> seems that your third wire ground is not continuous from the computer to the ground in the main box </s>
<s> the erratic shut down times are simply when you have enough of a static charge </s>
<s> the path of the current which can be momentarily high should flow with extremely low resistance and voltage level in the ground wiring through the ground path </s>
<s> also could be caused by a ground wire problem within the power supply itself </s>
<s> a ups or surge protector in the line </s>
<s> is your mobo properly grounded to the mounting plate </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> hi now since according to what you are saying that the computer just shuts down automatically or abruptly u might want to check the processor fan and heatsink assembly for seating problems </s>
<s> make sure that the fan and heatsink assembly you have installed are of good quality and it is seated properly otherwise you might encounter overheating problems in the future also </s>
<s> consider turning off the all caps </s>
<s> it is considered to be rude and yelling in internet communication </s>
<s> static electricty can do crazy things and it need not be a sparky amount as seen by many </s>
<s> since this problem repeats alot at least touch some other grounded device metal static touch pad to discharge yourself </s>
<s> then proceed to the computer and continue on </s>
<s> if you walk across a rug carpet or wear staticly clothes that alone will generate the esd needed and plaque you </s>
<s> i suggest besides the above get a secerarty s work floor mat used in office s and place under your chair </s>
<s> many a mat has a metal contact button to route static to grd </s>
<s> plug of ac outlet or get that type of mat </s>
<s> remember static can be in the thousands of volts range and the simple power on off swith only needs 5v to work </s>
<s> these are simple suggestions and it maybe entirely something else but came to mind as this is the season for such problems </s>
<s> also understand previous static damage if the cause of problems could have comprised the system and its now too readily ease to shutdown for whatever reason as an end result </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> yeah i have the same well i would nt call it a problem </s>
<s> it s likely to happen to any ones computer </s>
<s> just becareful don t be going ahead and restarting your comp with your fingear cause that can really mess up your computer </s>
