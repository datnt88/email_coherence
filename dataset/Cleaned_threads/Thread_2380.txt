<s> hi i have visited many forums and see this issue but no answers fixxes </s>
<s> the problem is when the monitor tried to display older games or visuals that dont meet the native resolution </s>
<s> the monitor decides to go into a safe mode with a box pop up saying quot not optimized mode quot </s>
<s> there has to be a way around this </s>
<s> from what i have read people are bashing samsung for this on utube and other forums </s>
<s> i have a samsung tv and 2 pc monitors and love them all </s>
<s> please help me fix this problem and make the fix public so the bashing may be stopped </s>
<s> the game i am trying to play is warcraft 3 frozen throne but im positive it has nothing to do with the game as there are many posts of other games doing the same thing </s>
<s> it seems to be any older game that dosent utalize the higher resolutions that the monitor is trying to force </s>
<s> samsung syncmaster 2233 radeon hd 4870 1gb 4 gig ram drivers all up to date </s>
<s> try the override setting in dxdiag </s>
<s> put it at 60 given the lack of details and you may want to bash i ll share a fix i used </s>
<s> good luck bob </s>
<s> i have windows vista dont see an override option available in the dxdiag tool </s>
<s> it is set at 60 hertz though </s>
<s> i even tried forcing the 60 hertz function in ati catalist control center no luck </s>
<s> when i open the game it still tries to run at 75 hertz and says not optimum setting and goes into standby mode </s>
<s> almost all lcds require 60hz </s>
<s> some call that a flaw </s>
<s> ask ati how to keep the card at 60hz </s>
<s> above i stated the game was trying to run 75 hertz this was wrong </s>
<s> think im reading to many forums and getting burned out </s>
<s> it says quot not optimum mode recommended mode 1920 x 1080 60 hertz </s>
<s> the games highest setting is 1280 x 1024 this is where the problem is i think </s>
<s> the monitor wants the game run 1920 x 1080 which it cannot do </s>
<s> i have posted to samsung support but have received no reply as of yet </s>
<s> but give errors when the refresh rate is wrong </s>
<s> the good thing we did here was to move connections to hdmi </s>
<s> do you use hdmi </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i went through all the diff rez settings and the game was happy with 1280x960x32 60 hertz </s>
<s> so i guess the fix is to play with the rez settings till you find something the monitor is happy with </s>
<s> ok works for me i will try to spread the word </s>
<s> tyvm for the help </s>
<s> quot 1680 x 1050 resolutions quot i wonder if ati s 1280x1024 is not exactly kosher </s>
<s> to recap </s>
<s> must be 60hz for all settings and watch out on the second number </s>
<s> gt all this vanished as an issue over hdmi or even dvi to hdmi connections </s>
<s> ever since i changed that my kid has yet to ask me to set the resolutions </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i was having this problem setting the resolution to 1920x1080 60 hertz and i just found the solution </s>
<s> you have to on the monitor itself hit the menu button and scroll down to the second from the bottom </s>
<s> hit source to select it the hit the down button until the options become av mode and hdmi black level </s>
<s> go to av mode and hit source to select it </s>
<s> now press up or down to change the setting to off </s>
<s> exit the menu </s>
<s> as long as av mode is off the monitor will display perfectly </s>
<s> if the color looks strange change hdmi black level to normal instead of the default low as well </s>
