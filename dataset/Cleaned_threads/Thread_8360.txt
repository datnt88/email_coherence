<s> i bought usb 2 0 high speed storage crucial technology device some years ago </s>
<s> it worked fine up to the time i changed my os to windows 8 and ubuntu on my pcs </s>
<s> now i can not get it to work </s>
<s> i have been in touch with the manufacturers but in spite of their honest efforts to help i am non the wiser </s>
<s> the driver disc was made before even xp was thought of </s>
<s> it is undamaged in good physical condition but does not seem to be compatible with the current os </s>
<s> is there any way i could find appropriate drivers to use it </s>
<s> it s time to get a new reader </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if its that old then your use of win8 or ubuntu has quot orphan quot it </s>
<s> you need to move on as you already found out one way or another its no longer supported or its out of your grasp </s>
<s> this is not uncommon for any new os that gets released and since this is before xp well that s a long run </s>
<s> at least i don t see any fix for you unless you click on win8 quot update driver quot and allow it to go online and see if it resolves it that way </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> i wonder why crucial people did not say that </s>
<s> they wrote a long response but did not say come on enough is enough </s>
<s> thank you guys </s>
<s> grateful to you as always </s>
