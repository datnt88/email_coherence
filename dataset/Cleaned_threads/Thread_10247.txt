<s> i cannot find a picture at the ati site for the ati radeon x1600 pro 512 mb video card </s>
<s> in the spec it says quot dual link dvi quot but on page it certainly does not look as if there are two dvi i output connectors on the card </s>
<s> however on page where model 256 mb was reviewed it clearly shows two dvi i output connectors no picture where cnet reviews the 512 mb model further it does not seem as if the 256 mb model is sold anymore </s>
<s> does anyone know if there are two or only one dvi i outlet connector on the 5212 mb mocel </s>
<s> thanks for reply </s>
<s> hans l </s>
<s> look under connector for explanation </s>
<s> and as the other poster pointed out dual link dvi is a port that support super high res displays typically 24 quot widescreens and up </s>
<s> i use those cards all of the time </s>
<s> they have vga and dvi </s>
<s> be sure that you have a good power supply because they will pull down some juice on boot </s>
<s> the sapphire x1600 pro is the best in that category </s>
<s> they are very good video cards </s>
<s> thanks for your input guys </s>
<s> i have preliminarily deceded to go with evga geforce 7600 gt co or ko as the main card two dvi output ports and two monitors and the gs for the secondary port one dvi port and the third monitor </s>
