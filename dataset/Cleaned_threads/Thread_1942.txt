<s> it will just shutdown in the middle of what i m doing by suddenly blanking out the screen and completely rebooting the entire system as if i were rebooting after installing new software </s>
<s> yesterday the system went down in the middle of my work and when the system tried to reboot it froze at the start up screen </s>
<s> we tried shutting it completely down and restarting several times but it just stopped at the start up screen never checked memory or anything </s>
<s> finally we shut the power off from the back and when we tried another cold boot it finally worked </s>
<s> it crashed once again after that </s>
<s> this is serious i work from home and this is my work computer this has got to stop </s>
