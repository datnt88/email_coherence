<s> i m trying to decide between getting a 23 24in </s>
<s> widescreen probably the dell 2405fpw or dual 19in lcd s </s>
<s> i know the picture quality should be better on the widescreen but i can get the 19in monitors for less although i d want a new graphics card that had 2 digital outputs </s>
<s> any thoughts feelings advice or suggestions would be welcome </s>
<s> i forgot to say what i d be using them for </s>
<s> i am currently doing back end web programming using primarily the macromedia studio mx2004 suite </s>
<s> i also do some design and photo editing with photoshop pretty much at a hobby level right now </s>
<s> anyway any advice would be helpful </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> dual monitors are amazing </s>
<s> i read somewhere that productivity is increased by something like 74 </s>
<s> i am using dual 1600sw wide screens for school and i love it more than having a huge monitor </s>
<s> it s much easier to manipulate </s>
<s> for web design its easy to have your program on one window while you have a preview of the page on the other monitor </s>
<s> i have used up to a 30 inch and its not the same its much easier to have two full screen windows open on seperate monitors than manipulating two side by side windows on one monitor </s>
<s> not to mention it just looks cool when you get two idential monitors side by side </s>
<s> i highly recomend dual monitors over one large display </s>
<s> you might find yourself such a big fan that you start thinking about three or four monitors </s>
<s> the only gripe i can think about with dual monitors is that you cannot use sli technology scalable link interface i had to seperate my video cards to use dual monitors which slightly decreases my video quality from 1024 video ram to 512mb </s>
<s> not sure if that is something prised in web design but in hd video and animation it can be an issue </s>
<s> i d also recommend using two seperate video cards than running both off a single video card </s>
<s> set up for dual monitors is also incredibly easy </s>
<s> right click desktop go to settings and select quot extend my desktop quot </s>
<s> if you can find a video card that supports pivoting i d go with the dual </s>
<s> i use a 15 4 quot laptop 17 quot dell ultrashap and it s nice to rotate the 17 quot to portrait mode since most code is taller than it is wide </s>
<s> i m quot borrowing quot a 20 quot dell ultrashap and running that in portrait mode is so cool </s>
