<s> i was given a few computers that had been torn down for parts but never really parted out i received most of the parts </s>
<s> i was able to resurect 2 of the 3 minus the hard drives </s>
<s> one is a hp pavilion 7920 the power supply had been removed from the case </s>
<s> that is where my question comes in </s>
<s> there is one connection off the power supply that i haven t seen before </s>
<s> it is similar to a floppy connector design style but it is a little smaller </s>
<s> it only has 3 wires 1 green and 2 black </s>
<s> there is a connection on the motherboard that fits this connector </s>
<s> the motherboard states ps_fan at this connection </s>
<s> someone mentioned this could be a lead to monitor the ps fan but they also mentioned different colors for the wires </s>
<s> i m wondering if the lead out of the ps should be hooked to this connection </s>
<s> here is a snapshot of the motherboard scroll down </s>
<s> the mb connector i am referring to is 21 on this page </s>
<s> i contacted hp via email and they were of absolutely no help they routed me to a generic pc building site and then general instruction on a power supply replacement nothing specific to the 3 pronged wire and receptor which is where my question lies </s>
<s> i thought the lead out of the p s had something written on it but i don t have it in front of me at the minute </s>
<s> i ll try to post an update tonight </s>
<s> any help appreciated </s>
<s> that connector is for board control of the power supply fan </s>
<s> if ou are using the original motherboard and original p s then attach it </s>
<s> if it is a different motherboard you don t need to use it </s>
<s> if you buy a new replacment power supply it will not come with that connector </s>
<s> thanks bryan blake mcm an inone company </s>
<s> hello i have an hp7920 and the three wires are connected </s>
<s> anyone know why mine is shutting off when my wife runs the vacume cleaner is it a bad power supply or a power problem in my house </s>
