<s> i recently overclocked an amd x4 965 way to much and fried it </s>
<s> so i bought another one and it is sitting here next to me </s>
<s> what i need to know is when i put the new cpu in will the previous cpu s overclocked settings be active </s>
<s> i would think not because i d just end up frying another cpu </s>
<s> i just want to be 100 sure before i lose another 180 </s>
<s> thanks jred13 </s>
<s> or go directly into your bios and choose quot factory default quot or quot fail safe quot settings </s>
<s> refer to your mobo manual for instructions on how to do either </s>
<s> i assume when you oc ed you used the bios area to do so </s>
<s> if that s the case or any other oc ing method which addresses the bios then those setting are still in place unless you cleared them by quot resetting quot the bios </s>
<s> you can also remove the cmos battery besides the clearing pins </s>
<s> thus use either method to reset the bios to return to defaults </s>
<s> you will still have to reset or set the setting you require for a typical setup </s>
<s> you can then oc using new setting below what caused your previous problem </s>
<s> now understand when you oc you also push the cpu into the areas of a higher demanding cooling setup </s>
<s> thus address that to better handle the heat stress the cpu will be under </s>
<s> the stock or typical hsf won t handle well once you exceed its limits </s>
<s> replace with a better cooling setup in order to keep within tolerances </s>
<s> also the whole cooling process must be capable of handling the entire desktop airflow so prepare to maintain the proper tolerance levels </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
