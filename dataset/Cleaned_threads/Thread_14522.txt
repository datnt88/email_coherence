<s> i m in the process of upgrading my current system </s>
<s> i just purchased a gigabyte mobo ga 7n400 pro2 </s>
<s> my old system used a raid controller card with my os boot drive connected to it </s>
<s> the new mobo already has the raid installed so i don t need the controller card </s>
<s> i have the os boot drive connected to the ide1 of the new mobo but it will not boot up </s>
<s> actually it will make it to the windows boot screen but then turns to the bsod </s>
<s> the bios sees the drive but i cannot get to it at the dos prompt </s>
<s> any ideas on what my problem is and how to resolve it </s>
<s> windows xp pro by the way </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> itself connected to another computer motherboard change </s>
<s> as such it won t work </s>
<s> you could try a repair install with your xp cd then a call to ms for activation </s>
<s> the drive may be formatted as ntfs </s>
<s> dos can t read ntfs </s>
