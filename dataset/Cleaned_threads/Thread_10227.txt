<s> long story short i had to enable wpa 2 on my home network </s>
<s> i ve tried this once before bu took it off when one of my computers did not allow me to enable wpa 2 on it </s>
<s> i have3 home computers the main one is running vista and he other 2 are both xp i know that doesn t make a difference </s>
<s> and they both have wireless cards </s>
<s> both linksys </s>
<s> one is linksys wmp11 ver 2 1 and the other is a linksys wmp54gs ver 1 4 no the latter supports wpa 2 on its setup tab </s>
<s> i am able to enter the password and it works fine </s>
<s> but the other the wmp11 is a older card and does not list wpa 2 in the drop down list </s>
<s> however when using xp s wireless connection window it tells me that it found a signal and that its wpa 2 encrypted </s>
<s> so i open it up type in the password it shows a connecting window and then just goes away after a minute </s>
<s> no error messages nothing </s>
<s> and i still can t get connected on that computer </s>
<s> i ve also downloaded the patch from microsoft enabling wpa 2 but i can t seem to get it to work </s>
<s> i ve tried everything short of downloading sp 3 which one person said would help </s>
<s> is there something i m missing with xp s wpa 2 patch </s>
<s> is there a way to do this </s>
<s> i d but a new card but i m short on money </s>
<s> but please tell why wpa isn t good enough </s>
<s> we note this in our forum sticky and have yet to find a good reason to move to wpa 2 bob </s>
<s> honestly i cant tell you i just know that wpa 2 has better security </s>
<s> if wpa will do the same then i ll use that insead </s>
<s> which encryption should i use tkip or aes </s>
<s> i ve read that wpa is just as good as wpa 2 but harder to set up right </s>
<s> and that question is one for the ages </s>
<s> i will share i use the router defaults </s>
<s> let s go with the forum admonishment and advice first </s>
<s> let s not repeat all the discussions about tkip or aes </s>
<s> in other words do you want it to work </s>
<s> thats all i ve been trying to do </s>
<s> get it to work but be secure </s>
<s> there is no exploit noteworthy today for wpa that won t take months and months at banging away at your network </s>
