<s> hi all i recently bought a maxtor external hard drive one touch ii 250gb and ever since the first day i cannot seem to copy a file onto it if the file is larger than approx </s>
<s> 4 gigs is this normal or should i get it check out </s>
<s> what are my options </s>
<s> thanks in advanced bristowlicious </s>
<s> the drive is supplied in the widely compatible fat32 format but with that comes a 4gb file size limit </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i have alot of important data on the hard drive and need to possibly transfer files larger than 4gb as i work with video and film </s>
<s> i also use mac and pc </s>
<s> it is in fat32 format where the limit is 4gb as you mentioned what is the format that will work with both platforms and support gt 4gb files will i have to reformat and delete everything </s>
<s> thanks bristowlicious </s>
<s> sorry but i don t know of a solution for you except to use a file splitter </s>
<s> gt did you just reveal that you don t have a backup </s>
<s> in the latest version of macosx it s supposed to work better with ntfs than ever before </s>
<s> but ask in the mac forums before you convert the drive to ntfs </s>
<s> while conversion is not supposed to wipe the drive imagine that a few were surprised with a clean empty volume </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob you ve been a big help </s>
<s> will look it to splitting the file or the ntfs format </s>
<s> thanks again bristowlicious </s>
