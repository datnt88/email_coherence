<s> hi i have an oldish linksys befsr41 router </s>
<s> however it keeps killing the connection to all computers requiring power down of modem and router plugging the modem right into my computer works fine </s>
<s> i ve tried troubleshooting the router and i m fed up its time for a new networking solution </s>
<s> i ve been using wired but i m wondering if i should change to wireless </s>
<s> how reliable are the wireless routers and the wireless cards i presumably would have to buy for each desktop i want to give an internet connection </s>
<s> any recommendations </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i really like the linksys router ap </s>
<s> i would stay away from anything that says quot pre n quot </s>
<s> the g stuff works well and it is cheap </s>
<s> and using wpa with a properly long key makes your network very secure </s>
<s> skrall </s>
<s> you said you tried to troubleshoot the router but did you update the firmware </s>
<s> if not i bet you ll have trouble with a new router since my experience is they don t ship with the latest </s>
<s> also there is some issue with a specific isp and some routers </s>
<s> but without clues i forget what that was </s>
<s> bob </s>
