<s> hi in one of days when i was using of my pc i heared some voice from case and i realized its from the my hard disk </s>
<s> it was like chatter </s>
<s> when i got this voice all thing has locked up </s>
<s> then hanged every thing so i got restart but it continue it again </s>
<s> what is the main problem with it </s>
<s> hard disks don t speak generally </s>
<s> they turn until they crash and that s the end of their life </s>
<s> sometimes they start making strange noice but that certainly isn t like chatting and voices </s>
<s> so i think nothing is wrong with your hard disk </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> don t be afraid there is not gost in your pc i agree that hd never speaks but some motherboard does like asus p4 </s>
<s> they have a system that speak instead of beeping when something is wrong this systen could be enabled and disabled trught the bios configuration and it is very useful to diagnostic problems </s>
<s> you must check your motherboard manual </s>
<s> the important isue here is what the voice told you </s>
<s> it is the error report according to that error you can identify the failure component hdd video card etc </s>
<s> open your system case and disconnect the hd entirely via the cables </s>
<s> turn on your pc and if the noises disappear then you know the hd is going bad or is bad </s>
<s> if the noise appears then likely a bad fan or similar locate noise source </s>
<s> now if the hd is bad then you need to replace it provided you re capable </s>
<s> if you have warranty use it </s>
<s> it appears if the hd is bad it gone too far and physical damage you probably can t recover data </s>
<s> if the noise is elsewhere repair that then retry powering on system and check results </s>
<s> also take notice of any heat build up as that alone can cause all sorts of issues with a failing hd and anything else in the system that it finds the weakest and generally heat will cause failure </s>
<s> so take that into account if so found </s>
<s> it would be a good time to clean out your system case of any dust build up and overall clean up </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
