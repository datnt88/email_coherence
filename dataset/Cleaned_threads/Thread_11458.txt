<s> i have a piii 500 mhz pc and i want to replace the motherboard to probably a p4 or a amd what are the things i need to look into </s>
<s> i am not a hardware expert but pretty handy with pc hardware i have installed dvd writers video cards etc </s>
<s> any help is appreciated </s>
<s> the ram power supply and not much else can be recycled since ram changes for the p4 and any power supply that came with a p3 will be lucky to cause beeps on the new system </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> to begin where robert left off is to suggest too much has happened since the 500mhz system was current </s>
<s> the newer p4 is more demanding plus any other devices to make it a happy medium </s>
<s> its just better to get all new or any used that is capable </s>
<s> but as mentioned what came with the old system may not cut it </s>
<s> or shop for some oem that on its own merit provides a jumping point into p4 realm at a bargain but you take what you get as oem provided </s>
<s> look into a emachine or hp models </s>
<s> of course that leaves compaq gateway and ibm to consider as well they re usually on sale on a regular basis </s>
<s> the choice is yours tada willy </s>
<s> if getting a new system check out the emachines t6212 </s>
<s> its great for the price and good for upgrades </s>
