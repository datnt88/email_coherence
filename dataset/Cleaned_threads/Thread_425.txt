<s> the drive has been clicking for about 3 weeks now </s>
<s> i ve moved all files to a new drive so no fear of losing data </s>
<s> my question is if the drive really is gonna crash is there any way i can have it happen within the warranty period so i can have it replaced </s>
<s> from my experience all comp parts tend to fail just after passing the warranty period </s>
<s> most have drive diagnostic programs you can download and run </s>
<s> if a problem is found a failure code is generated and you can often request an rma on line </s>
<s> here is an excellent video explaining the classic hdd click of death </s>
