<s> anyone here have positive or negative comments about hp that i should know about </s>
<s> i ve narrowed it down to either dell or hp </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> 1 amd processors and better selection of hardware 2 regular hardware some dell hardware is proprietary i e power supplies to replace 3 you can buy them in retail stores 4 retail store support staples bestbuy circuitcity etc </s>
<s> are authorized dealers and repair centers warranty work can be done there 5 and the dell printers that they throw in for free you can t find the ink anywhere and for some comments on dell just search quot dell quot in these forums and see what you get </s>
<s> horrible tech support </s>
<s> buy hp </s>
<s> their pavilion series seems well suited for you </s>
<s> i agree i ve been using hp since jan 2001 this is my second machine the other one still works fine </s>
<s> i can burn cd s and watch dvd s and the thing only cost around 600 </s>
