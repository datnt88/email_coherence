<s> i need to take a portable self contained scanner into the field to capture archival photographs </s>
<s> it would have to be a flat bed type as these photographs would not survive a journey through the sheet fed variety </s>
<s> i would need on board storage as much as possible and portable power supply </s>
<s> output to a mac would be preferable but not a necessity </s>
<s> i couldn t find any product in previous threads on this subject but wonder if there are any new products on the market </s>
<s> i gather a high resolution gt 10 megs digital camera might be the answer but i need the highest resolution i can get </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> but i have used laptops and scanners before </s>
<s> a favorite i bought 2 </s>
<s> is the now discontinued hp c9900a photo scanner </s>
<s> i decline duplicating specs or how it works but suffice it to say it s been grand to carry along to capture photos that fit on it </s>

<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> if i can find one does it work on a stand alone basis i e </s>
<s> not attached to the laptop </s>
<s> the more i read your post the more i see some omission </s>
<s> why isn t a laptop acceptable </s>
<s> i ll be in india museums palaces archives etc </s>
<s> just want to keep my baggage to a minimum </s>
<s> don t really want to carry a laptop as well as a scanner </s>
<s> there are fine web articles about using a camera as a scanner </s>
<s> i won t duplicate such </s>
<s> but if you must ask then do so in our camera forum </s>
<s> again there is no such device </s>
