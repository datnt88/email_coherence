<s> hi just got this ibook 12 quot in the mail been to a mac shop before i bought it where the owner was told the screen had died </s>
<s> motherboard was said to be ok by the repairer i replaced the screen with a know working one and the screen was dead </s>
<s> then after the fiddle of pulling it apart again wondered if i could use the hard drive on another ibook </s>
<s> the hard drive i put in another ibook which loaded up fine with display </s>
<s> later i tried again but it was a dead screen </s>
<s> is it that both ibooks have faulty motherboards </s>
<s> motherboard determines a display </s>
<s> or could it be the display module </s>
<s> what else could cause dead screen </s>
<s> cables good </s>
<s> cheers cas </s>
<s> then try applying pressure squeezing to the left of the trackpad but on the same level you may be surprised at the results </s>
<s> the ibook g4 was notorious for this problem which is caused by broken solder joints on the graphics chip connections to the logicboard </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> hi thanks i pressed on the area and there was sort of change </s>
<s> it opened up on it s own last night and worked perfectly some flashing of screen but worked </s>
<s> can the solder joints be repaired </s>
<s> read that you can re heat this area to re solder place bit of lino in case to pressure the spot or do you just end up with a pile of un fixable ibooks </s>
<s> is the earlier clamshell less faulty </s>
<s> cheers cas </s>
<s> the trick is to find someone who can do it </s>
<s> google for it there are places that specialize in all sorts of things </s>
<s> the earlier clamshells were less faulty but on the other hand they only had a g3 processor went slower not all had firewire but they were built like the proverbial outhouse </s>
