<s> your model doesn t have the proprietary power supply that some had </s>
<s> you couldn t just buy another one off the shelf and install it with certain dells you had to use one of theirs instead if i recall correctly </s>
<s> toni </s>
<s> for the nvidia geforce 6600gt either in pcie or agp versions and you will see it needs more than a 250w power supply </s>
<s> also in agp versions of the 6600gt they normally furnish a cable to connect additional power to the power supply </s>
<s> i just bought and installed a new 420w power supply in my pc with thoughts of a 6600gt agp card pretty soon </s>
<s> don t have a dell but toni h is right on some dell s especially the old ones need special power supply and also special fitting and some don t </s>
<s> has sturdy dell replacements </s>
<s> more demanding video output are stating at least on thier packaging quot to have 350w p s quot </s>
<s> having a larger p s isn t going to hurt the system provided its quot doable quot as some systems either have propiertory cabling or rewired voltage output great for thier systems but not quot generic quot to what typically available </s>
<s> thus you need be sure its not only rated to fit and compatible but also be at least 350w or better </s>
<s> dell may have an upgrade path from thier wares or not but check </s>
<s> a good vendor to check with is or google for any other vendor </s>
<s> happy usa willy </s>
