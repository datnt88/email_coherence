<s> hi just wondering about the pros cons of the vista upgrades that are offered by the stores if you buy a new pc right now </s>
<s> if you buy a media centre pc it comes with a free upgrade to vista premium </s>
<s> sounds like a good deal but i discovered that the upgrade will be in the 32bit format not 64 bit question is does it really matter </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> with 32 bit versions too lol </s>
<s> no i don t think so </s>
<s> having just gone thru </s>
<s> the upgrade application they made a point of saying the upgrade would be the 32 bit as opposed to the 64 bit version </s>
<s> 32bit is the way to go for vista in the new future </s>
<s> 64bit drivers will be barebones until the hardware manufacturers catch up </s>
<s> ms will allow you to switch to 64bit for a small fee probably 25 </s>
<s> problems getting drivers for anything yet </s>
<s> i m running an asus a8n sli deluxe with an amd4800x2 an ati 850xt pe and 2gbs ram </s>
<s> biggest problem i ve had with xp pro 64 is compatible sw and there certainly should be more 64bit or 64bit compatible sw coming soon </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> the big thing with the new vista 64 bit version will be security </s>
<s> all drivers app s will require a signed authenticated certificate </s>
<s> there will be no opting out if the certificate is unknown as is the case now </s>
<s> read or listen all about it at the link below look for the vista security file with leo steve it s very interesting </s>
<s> lets put it this way until service pack 1 comes out i would not change </s>
<s> little to no software is even able to run on vista and what is out has been thrown to gather to get it out the door </s>
<s> remember xp when it first came out </s>
<s> i would give it 6 months after it is out before i would even look at upgrading </s>
<s> yes vista is the newest and bigest thing in years from microsoft and yes i think it is a move in the right direction </s>
<s> if you like to be upset and things not working right and just like pulling your hare out go ahead </s>
<s> be the first on the block </s>
<s> i garneted as a computer tech i will </s>
