<s> my backup pc which is a pentium 4 with windows xp pro does not have any sound </s>
<s> it has an asrock p4vm800 motherboard </s>
<s> when i did a scan at crucial com it told me that it was an asus p4v800 x for some reason </s>
<s> so i am wondering how do i get the sound to work and can this motherboard with it s current video and xp pro support dual monitors </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> find the driver cd for the board and hope it installs the needed drivers </s>
<s> as to the dual monitor </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> you need another video card </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks bob but the machine did not come with a driver cd </s>
<s> i found the asrock website and sent an email to techsupport </s>
<s> they seem to have drivers listed for download but it said something about contacting tech support first to make sure they are correct or something </s>
<s> if you don t know what board you have then that s best to let them guide you </s>
<s> found out which board i have so it s a matter of getting the correct drivers </s>
<s> thanks </s>
