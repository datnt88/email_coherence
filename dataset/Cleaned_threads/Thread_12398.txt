<s> hi i m wondering if anyone can give me some recommendations for a high quality reasonably priced color laser printer </s>
<s> i m starting an invitation and card business and need something to print the cards from </s>
<s> i ve spoke with a few other people that have the same business and most print their cards right from their own printer </s>
<s> the two names that keep coming up are canon and rikoh but i don t see any reviews here on those two brands </s>
<s> i bought a lexmark black white laser printer years ago to make cards with so i could run vellum through it and it never fed right even regular paper would jam or feed 20 sheets threw at a time </s>
<s> lemark got high reviews here from cnet but not from users so i m not eager to go with another lexmark </s>
<s> so what i need is something that prints high quality in both color black white for text graphics speed is not as important but feeding is i do not want to have to stand there and individually feed every sheet </s>
<s> i need something that can handle card stock and vellum as well as smaller print sizes 3x5 cards but it does not have to be larger than 8 5x11 if it does that s a plus </s>
<s> and of course prices is always important </s>
<s> i am using a mac platform leopard operating system </s>
<s> thanks for any suggestions nicole </s>
<s> the monthly volume </s>
<s> the hp 9500 for example is designed for 5 000 to 25 000 pages a month not recommended to go to the maximum of 200 000 it seems </s>
<s> assuming it lasts 3 years that s 900 000 pages 36 25 000 for 6 000 or less than 1 cent depreciation per page </s>
<s> doesn t sound too bad of course there s maintenance and toner also </s>
<s> but you might prefer one of the lower end printers from or even another manufacturer </s>
<s> also note that there are offerings of printer leases against an all in price per copy including everything </s>
<s> that s like leased cars </s>
<s> no investment and if it s broke the repair is included also </s>
<s> might be interesting for a starting business </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> oh not nearly that many prints </s>
<s> i would guess between maybe 500 1000 prints 1000 being generous </s>
<s> this is a business i am just starting so i need to get the clients first i forgot about the leasing option but would it be worth it for the amount of prints i would be making </s>
<s> i will check out the lower end printer link that you sent </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> they would eat up any profit on the cost and frequency of consumables </s>
<s> many of my clients are changing toner when they are nowhere near half the number of pages that hp quotes with the same coverage </s>
<s> the first thing to do is to determine whether you need postscript or not </s>
<s> genuine adobe postscript printers are expensive while others will have a quot postscript translator quot which isn t as good especially when printing postscript fonts </s>
<s> second try to get test prints from the printers you are considering </s>
<s> if possible arrange a demo so that you can test the paper you want to use in them </s>
<s> some printers are very finicky about what paper you can use in them due to the fuser </s>
<s> some paper might not do so well in printers which run very hot fusers so check that out </s>
<s> if you buy a printer without doing that you may end up having to buy very expensive paper to get the results you want on it and that might kill your pricing </s>
<s> third find out how much consumables maintenance and service are going to cost you </s>
<s> show samples of what you want to do on it so that the reps can give you an accurate cost per page that way you have a starting point on what your costs are going to be on printing </s>
<s> hope that helped </s>
<s> so i m not really familiar with laser printers is toner different than the colored cartridges </s>
<s> thank your for the suggestions </s>
<s> i will definitely keep them in mind when i can narrow it down to a few brands </s>
<s> if you say stay away from hp anyone like canon or ricoh </s>
<s> i am also in the invitation printing business </s>
<s> i have bought several different hp printers </s>
<s> i bought the hp3600 laser jet and it curled the card stock </s>
<s> it also made black streak marks on the card stock </s>
<s> it handled regular paper well </s>
<s> i ended up sending it back to hp </s>
<s> the toner was 80 each </s>
<s> i currently have an hp officejet pro k550 inkjet </s>
<s> it handles the heavy card stock well graphics print beautifully but the ink smears </s>
<s> i am still looking for the perfect printer </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> so i m thinking of a xerox phaser 6180n or possibly the 6130n </s>
<s> i don t really see the difference besides speed </s>
<s> does anyone have any input on these </s>
<s> there s black and the printer needs to mix a few basic colors like cyan magenta and yellow to print them all </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> 6180 got a slightly higher score in most it journal reviews </s>
<s> perhaps 400 mhz cpu of 6180 has better performance than 333 mhz cpu of 6130 based on macreview phaser 6180 may be worth to invest for your business for better performance and picture quality </s>
<s> however updated version of phaser printers cost much more than previous versions </s>
<s> because both hp and xerox reduced their toner capacity from up to 10000 pages eg phaser 740 to 2000 pages phaser 6130 6180 you need to pay 350 for genuine toner set of 6180 and 300 for 6130 2000 printing 5 </s>
<s> for me i have two old color laser jet printers phaser 740 and hp color laserjet 4500 both printers are slow 2 5 actual ppm color and little bit noisy but the color qualities are as great as updated phasers and most of all the price of consummables are extremely cheap in ebay eg fuser of hp 4500 costs less than 60 but you can print up to 100k with one fuser </s>
<s> 4 toner set of both hp4500 6k pages and phaser 740 10k are less than 100 at ebay </s>
<s> in conclusion if you buy color laser printer first time choose 6180 register your 1 yr warranty card and learn how to manage color laser with free xerox as help </s>
<s> better user management can increase printing capacity 500 page more </s>
<s> on the contrary if you are experienced color laser printer user and do not want to pay for high cost consummables check ebay or local craigslists and buy well maintained pre owned color laser printer </s>
<s> you can upgrade 128mb printer ram for 50 or less and you can buy any part of phaser with small part of as fee </s>
<s> i m wondering if you had picked a printer yet </s>
<s> i ve been looking for one for the same purpose for a few months and have not yet found one that i love </s>
<s> i have seen print samples from a ricoh 811 on card stock print quality itself was so bad that it didn t even matter that it could accept card stock </s>
<s> what i ve found so far xerox 7400 and the oki 9600 i have been told are actually the same printer inside with different interfaces </s>
<s> both have excellent print quality will take and print well on up to 105 lb metallic card stock stardream </s>
<s> but but but both print a light gray haze on heavy stock over the whole page </s>
<s> konika 7450 print quality was very nice but still not up to the xerox and the toner did not fuse onto 105lb metallic paper </s>
<s> i know that s out of the printer s spec range but it s what i need anyhow </s>
<s> and the ricoh didn t even compare </s>
<s> i m realizing that having access to a xerox docucolor 240 at the office has completely spolied my prining expectations </s>
<s> so if anyone knows a printer that prints just as well at a tenth of the price that s what i m looking for </s>
<s> if you have any new information please share </s>
<s> it seems that most reviews and even the sales folks do not understand our needs are different from most offices </s>
<s> everyone tries to impress me with print speeds processing time and how much paper the trays can hold </s>
<s> i care about everything but that graphics print quality font handling and paper handling such as truly heavy card stock and custom paper sizes </s>
<s> thank you for the information </s>
<s> it always helps to hear what others have tried </s>
<s> i will keep researching as well </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> have you considered the canon pixma line </s>
<s> i know you said you need laser but could inkjet be a possiblity </s>
<s> take the canon pixma ip4300 and you have a straight through feed so the paper doesn t get bent or curled </s>
<s> i know some lasers will curl paper unless it is made for a laser printer </s>
<s> just a thought i had </s>
<s> i am looking into the canon line of printers </s>
<s> specifically the canon pixma pro 9000 that may work for me </s>
<s> does anyone have any feedback on the canon line </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i would look into inkjet myself some more but i m terribly scared to see how many ink tanks a set of 150 invitations plus enclosures and envelopes eats up </s>
<s> 15 x the 8 ink tanks depending on how quickly it goes through them could be scary </s>
<s> the last time i used an ink jet to do a one page wedding program in purple ink i think i went thru 4 or 5 color tanks for 150 sheets of paper </s>
<s> this was quite a while ago so i m really hoping that technology has caught up </s>
<s> anyone have feedback on the ink life and does the ink spread or smear at all </s>
<s> i just saw that it takes heavier paper thru a front feed that is for single sheets </s>
<s> striking it from the list i can t sit there and hand feed for 2 hours while a project prints </s>
<s> darn </s>
<s> depends on the paper stock </s>
<s> not bad enough for me to complain here but your old litho operator will pan it </s>
<s> that is i have to use a magnifying glass to see it </s>
<s> it s not up to the 3 dollar cards you see at hallmark </s>
<s> as to ink costs </s>
<s> i have used the 1 dollar per page metric for years and after paying for ink paper and printer it has been too close for me to change it </s>
<s> if your clients won t pay the buck a page then it s time to cost out the printing at a print shop </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i ended up ordering the xerox phaser 6180n </s>
<s> i never considered metallic paper though that would have been a thought </s>
<s> this is all new to me </s>
<s> i have not done any invitations yet just holiday cards and i am very pleased with the results although the printer did get finicky a few times but i think it was actually because i had to few sheets of the card stock in the feeder </s>
<s> that s what i m guessing </s>
<s> it didn t seem to do that when i had a stack in there </s>
<s> it has a feeder that opens in the front </s>
<s> so far i m pleased with the text and graphic quality but like i said i have not done that much with it yet </s>
<s> i m going to try vellum out next we ll see how it goes </s>
<s> great </s>
<s> please let us know how it works out as time goes by </s>
<s> how heavy is your card stock </s>
<s> my heaviest stock is 100 lb cover 270 g m </s>
<s> i called canon today </s>
<s> they told me that they did not have a printer to meet the needs of an invitation business </s>
<s> so i called epson </s>
<s> they recommended the stylus c120 </s>
<s> it is a new printer released fall 07 it handles heavy stock has excellent laser quality graphics and uses pigment based inks instead of dye which should help with smearing </s>
<s> it wasn t very expensive so i thought i would give it a try </s>
<s> i will let you know how it works out </s>
<s> best wishes </s>
<s> canon has some of the highest volume ink tanks around </s>
<s> the series 8 cartridges are 13ml each </s>
<s> so if you have just your three colors it is 39ml of color </s>
<s> but i can understand how feeding each sheet can not be worth it </s>
<s> i have been following this thread as i have the exact same requirements for my own invite biz i love all the stardream papers and would love to find a printer that can print on the cardstock 285 gsm i wanted a color laser but i am willing to consider inkjet has anyone tried the metallic stardream cardstock on the epson stylus c120 </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> this printer is similar to the c411 but a little slower </s>
<s> i had one of the cheaper color laser printers a samsung clp550 but this ricoh printer has much cheaper consumables the toner is a simple plastic jug not a cartridge with rollers gears etc </s>
<s> i think the person complaining about the ricoh printing on card stock did not have card stock chosen in the print driver </s>
<s> this printer came with some features that the samsung did not </s>
<s> it came with a card with sample print outs and directions to print an internal file for color calibration </s>
<s> it also came with an internal page to print to physically align the print out on the page for all page handling input units cassette manual duplex very useful you want to duplex stuff and have them line up </s>
<s> while the epson c120 printer is cheap to purchase the replacement cartridges are sad </s>
<s> black epson 68 has about 7 5ml in it while suggested retail is 39 99 for a double pack </s>
<s> meaning 2 86 dollars per ml the color epson 69 each have 5ml in them with a suggested cost of 2 47 dollars per ml </s>
<s> now these prices are from epson directly </s>
<s> page yields are roughly 370 pages for the 68 black single and 350 pages for the 69 colors </s>
<s> however i know from a person who uses this printer constantly that she is getting replacements about every 2 3 weeks </s>
<s> and she does not use the printer as much as a card invitation business would </s>
<s> i actually wondered if this was the case on the sample print that i got </s>
<s> i had sent paper and a file to a reputable printer dealer to get custom samples back </s>
<s> given the generally good reviews i have seen on ricohs i was quite surprised at what came back as a sample </s>
<s> i can t say what options were selected on the printer but all i sent was card stock so who knows what they did what s the heaviest stock you have tried thru the ricoh and how did it come out </s>
<s> i too am beginning a custom invitation design business up until now i always printed with a local printer but think i m losing a ton of money by doing that and have decided to invest in a good laser printer </s>
<s> i work primarily with stardream paper so it s important that the printer i select have the capacity to print on this </s>
<s> all suggestions are appreciated thanks </s>
<s> while i do not know that kind of paper i deal with printer cartridges i would recommend the following steps </s>
<s> 1 how much is the most you would spend </s>
<s> do not look at anything above this price level </s>
<s> 2 brands to consider hp xerox oki 3 then look at specs for each printer in your price range narrow down the list to 5 or so </s>
<s> 4 consumables of those five or so that you have narrowed down too look at the price of the high yield cartridges if available and the page yields </s>
<s> figure out the cost per page cost pages </s>
<s> that will help you with a rough number of what it will cost you to run </s>
<s> okay i see we ll all be competitors here i obviously am going thru the same issues </s>
<s> i want to be able to print myself for 2 reasons control and convenience </s>
<s> i researched like you and came up with the oki c6000n another forum said that envelopments was recommending it </s>
<s> i also called mountaincow and they said they recommend both an inkjet and a laser and recommended an hp 4700 </s>
<s> for their laser and epson claria i think it s r380 or something </s>
<s> i ve had the oki for a month now but it can t handle above 80 lb cover 110 index so i need to get another any strong reocmmendations </s>
<s> anyone consider the xerox phaser 8560 with solid ink </s>
<s> hi again all the specs for the 8560 don t include heavier cover stocks </s>
<s> i know that doesn t necessarily mean that it won t take it </s>
<s> i do know that xerox is pretty picky about what stock they recommend </s>
<s> being if you put a too heavy stock through and it ruins anything inside your printer it deffinetly will not be covered under any kind of warranty or maintenance plan </s>
<s> you ll be buying new guts for your printer </s>
<s> i recently emailed another invitation designer who i found on a blog </s>
<s> she is using the 8560 with solid inks </s>
<s> she said that she loved it but after she described how she needed to calibrate it with every job and other problems i took it off my own list </s>
<s> it sounded like a lot of hassle </s>
<s> but she did use stardream regularly </s>
<s> i emailed envelopments a few months ago and they recommended the oki c5300 color laser and the epson r1800 color inkjet and said they were currently using both it sounded like they have been testing out several </s>
<s> i did recently get samples from hp and they looked beautiful though none on heavy card stock </s>
<s> yeah we ll all be competitors but hey i would still hate for anyone to waste money </s>
<s> the phaser says explicitly the go up to 220 gsm 80 lb </s>
<s> cover </s>
<s> problems with calibrating huh </s>
<s> wonder exactly what that involves </s>
<s> this was a frontrunner for me since it best mimics offset printing method from what i understand </s>
<s> xerox phaser 8560 on cardstock check this brochure out it gives up the good yeah i don t want anyone wasting money either </s>
<s> i think i m going with the phaser </s>
<s> met it in person and saw a sample i think it s the way to go </s>
<s> i recently purchased the epson c120 </s>
<s> the print quality is excellent </s>
<s> the ink does not smear </s>
<s> it handles 80 lb cover stock beautifully but the 100 lb cover stock jams </s>
<s> i have completed 3 small jobs and my ink is half empty </s>
<s> although is isn t the perfect printer i still plan to keep it </s>
<s> it only cost 79 99 </s>
<s> hpw is this printer working out for you </s>
<s> macgirl had you ever considered the xerox phaser 8560 </s>
<s> just asking because i too have an invitation stationery business and wanted to know who else may have considred this and why or why not it was a viable option how is that 6180 working for you </s>
<s> i m assuming you work with a mac so is it mac compatible </s>
<s> i did consider the 8560 but it was a little higher than i wanted to spend </s>
<s> since i was just starting the business out i didn t want to spend that much on it </s>
<s> so far the one i got has been good </s>
<s> i like the color quality </s>
<s> i have only done a set of holiday cards though so i haven t had much expereince with it </s>
<s> kimbelinda did you end up getting the phaser 8560 </s>
<s> i m leaning towards that myself </s>
<s> are you happy with it and do you print stardream on it </s>
<s> i d like to see how you are liking your xerox phaser now that you ve had it for a few months </s>
<s> i am considering your model and the 8560 it appears that 8560 will have better resolution and therefore might be worth the extra money </s>
<s> i have found that some reviewers feel the ink runs out too quickly and is far more costly per page than xerox s specs would lead us to believe </s>
<s> what have you found to be true </s>
<s> unfortunately there just aren t as many reviews of the 8000series as of the 6000s </s>
<s> and while it does a great job on the stardream papers it would never be able to handle the sd cardstocks </s>
<s> its stays true to its intended specs which is 80 lb cardstock and even then it gets picky once in a while on a side note i can t get my manual feed to work so it is taking no cardstock right now i haven t gotten around to calling tech support </s>
<s> i have spent the better part of two weeks struggling to find a printer do the same that you are doing </s>
<s> i have decided to outsource my very heavy paper projects invitations </s>
<s> most items can be printed on 80lb cover 216gsm and many laser printers say they can take that </s>
<s> the ricoh has been so heavily suggested that i am thinking of getting that </s>
<s> but in this string of notes someone said it was terrrible </s>
<s> and that is really too bad </s>
<s> you are right they just don t understand our needs </s>
<s> i have narrowed it down for today to the following ricoh 410n no need for duplex option since it can t do it with the heavier stock konica minolta 5550 both can take 216gsm </s>
<s> spoke to someone at printershowcase com and he said that a woman who prints stationery on heavy stock came in and test drove those two and chose the konica over the ricoh </s>
<s> so i am curious what did you find out </s>
<s> it s been 2 months and i hope you found something </s>
<s> thanks cindy </s>
<s> do you like the 8560 </s>
<s> how is working out </s>
<s> does it print straight </s>
<s> does the color look great </s>
<s> is it professional looking on card stock </s>
<s> have you had much chance to try it out </s>
<s> cardstock </s>
<s> vellum </s>
<s> stardream </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>

<s> i ll let you know how it goes </s>
<s> i m tempted to take your recommendation on the photosmart </s>
<s> i m having problems printing on cardstock that is 80 216 g m2 </s>
<s> i have a hp color laserjet 2605dn and i can only print on 80 if i do manual feed or pray but praying only works sometimes </s>
<s> i can t babysit the thing to make sure it doesn t jam </s>
<s> does the photosmart do 80 in the regular paper tray or do you have to do manual feed </s>
<s> is the print quality equivalent to a laserjet </s>
<s> tried any transparency fades on your graphics </s>
<s> thanks for any additional info you have to ease my concerns </s>
<s> i have been using lexmark z2420 it produced text at a rate of 10 1 pages per minute ppm just slightly above average for this category </s>
<s> when printing colour graphics however it posted some very slow speeds </s>
<s> the lexmark z2420 s print quality rose or fell depending on the type of paper </s>
<s> on the plain paper we use the black ink faded to charcoal and tended to spread on the page resulting in slightly faded and fuzzy looking letters </s>
<s> color photos also appeared faded and grainy </s>

<s> k_harms22 i am anxious to see your feedback </s>
<s> i am also leaning towards this printer </s>
<s> i bought the 8560 a few months back about 2 i think and i have been so happy </s>
<s> it takes everything i feed it 80lb cover vellum startdream labels etc </s>
<s> everything looks so great too </s>
<s> i love the raised feel to the ink the most </s>
<s> it has lost connectivity by ethernet 2x but i was able to have it serviced quickly enough and was able to use the usb connection until it was repaired one time they were able to fix the problem over the phone </s>
<s> so i recommend this printer for sure </s>
<s> thanks cindywit </s>
<s> do you leave it on standby all the time </s>
<s> i have read that you must do that or it uses up a lot of ink to power it up </s>
<s> so far the only negative i have heard is that to leave it on standby it uses about 45 watts </s>
<s> anyhoo it looks like i will buy this printer </s>
<s> again thanks so much for your review </s>
<s> okay my new xerox phaser 8560 is wonderful </s>
<s> the waxy images look very quot professional quot and it s so easy to load the ink that any preschooler who s figured out how to put those shapes through the lid of the box can do it </s>
<s> so far i ve run 5 large jobs on it using 80lb cardstock vellum labels and envelopes </s>
<s> everything goes through easily though the envelopes do mis feed occasionally </s>
<s> things to think about however this printer does not do borderless </s>
<s> the print quality is so good that you ll be tempted to want to do full color invites especially since the ink will not curl the paper just be prepared to trim off the edges </s>
<s> it is very loud when running so you think about it s location </s>
<s> i ve been having to do a lot of research about color matching because for browns pinks what i see on my screen is not what comes out </s>
<s> the blues and greens seem to be fine though </s>
<s> anyone who knows what settings to change are welcome to chime in here </s>
<s> i ve been working around that with trial and error but hoping to find the correct settings to get them to match more closely so i don t have to waste paper </s>
<s> other than that i am a happy camper </s>
<s> good luck with your printer searches </s>
<s> i too recently got the 8560dn duplexer is great for wedding programs </s>
<s> there are a lot of great things some bad </s>
<s> feeds envelopes great but if you print on stardream envelopes it will smudge rub off when mailed </s>
<s> not sure about regular envelopes </s>
<s> but it prints stardream cover stock great 105 from the manual feed tray </s>
<s> as someone noted below it doesn t print borderless so you need to trim to do your bleeds </s>
<s> my large papercutter has a peice that holds the paper in place but the pressure of it will offset the ink from one page to the next </s>
<s> so i tediously have to put scrap sheets between each one before cutting </s>
<s> ugh </s>
<s> it doesn t always print in the right spot for instance i ll put my crop marks at 1 quot and the design is dead on in illustrator but will print 1 8 quot off on the page which can make this off center when cut </s>
<s> i manually move everything in my artwork before printing </s>
<s> as for color matching it s great </s>
<s> it has built in pantone matching but don t compare to a real pantone book </s>
<s> there is a download from xerox that you print out about 20 pages worth </s>
<s> it will print all the different color combos </s>
<s> when you create your new documents you need it to be set to rgb not cmyk and for the color mgmt to be set to let the printer decide on postscript colors not illustrator and to use pantone solid coated even though you may be using uncoated paper </s>
<s> i have my pages that i use to choose what colors and it s dead on </s>
<s> great resource so you don t waste time playing with as many test prints </s>
<s> i now have three printers the 8560 the 6180 so i can print laser on envelopes and an inkjet </s>
<s> my tiny office looks ridiculous </s>
<s> thanks so much for the great feedback on the xerox 8560 </s>
<s> two questions 1 with the dn model will it duplex print on custom size 80 card stock </s>
<s> i print mostly quarter pages </s>
<s> 2 where did you purchase yours from and how was customer service and how quickly did it arrive </s>
<s> i need to get mine asap for two large projects i have coming up and i want to avoid a long wait time but not at the expense of quality customer service </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> yes it duplexes smaller sizes too </s>
<s> it prints one side and then pulls it back in and prints the second side </s>
<s> i ve only used the duplexing feature using full letter sized paper for programs but i just tested it out and it worked fine on smaller sizes </s>
<s> i bought mine at a local xerox dealer in massachusetts </s>
<s> if you re in that area reply and i can tell you where specifically </s>
<s> they were great about customer service so far he had me meet with the xerox tech and i spent hours 3 separate visits testing out my actual designs with my papers to see if it would be right for me </s>
<s> they were great </s>
<s> i don t know about support after the fact unless you buy the exteneded warranty which i have to decide if i want </s>
<s> they stocked it so i was able to take it home in my car with no shipping charges </s>
<s> they also sell the ink at the lowest price i ve found same as xerox for the genuine ink </s>
<s> i don t want to risk the fake stuff </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> i have tried up to 100 lb cover stock 270 gm and it works in the paper tray i am very pleased with the print quality </s>
<s> i say it is comparable to laser jet </s>

<s> have any tricks to share </s>

<s> i am looking for a dircet feed laser for the metallics any suggestions </s>
<s> i am in invitations business and need to feed 100lb stock too </s>
<s> i use an epson for ink jest and the cannon pixma pro 9000 invitations but the metallics if it get damp they bleed </s>

<s> i have konica minolta and card stock curls coming out and it will not do the small respond cards that i need to do </s>
<s> so please what is the best laser that is a direct feed for the invitations business </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> i am new too just 2 years in it but it really taking off and i want to offer best service possiable </s>
<s> okay i ve noticed that the red light will keep blinking and the printer will tell you to load the envelope in tray 1 even if you already have </s>
<s> i ve found just jiggling the paper envelope against the sensor or pushing down gently on the tray will get it to recognize that it s been loaded </s>
<s> is that the problem you re having </s>
<s> everyone s talking about duplexing on the 8560 i m trying mine out and the ink keeps flaking off the newly printed side on any print quality setting </s>
<s> it is slightly reduced by using the quot normal quot setting but that doesn t give me good ink coverage or photo color </s>
<s> i m trying to print double sided on the stardream card stock </s>
<s> i ve tried putting the setting on quot 2nd side quot as well but no real change </s>
<s> anyone had this happen </s>
<s> i have not had the issue of the 2nd side flaking </s>
<s> i just finished a job doing double sided programs using black only and mostly text </s>
<s> the problem i ran into was this </s>
<s> after printing 130 sheets double sided of stardream cardstock it started to jam </s>
<s> it would print the first side fine and when it pulled it back in it jammed </s>
<s> i let it cool a bit was worried i was working it too hard and then switched to printing on my stardream text stock which was the inner piece </s>
<s> it printed 170 of those double sided no problem but when i went to do the cardstock again it kept jamming </s>
<s> although since it doesn t print both sides at the same time it s just as easy to put it through the printer twice did you get your envelopes to work </s>
<s> was that you </s>
<s> hello </s>
<s> more insight to my 2nd side flaking problem it happens only when there is a photo on one side of the page and only the photo area flakes </s>
<s> back to back text comes out just fine </s>
<s> i too have noticed the jamming after printing lots of pages of the stardream cardstock from the manual feed tray though </s>
<s> in my case the printer picks up several </s>
<s> pages at one time and they get stuck part way in </s>
<s> my hunch is that it s the texture of the paper combined with the power of the feeder r and the manual feed tray pushing itself a little higher as the stack of paper goes down </s>
<s> i also notice it more on some paper colors than others </s>
<s> another question getting light shades of yellow seems tricky as there s always other colors printing with the yellow even with 100 y value in my artwork </s>
<s> i tried going the rgb route but it di d not change the output </s>
<s> hi are you using manual feed or the tray when printing on stardream papers </s>
<s> i exclusively use the manual feed tray for all cardstocks including stardream </s>
<s> i ve used the regular tray for text weight paper only </s>
<s> ok thanks </s>
<s> i didn t realize you could stack a bunch in the manual tray </s>
<s> so far everything is great </s>
<s> i have the phaser 8560 hp 3600n 3700dn hp photosmart pro b8350 i also do invitations etc </s>
<s> and work with the starstream papers pearl metallics 110lb papers envelopes everything </s>
<s> the hp 3700 has been the best for the last 4 years but i am always calling for service </s>
<s> which if youve called hp is not the easiest to deal with </s>
<s> i thought i would love my phaser but when i compare my color laserjet to my phaser the laserjet wins </s>
<s> the print quality is much better and truer to what i see on my screen </s>
<s> the phaser ink scratches off even if i happen to get my finger nail on it gently </s>
<s> i am having all the issues everyone else has </s>
<s> on the phaser the sensor not reading the paper in the bi pass tray even though its there the colors completely don t match what is on the screen no matter how much paper i waste changing the options in techcolor feature </s>
<s> i will say that i use all my bi pass trays exclusively and the jamming is kept to a minimum </s>
<s> but i still get jams and streaks on most things and i do large volume </s>
<s> is there anything anyone loves and they have found thus far that really works </s>
<s> i cannot sacrifice the quality of my work or charge clients if i cannot produce a product that i wouldn t use myself </s>
<s> anyone find anything else out </s>
<s> noise speed cost not much of a factor if i can get what i need to work right </s>
<s> i run an invitation business also and have been using the xerox 8560 i have found that on metallic stocks the ink does not adhere to the stock well </s>
<s> you can rub it with a fingernail and it will smear smudge after significant drying time or if you scratch with an x acto knife tip it will scratch right off </s>
<s> i was very happy with this printer when i first got it but i can t have ink that will come off </s>
<s> note that this only happens with the metallics which about 95 of customers choose </s>
<s> i do like the range of sizes that the multi purpose try can handle and the stocks i use go through fine so i am going to look at some other xerox machines this week </s>
<s> i think the problem is with the solid ink on that stock </s>
<s> i will post if i find something good </s>
<s> i would recommend using the manual feed for all card stocks as the pass through is straighter than from the tray </s>
<s> i only use the tray for regular office printing on plain paper </s>
<s> has anyone tried the ricoh c411 </s>
<s> hrmm that is strange </s>
<s> i ve been using the stardream papers and the ink doesn t smudge off </s>
<s> the only problems i m having is that the printer takes itself out of powersave mode alot </s>
<s> when in standby warm up mode it uses a lot of wattage </s>
<s> if i power it off on again it uses up a lot of ink </s>
<s> so the power save option is sort of my best option </s>
<s> anyway i don t understand why its waking up by itself its not even connected to a computer when i don t use it </s>
<s> i have both of these problems </s>
<s> flakey ink on certain metallic papers more than others and the waking itself up all the time is really annoying </s>
<s> i m still not certain this printer is the solution to my invitations </s>
<s> the next step from what i can see is a much more expensive printer as i ve had 3 other xerox s that didn t work out even up to 1400 range </s>
<s> on top of that i m not pleased with the service xerox provides on the phasers </s>
<s> you get delegated to quot the phaser department quot which is not open evenings or weekends which of course are the only times the printer has problems </s>
<s> they also take a full day to get their local techs to call and schedule an appointment </s>
<s> so far the techs out have not solved any problems without creating more </s>
<s> and when you call and get through to the phaser support people they run through the simplest and most obvious things that i ve usually already done to try and fix the problem myself </s>
<s> i think it wakes itself up to stay warm </s>
<s> when i bought it they told me to leave it in power save mode like you are doing too and sometimes i hear it from the other room just running and then it will go back to quot sleep quot i think that saves it from going from completely cold to hot which is why it uses so much of the ink when it goes from power off to on </s>
<s> do you have your metallics on a certain setting </s>
<s> all the prints come out fine and look great but it is almost like the ink isn t really completely stuck to the paper </s>
<s> like i said this is only on the metallics </s>
<s> try this and tell me if yours does this print something on the metallic stock and cut through the ink with an x acto knife like you were cutting out an invite with a full bleed </s>
<s> does the ink kind of ball up on the knife where you cut and you have to wipe it off </s>
<s> maybe it is just my machine </s>
<s> it is not super noticeable but not perfection either </s>
<s> have all of these problems flaking and scratching off not just on the metallics </s>
<s> on every kind of paper </s>
<s> the printer handles the paper well and is pretty easy to clear jams but the worst aside from the flaking is the color match </s>
<s> anyone else have completely different screen colors than what prints </s>
<s> i ve tried everything to match it up and did print the phaser color sampler which i can use if i need one specific color but what about a full graphic </s>
<s> i have the 8560 too </s>
<s> the waking up is really annoying but that is how it keeps the ink from getting too solid if you don t use it </s>
<s> i do see the issue with ink scratching off on stardream </s>
<s> if you print and then cut through it it will flake right off </s>
<s> so now i don t design with bleeds which kills me </s>
<s> i hate that it dictate how i need to design </s>
<s> i bought the xerox 6180 laser to do envelopes since the solid ink doesn t mail well smudges off but stardream doesn t handle too well </s>
<s> the colors separate so you can literally see cmyk as separate pieces </s>
<s> i think ultimately laser is the way to go cause it doesn t come off but i haven t found a good one yet with good enough quality or that can handle envelopes tried an oki and sent it back </s>
<s> on another topic anyone found a good paper cutter </s>
<s> i am constantly realigning mine and it still cuts crooked </s>
<s> so if i m lucky enough to get a good print job half the time it gets messed up by the darm cutter </s>
<s> ahhhh </s>
<s> if only the printers and cutters would cooperate </s>
<s> my ink does the same thing </s>
<s> i cannot use any kind of cutter </s>
<s> i have to manually cut with scissors and be really careful when i cut things printed from my phaser </s>
<s> i like how the text feels like it s thermography a little raised but the whole flaking and peeling off is so annoying </s>
<s> i can help you fix the color matching </s>
<s> first design in rgb </s>
<s> i know you d think cymk but do rgb i m using illustrator in design </s>
<s> second don t go by your screen that is extremely tough unless you calibrate well </s>
<s> instead print out the pantone spot color chart from xerox on the solid ink printer link at bottom before you start designing pick your colors from here and they will match </s>
<s> i use my charts all the time </s>
<s> you need to use pantone solid coated swatches even on uncoated papers </s>
<s> lastly you must choose in the print dialog box under color mgmt color handling quot let postscript printer determine colors quot us plats windows 20xp xtype download utype now i ve given away all my secrets </s>
<s> nice to see that we are all in the same boat </s>
<s> p well i am going to look at the phaser 6360 and see how that does </s>
<s> i am floating between that and the ricoh c400 series either the 411 or 420 the ricoh is supposed to have better print quality 1200x1200 res but the smallest size is 2 8 x 5 8 and i need smallest size to be 3x5 has anyone tried either of those printers or the phaser 6360 </s>
<s> wouldn t it be great if they started making mini digital presses </s>
<s> i just printed out a word doc with hot pink text and a hot pink small square box on champagne metallic cardstock </s>
<s> for printer settings i chose quot cardstock quot and left everything else as is </s>
<s> i cut through the square and didn t see the type of balling you mention </s>
<s> however i haven t tried other colors </s>
<s> i just got this printer and everything i ve printed so far was either hot pink brown or black text wedding invitations </s>
<s> hardly any graphics </s>
<s> i ll test more next week and post </s>
<s> thanks y </s>
<s> hi all i went to look at printers today and all the solid ink ones i tried did the flaking rubbing scratching off thing we all have seen </s>
<s> even some of the lower end laser printers rubbed off on the metallic card stocks </s>
<s> i found the more expensive the machine the toner did not come off </s>
<s> unfortunately running a small home based studio like most of us do the size expense of these larger machines just won t work </s>
<s> i have one dealer looking into the phaser 6360 as of now i ll let you know if that one works </s>
<s> i demoed the xerox work centre 7328 and the docu color 242 which is amazing but also the price of a mid size car the 7328 is a good lease option or maybe to get a refurbished machine </s>
<s> it handled the card stock very well and had settings that handled textured stocks as well </s>
<s> i do like xerox because they easily take small sizes which is a must for invitation design </s>
<s> anyways i am keeping my fingers crossed for the 6360 </s>
<s> i ve actually had a really hard time getting a good quot hot pink quot so it s interesting that most of your jobs have been in that color </s>
<s> you didn t change any of the color settings </s>
<s> i can t even get it to match it s own pantone chart </s>
<s> and those weren t that great to begin with </s>
<s> i ve only had a problem with flaking or scratching on coated papers </s>
<s> i run an quot eco friendly quot invite business though so most of my work is done on recycled stock </s>
<s> i find it s great for that and even when i use the pressure guide on a paper cutter it doesn t flake off of that </s>
<s> i have also had no trouble with jamming any cardstock up to 100lb recycled though not stardream </s>
<s> it does misfeed envelopes occasionally but if you load just 10 at a time it s completely fine </s>
<s> color matching however is a big problem </s>
<s> by downloading the ps driver instead of the one they recommended for vista i was able to get some options under the quot properites quot section that help but it doesn t keep the settings from one job to the next so i still find myself fiddling with the settings and running test prints </s>
<s> particularly with pinks and browns i ve had a very difficult time with color and i m not in a position to try another printer just yet </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i have a dahle 533 which is supposed to cut through a lot more sheets than it actually does w o fanning but it s my third cutter and by far the best of those </s>
<s> the next step though is to spend twice as much and i m not quite ready for that </s>
<s> hi i think i m a real idiot </s>
<s> i can t seem to get the right color settings in photoshop to use with the phaser </s>
<s> this is probably not the right place to ask but i m hoping someone will help me </s>
<s> i don t see the printer options that ccaputo indicated in this thread </s>
<s> anyway i think i ve royally screwed my default color workspace too if anyone pities me enough to email me directly with suggestions please send to ydeocampo gmail com </s>
<s> i m looking at this printer </s>
<s> plain paper output is nice fast too although the mechanism makes a lot of clunks etc </s>
<s> seems like there s a lot going on under the hood </s>
<s> can i get photo quality output </s>
<s> i use a epson r800 but i m sick and tired of clogged inkjet heads i made a test print of a photo onto plain paper it obviously wasn t as good as an epson print that was made on photo glossy paper stock </s>
<s> does xerox make or recommend a photo paper stock for the 8560 </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> j </s>
<s> someone said they talked to envelopments about their printers </s>
<s> we also called to see what they used because we just got their stardream christmas samples </s>
<s> they must have switched printers again </s>
<s> they are now using the ricoh 811 and i have to say they are gorgeous </s>
<s> they printed a photograph on stardream and it is perfect </s>
<s> we are also in the market for a laser that will work on stardream </s>
<s> as far as the epson we have the r1900 and i just recently had to have ours replaced it was 3 months old already having the same feeding problems the r1800 was having </s>
<s> we don t run stardream through it because it is so hard on printers </s>
<s> we currently use an oki c5200 and have to replace the fuser every 6 months cause the paper chews it up </s>
<s> epson recommends one of their pro imaging 3800 supposedly made of sturdier stuff </s>
<s> anyway i think we will end up with the ricoh just because of the samples we have seen </s>
<s> hope this helps someone </s>
<s> this has been a very informative forum </s>
<s> i m also in the stationery biz </s>
<s> although i haven t noticed any comments about hp color laser printers </s>
<s> does anyone love their hp color lasers that they would recommend </s>
<s> i m in the market again after owning my hp2550l for the past 4 years </s>
<s> i d like to upgrade </s>
<s> here s what i need my perfect printer to do 1 print on stardream papers 110 2 feed 3x5 size as well as 8 5x11 3 no smearing </s>
<s> is color laser better than inkjet </s>
<s> i don t think i m asking for much but i m having a heck of a time finding my perfect printer </s>
<s> ps stupid question is the xerox 8560 inkjet </s>
<s> solid ink technology confused me </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> for your question about solid ink it is neither laser nor inkjet </s>
<s> solid ink is a new separate class of printer </s>
<s> the ink is small solid blocks about 1 5 quot square kind of like crayon material </s>
<s> the printer melts it and so it is always on keeping the ink warm </s>
<s> the ink sits on top of the paper doesn t get absorbed like inkjet can </s>
<s> so it almost feels like thermography not quite as high but you can feel the text when you run your hand over it </s>
<s> but as you can see from this post most of us are running into some issues with scratching flaking on stardream and other papers </s>
<s> it is crazy that there isn t a reasonably priced printed that we can use </s>
<s> the search goes on </s>
<s> the ricoh 811 seemed a bit high priced for me right now maybe down the road or maybe leasing is an option </s>
<s> i wouldn t recommend an hp printer for the invite biz </s>
<s> i had one for a brief period of time and the quality of the printout and the color isn t quite up to par </s>
<s> you want to make sure to look for a printer with a straight pass through as well so that you don t end up curling your card stocks </s>
<s> i have the 8560 now and on any metallic media the ink just scratches off so until they perfect that type of ink i would stick with the laser </s>
<s> i am getting a 6360 to try out next week </s>
<s> i will post a review </s>
<s> good luck on your search </s>
<s> yes direct feed is so important </s>
<s> i have a cannon pixma pro 9000 and it works well for everyday stuff </s>
<s> but i too am looking for the laser that will do the metallic papers and work well </s>
<s> so if anyone out there has the answer let us know </s>
<s> ricoh 811 is it a laser </s>
<s> or color block </s>
<s> i am new in the field and just learning </s>
<s> ok i know this isn t fair but can somebody sum this whole thread up for me </s>
<s> i got really confused and now i m worse off than i was before </s>
<s> here s what i need i m in the process of starting my own stationary business and have just bought a ton of software etc so i m looking for a good though not super expensive printer to get me started </s>
<s> i m not opposed to starting small and maybe getting a second larger printer after i see how the business is going </s>
<s> so far my best friend is my only client </s>
<s> can somebody point me to a good starter printer </s>
<s> i m using illustrator photoshop on a mac if that has anything to do with the choice </s>
<s> i know so little about printers it s amazing that i know how to use the one i have </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> well i don t think anyone has a solid printer choice yet actually </s>
<s> i would suggest though that if you have already invested in a lot of new software and you only have 1 client you might want to outsource your printing until you have more volume </s>
<s> just a suggestion </s>
<s> i am going to do a review once i have tested out the phaser 6360 i think the ricoh 811 is supposed to be the best one but that is a very expensive printer </s>
<s> i think we all agree that you definitely need color laser for the metallic stocks and one with the straight pass through tray that can also handle a big range of sizes 3x5 to letter </s>
<s> and though many people are rooting for the solid ink printers it definitely does not adhere to the metallic stocks which is a quality issue that i don t want to deal with </s>
<s> hopefully we ll have some positive reviews on here soon </s>
<s> good luck with your business </s>
<s> i found the 6180 and wondered what people thought about that model </s>
<s> xerox direct has a good sale on them right now if they re a good printer </s>
<s> anybody have experience with this one </s>
<s> it s obviously smaller than the big daddy 6360 or whatever that number is </s>
<s> it s 399 plus 100 rebate </s>
<s> inkjets are great and can have beautiful photo output but if you re looking to run an invitation business and print on metallic papers or colored cardstock inkjets are not going to work </s>

<s> they also can bleed or spiderweb your print on the paper </s>

<s> anyway this week is the last week i can return the printer and i finally noticed the flaking that people are talking about </s>
<s> i noticed it on bazzill bling textured paper </s>
<s> when i made wedding invitations i was using a pearlescent metallic paper that it printed beautifully on </s>
<s> i also noticed that when i selected transparency a warning message pops up stating that i should only use xerox brand and any other brand might damage the printer </s>
<s> has anyone tried other transparencies </s>
<s> how about printing pictures on glossy </s>
<s> are the pics decent </s>
<s> lastly is anyone returning their phaser </s>
<s> unfortunately this printer was priced at already the max that i was willing to pay right now </s>

<s> k_harms22 i didn t see your reply until now sorry </s>
<s> i can send you a sample of what i printed in pink on the metallic cardstock if you like i just picked one of the default colors no calibration on my part </s>
<s> maybe i was just lucky </s>
<s> shoot me an email if you like </s>
<s> i am in the process of trying out the phaser 6360 and so far i am not pleased </s>
<s> it is very large it is loud and the paper path is in no way straight through </s>
<s> it actually goes in an upward direction and does curl the card stock </s>
<s> the quality of text and graphics is no comparison to the 8560 the 6360 text looks grainy and large areas of solid color have a line pattern through them </s>
<s> i am torn as i love the 8560 s printout but since it doesn t adhere to the metallic stock very well i certainly can t use that for final product pieces </s>
<s> anyways the 6360 is going back next week </s>
<s> good thing because it is pretty expensive however note that the 6360 is a great printer for a small to medium size office with a number of employees it is just not what we all need for an invitation business </s>
<s> i guess we ll keep looking </s>
<s> i am looking too for something that can handle cardstock really well </s>
<s> i have 2 xeroxes 7750 and 7760 the both curl the paper as it comes out </s>
<s> the 7750 likes to move the paper so nothing prints straight </s>
<s> the 7760 like to feed 5 sheets at once and jam every 5 minutes it also a big fan of printing the first 300 or so ok then after that it starts printing a lot lighter and i have to give it a break </s>
<s> i have a canon 3220 that is the worst it hates anything heavy than regular paper and card stock has to go through the special side tray so every time the paper tray is empty you have to go to the printer and set up what size and type the paper is big pain in the ass especially when you have to print over 800 copies and the tray holds 25 sheets of paper </s>
<s> i had a xante cl30 hse which was the best so far takes it fast print quality is awesome what s not awesome is there customer service department you have to fight them to get someone to fix the printer when it goes down </s>
<s> i pay for a service contract for piece of mind they did everything not to send someone out to fix the machine </s>
<s> the machine is 3 years old and dead </s>
<s> has anyone found anything else i refuse to believe xante is the only company to solve this problem </s>

<s> jane proud writer for all printer reviews </s>
<s> we have had all the problems you refer to and then some </s>
<s> the worst problem and the reason we are returning the unit is that the color match is not even close </s>
