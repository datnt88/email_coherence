<s> i am unable to make up my mind whether i should buy a computer right now or wait a little bit longer so that i may get a better and more advanced computer </s>
<s> it s been over 5 yrs </s>
<s> since i bought my last one i have a 667 mhz 64 mb ram computer with integrated graphics which still works okay but cannot play games older than quake 3 anyone in here got any idea of the things to come i mean the advancements taking place in processors ram graphics etc </s>
<s> if so please tell me about it </s>
<s> i don t wanna buy a computer that gets obsolete in a yr or two </s>
<s> two big changes are coming up imo new am2 socket the last socket 939 cpu is already out </s>
<s> that is coming on 06 06 microsoft vista the newest windows os in a few years minus the yearly media centers </s>
<s> it comes out later this year but most systems in a few months should work well on vista soon companies will start marking systems quot vista ready quot but i am very patient </s>
<s> these are coming in months not weeks months </s>
<s> most higher endish computer should work good on these systems but i give no 100 garauntee sp </s>
<s> i would at least wait for socket am2 as 939 is dying </s>
<s> not saying current 939 sytems are slow god no but they have a limited and slowly dying upgrade path </s>
<s> ibrahim </s>
<s> i concur with ikjadoon </s>
<s> if you can wait 9 months to a year and are interested in buying an amd system which is generally faster cheaper but only from much less common vendors with microsoft windows vista installed as the os then you should definitely wait </s>
<s> new graphics cards are coming every couple of months so there is that plus to waiting </s>
<s> the only really good reason not to wait would be if you don t care about amd or windows or if you need a new pc immediately </s>
<s> if your desire to upgrade is only to play better games then i would counsel waiting 9 months year </s>
<s> there may be some good new games developed for vista when it comes out at end of year another plus </s>
<s> unless you re a fanatic gamer and need huge amounts of power my suggestion would be to buy technology that has been generally available for gt 6 9 months and buy a level of operating system that has had some time to get the major bugs worked out </s>
<s> key advantage is that the price of the hardware has started dropping because it s superceded by the newer quot gee whiz quot gear </s>
<s> today that would give you at least a 3 4ghz processor and a 160gb drive plus a dvd burner and your supplier would probably throw in a lowend laser printer or photo printer as well </s>
<s> and you d be using win xp </s>
<s> some readers might accuse me of being a luddite but that approach has kept my computing costs low with reasonably good performance </s>
<s> hi arrow new computer or upgrade the right time to buy is when you need it </s>
<s> gt gt that is really the only factor </s>
<s> every day you hear about something new and often it sounds better than what you have now </s>
<s> i still have my 1st computer works with twin 360k floppy disks and no hard drive </s>
<s> was great </s>
<s> but when we could stop swaping floppies over and over by upgrading to an xt with a 10 megabyte hard drive it was a no brainer </s>
<s> today you can buy a whole computer for what we paid for a pentium 75 cpu to use in our first custom built gamer </s>
<s> we average upgrading every few years and sometimes several minor upgrades in between </s>
<s> all of these are based on when we need it </s>
<s> and what is needed </s>
<s> i can guarantee you that someday we will have computers that you can ask about someone or something and get the right answer just like on startrek </s>
<s> you can wait until that is available if you want to but what will you be doing while you wait </s>
<s> using a typewriter </s>
<s> maybe a lot of stick up notes </s>
<s> if you want to wait i can even send you one of our old systems </s>
<s> you pay the shipping </s>
<s> what do you want </s>
<s> a 286 386 or maybe even an amd k6 </s>
<s> we probably still have that pentium 75 cpu too </s>
<s> give you 90 off and throw in the rest of a computer with it </s>
<s> so the bottom line is know what you want a computer to do and then find one that does what you want now or wait for it to be created </s>
<s> make it a good day </s>
<s> metaphil </s>
<s> im in desperate need for a new gaming computer and have a very limited budget </s>
<s> i can t afford to look at the new high end computer componants </s>
<s> if your pc is starting to die i would think about getting one asap </s>
<s> stick to the reputable components like popular graphics card eg geforce 6800 and amd athlon 64bit 3200 cpu </s>
<s> this sort of setup will be good for gaming today although you might not be able to run on full detail and will be cheap as bigrinoz explained </s>
<s> just you make sure you get components that can be upgraded at a later date like a motherboard that supports dual cpus and high amounts of ram 4gb and graphics cards that support sli although ive heard that sli is a right pain </s>
<s> general rule for me anyway buy now but buy upgrade friendly components so you will be ok in a couple of years </s>
<s> ps </s>
<s> my first post </s>
<s> i agree that using technology that is a few months old can give you some very good value you might also plan to take advantage of opening day specials when windows vista is finally released </s>
<s> for the last two major releases xp and me microsoft and or store vendors have put together some very attractive bundles with both hardware and other software packages which were only available on release day </s>
<s> my personal experience is that i was able to perform some significant upgrades on my existing computers cd burners dvd drives hard drives video cards memory ms plus antivirus software and more since my computers were only a few months old at the time </s>
<s> in both cases i got at least the value of the windows software in useful upgraded hardware and software </s>
<s> another potential option if you want to be the first with windows vista on your block is to possibly order your computer slightly before the official release of vista </s>
<s> i think i remember maybe just getting old and forgetful though that xp was actually available on new computers slightly before the official release of the software in stores </s>
<s> if you are planning on buying from a major computer vendor such as dell or gateway you could always check with them as the vista release date approaches on exactly when the new operating system will be available on new computers </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> two months ago i bought a midrange laptop two weeks later i see it 300au cheaper at another store </s>
<s> but i don t care because its to be expected </s>
<s> please note our main computer is a pentium 166 </s>
<s> something new is always going to come out but if you wait and wait and wait your just going to get nowhere </s>
<s> computer progress wont just halt for people to buy them </s>
<s> forget about future technologies </s>
<s> they arent here yet </s>
<s> if you feel you need a new computer just get one </s>
<s> ive bought several computers over a 20 year period </s>
<s> if you think youre only going to buy once your kidding yourself </s>
<s> buy the most bang for the buck </s>
<s> technology changes and with that comes demand </s>
<s> if you wait youll never buy and then give up on the chance of the computing world as we know it </s>
<s> like email phishing viruses hackers etc just kidding </s>
<s> regards bob </s>
<s> however i have decided to wait until vista comes out before purchasing a new one having an older operating system does make your new computer seem obsolete much faster </s>
<s> mr gates has enough money i am not gonna pay for xp now and then upgrade to vista later on </s>
<s> have 2 older computers that still function in about a year i will buy a new amd machine of some sort </s>
<s> the fact is a computer is a tool </s>
<s> if you had a home improvement project to undertake and you needed a new electric drill would you wait around to get one with better battery life quicker charging time more torque etc </s>
<s> or would you just go out and buy one </s>
<s> it s the same idea really </s>
<s> there will always be something better right around the corner </s>
<s> but the quot value quot in a computer lies in the usefulness you get out of it while using it </s>
<s> i ve been in the computer field for around 15 years now and truthfully i haven t seen any real correlation between what a customer initially purchased and how long that customer kept using it </s>
<s> people keep saying they re quot waiting for technology x quot to arrive so their purchase will quot last them a couple more years quot before they need to upgrade again </s>
<s> still others try to justify buying quot more computer than they really need quot with the same idea in mind </s>
<s> but after a few years go by you see the same thing happening </s>
<s> the quot power user quot types and those who just have to own the latest thing for the quot bragging rights quot of it feel like it s time for another upgrade in 2 3 years anyway </s>
<s> most of the others just get by with whatever they bought for long after other people keep telling them it s quot way out of date quot </s>
<s> heck if you need the system then buy what suits you </s>
<s> things are going to change soon enough once ms vista becomes available and h w etc will need to change over or adapt to it </s>
<s> it will be the next driving force of the windoze based systems </s>
<s> though you can skip along to keep up it maybe a waste to buy a budget system when vista will practically demand higher end componets and or resources so it may well pay to wait until it is available </s>
<s> as i see it a decent xp system is pretty awful to leave just to get the next new os </s>
<s> alot depends on your needs so decide </s>
<s> if this isn t a critial time then wait otherwise buy </s>
<s> understand also things change relativly quickly in computers now so buy what you truly quot need quot and alittle to grow on </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> accept that and buy what you want today </s>
<s> if you keep your computers for several years most of the parts will be different incompatible regardless of whether you wait a bit </s>
<s> if you want a faster socket am2 cpu in a year or two you ll probably want a new motherboard with the latest chipset to go with it along with higher grade ram that ll be much cheaper by then </s>
<s> i d get an athlon 64 x2 cpu 1gb or 2gb of ram preferably a nvidia chipset gateway s new retail store machines look interesting and should integrated graphics prove inadequate drop in a geforce 7600 pcie card in a month or two when they come out should be a good midrange card or go straight to the 7900 if your power supply can handle it </s>
<s> get a good 19 quot or larger lcd monitor </s>
<s> gateway s 21 quot widescreen lcd looks very interesting </s>
<s> if you ever buy a hdtv tuner or even just play dvds you ll appreciate widescreens </s>
<s> that will be enough for 64 bit windows vista late this year 2gb ram preferably ram is cheap easy to upgrade later though </s>
<s> you ll want the dualcore x2 cpu </s>
<s> there s a lot to be said for custom building your own pc but these days it s cheaper to buy a prebuilt machine at the big box retailers when they re on sale </s>
<s> i custom build because i m constantly upgrading components </s>
<s> ymmv </s>
<s> i m hopeing that my 2002 computer keeps going until i can replace it with a vista preinstalled system </s>
<s> i don t want another computer with winxp preinstalled because it seems to be a fundementally insecure operating system </s>
<s> and no i don t want an apple computer and i don t want to change to linux </s>
<s> what makes you think that vista will be any safer than xp was after it was initially released </s>
<s> i like to upgrade every 2 3 years at least my box </s>
<s> i seem to be able to get a monitor to last longer my approach is to buy last years technology that is closing out at good prices today </s>
<s> the advantage for me is that i m upgrading steadily but not at the cost of buying today s latest and greatest machines </s>
<s> also i m not the guinea pig having to discover and work out the bugs on the quot latest and greatest quot </s>
<s> i like to watch the forums and reviews and see what others experiences are so i can make an educated choice when i do purchase something </s>
<s> i like the reviews from regular users in addtion to the quot official quot reviewers </s>
<s> i m not so sure about the new operating system that s coming i hear there may be some tradeoffs but i know what to expect from xp and it works great as far as i m concerned </s>
<s> is the new operating system something really good for us users </s>
<s> or is it just another way for companies to make a ton more money </s>
<s> i think waiting a long time and trying to get the quot perfect quot machine is like torture and puts too much weight on the decision </s>
<s> i don t need my decision to last 5 or 10 years </s>
<s> i know i m going to be upgrading again in a couple of years or maybe sooner if it turns out one of the newer machines has a feature i really like </s>
<s> the reality for me has been that the newer machines have some gains but also some losses like you mentioned losing the use of some old software that you like but the new systems don t support </s>
<s> gains in processing speed and storage space can be irrelevant if your favorite software won t even run on the system </s>
<s> as others have mentioned it really depends on what you want to accomplish </s>
<s> how much money do you have to spend </s>
<s> i figure on about around 300 year keeps me moving forward technologically at what feels like a cost i m willing to pay </s>
<s> at that rate i don t feel so bad if the system i get isn t quot perfect quot plus i know it s temporary </s>
<s> right now i have my eye on the emachines amd64 3500 machine </s>
<s> it packs a lot of power for the price </s>
<s> it was being demonstrated at best buy one day running one of the most popular war games with ease </s>
<s> this machine with a meg of ram was available for around 500 </s>
<s> for my money that s a lot of computing power </s>
<s> if money were no object i d shoot for a more advanced gamers machine with the specialty graphics card etc </s>
<s> i d expect to spend over a 1000 for such a machine </s>
<s> but i wouldn t expect to upgrade this type of machine every other year like i do with the less expensive ones i buy </s>
<s> by the way emachines have had some challenges with reliability in the past but they have gotten a lot better in recent years </s>
<s> personally i ve owned a couple with only minor problems with heavy usage </s>
<s> i have no problem buying that brand if it s great value </s>
<s> if hp has a machine that matches up and it s only slightly more i would go with hp </s>
<s> i like hp </s>
<s> my current box is a compaq my 3rd compaq and it s fine too </s>
<s> finally i wouldn t ever buy used when there are such great deals on excellent systems being closed out to make way for the quot latest and greatest quot </s>
<s> happy hunting </s>
<s> buy now </s>
<s> the most important thing to remember about aiming at a moving target is to take a shot </s>
<s> the pc market will always be in flux and the next great shiny new thing will always be around the corner </s>
<s> you can continue to lead it forever until its gone </s>
<s> but if you had taken that shot youd probably be enjoying a feast today </s>
<s> and yes the bright new shiny technologies will have their flaws they always do </s>
<s> only time in the hands of millions of consumers and hopefully feedback and fixes will improve any new toys maturity </s>
<s> in your case i d say take that shot now </s>
<s> there is nothing magical about the new processor or os that should make you wait </s>
<s> they will not be an end all </s>
<s> they will simply be another stepping stone in this endless flow </s>
<s> whether those stepping stones will be short lived or not cannot be known until they come out and are in the hands of millions </s>
<s> this is more so for the os than the cpu </s>
<s> but given what you have today i d say its past time to make that leap </s>
<s> if you do choose to wait to buy the new stuff i d say wait a good 6 months after the processor is released and a good 18 months after the os is released </s>
<s> alternatively you can wait until they are released to drive down the cost of todays bright new shiny toys </s>
<s> i always assume that when i buy the latest and greatest i am going to essentially be a beta tester </s>
<s> sometimes i want to and sometimes i don t </s>
<s> if you are feeling like you want to pay through the nose for the privilege of being an unpaid beta tester for these new technologies then by all means wait and buy the new toys when they first come out </s>
<s> in this case i dont think they offer that much for me to pay for that privilege </s>
<s> id buy now let the new stuff mature and buy later </s>
<s> you would be quot waiting quot forever </s>
<s> i have read through all of the responses to your question and while everyone who replies to a call for help thinks that the advice they have given is correct it is not quite always so or at least not quite accurate </s>
<s> i don t mean to offend anyone and while i m sure that some of my advice has caused others to roll their eyes the advice given by everyone is because it is what the people believe to be true in their own experiences </s>
<s> i agree with quite a bit of what was said but a lot of it will depend on how knowledgeable you are and how much experience you have as to whether it will help you </s>
<s> first off you need to decide how serious of a quot gamer quot you want to be or if you are just trying to quot catch up quot to the technology </s>
<s> if it is serious gaming that your after i m afraid you will never be up to date as games are created faster than the average person can afford to update their hardware to match </s>
<s> also for gaming it is going to cost at lot more than if you are just using a computer for everyday quot stuff quot at least if your serious about gaming </s>
<s> you decide </s>
<s> next the os </s>
<s> i give those unafraid souls who go through the trials tribulations of any new operating system great credit </s>
<s> without them none of the bugs would be found and if they can fixed </s>
<s> i have used every os since dos 2 0 with the exception of me and nt and i have always waited for at least a year except with dos or longer to wait for the bugs to be worked out which has never really happened anyway </s>
<s> right now i use xp pro on my main system and windows 98 se on my other computers </s>
<s> my reason for that is that i wanted xp for the video work capabilities and i like 98 the best for ease of use i configure xp to look like 98 </s>
<s> as for vista i won t even think about it for a year or two if at all </s>
<s> one thing to bear in mind when buying a computer from a store is that 95 of the time or higher you only buy the rights to use the os that has been pre installed and do not get a system disk with the computer </s>
<s> and if you have your own disk at home already you don t need it pre installed anyway along with most of the other crap that is installed </s>
<s> i have also found that i can build a system cheaper than i can buy one usually with some better features </s>
<s> now i realise that not everyone is comfortable with building their own but in my experience it is the best way to go </s>
<s> i always compare a deal from one of the big stores the ones that always show the price after your mail in rebate and then price out the same or comparable system from my supplier the thing with buying one of these quot deals quot is that you have to ask yourself if you need all the extras that usually come along with it </s>
<s> so my advice to you from my experience is to determine what you want to do right now with a computer shop around at the bigger stores and go to the smaller computer stores as well decide if you want to start to learn more and build one yourself decide how much you want to spend to start and then get it </s>
<s> the biggest problem that one encounters is that no matter how quot up to date quot the hardware is that you get now it will be quot out of date quot within a few months </s>
<s> there is always something bigger faster and quot better quot coming out so it is virtually impossible to keep quot up to date quot </s>
<s> there really isn t a quot correct quot answer to your question or a wrong answer for that matter </s>
<s> it just boils down to what you want and if you are willing to learn new things and to take some chances on your own abilities </s>
<s> what works for me will not always work for the next guy or gal and for every positive argument or suggestion there is always a negative one as well </s>
<s> i could continue to go with the pros and cons of all the hardware software etc but it really wouldn t help a lot if you don t understand all that is being said </s>
<s> research is your best weapon </s>
<s> best of luck and remember there are no stupid questions if you do not know the answers </s>
<s> that can be a tough question but if consider a few factors you can usually come to a decision </s>
<s> first does the computer you have now meet all of your needs or at least enough of them to satisfy you </s>
<s> second if the answer to the first question is no then what is your budget for buying a computer </s>
<s> third make a list of the specs you require or want and compare it and your budget to the various deals you find either in a store or online </s>
<s> finally when you found some that fit into those parameters check out what various forums review sites and even friends to see what they think about them </s>
<s> then weigh all of these factors and see which one or ones come out on top </s>
<s> sometimes you may have to compromise a little either on specs or budget to get the computer that best meets your needs </s>
<s> also keep in mind that spending a little more money on a system that is more readily upgradable can prove worth your while in the future when technology changes </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> the real question is how much money do you want to spend on a computer now </s>
<s> everyone wants to live out there on the bleeding edge of technology but few of us can </s>
<s> you are in the unique position of living at a major change in technology </s>
<s> you could buy now and get the top of the line 32 bit pcs for a reasonable price or as i would advise waite a while let the new 64 bit dual core pcs come down in price and buy one of them </s>
<s> let intel and amd fight it out and buy the winner </s>
<s> the 64 bit is the future </s>
<s> i say look forward because standing still is going backward </s>
<s> remember buy the best computer core mother board cpu and memory you can afford </s>
<s> you can always add to it as your finances permit </s>
<s> i think it s best to buy an inexpensive computer every year and sell the old one usually on ebay </s>
<s> i like to buy refurbished machines on ebay compusaauctions com or ubid </s>
<s> i can save 25 or more over retail </s>
<s> my current computer is an hp 3800 that i paid 525 for retail was 719 </s>
<s> i sold my hp 3400 for 400 </s>
<s> my total upgrade cost this year was only 125 </s>
<s> in just few months by both intel and amd that are not backwards compatible </s>
<s> for example i understand windows vista is going to be 64 bit operating system 32 bit available </s>
<s> for how long </s>
<s> and amd is or has just lauched am2 64 bit processor that needs a new motherboard to go with </s>
<s> it seems that in general graphics cards evolve faster than other hardware these days but most of that processing power is really used only in the latest games </s>
<s> at the moment there are not that much of software that can utilise 64 bit processors especially dual core ones and not too long we most likely see 4 core ones but soon the situation may be that new software comes with two flavours for 32 and 64 bit processors </s>
<s> as intel has stopped producing 32 it processors correct me if i m wrong i don t think microsoft produce or support software for 32 bit machines much longer especially with the lauch of vista </s>
<s> if your money is burning in your pocket buy at least a computer with 64 bit processor </s>
<s> amd s socket 939 is the latest of old architecture but you can buy the cheapest 64 bit processor now and wait for the dual core processors to drop prices further a simple bios upgrade will allow the change </s>
<s> or you could just buy a new motherboard kit motherboard processor and ram and keep the rest of the hardware from your old system giving you a litle extra towards a best graphics card you can afford </s>
<s> many companies offer special price for these kits and it guarantees that the hardware will be compatible </s>
<s> make sure the motherboard has pci express port for the graphics card for future proofing </s>
<s> i am pretty much of a novice when it comes to computers but if i can do a simple upgrade anyone can </s>
<s> there is very little that go wrong these days as long as you have done your homework about compatibility of a few things and there is plenty of help availale on internet </s>
<s> usually vendors are also happy to give you advice if there is a known problem with the compatibility of your chosen componenets </s>
<s> with upgrading building your systemm yourself there is also the satisfaction of knowing the innards of your computer and you are not tied to one sellers choice </s>
<s> it also allows you to spread the cost meaning that you can afford better quality than if you bought the whole system all at once </s>
<s> formatting a hard disk maybe even installing os can be a bit daunting but you could pay a small sum for a friendly computer repair shop to do this for you if you cannot enlist a friend </s>
<s> as for future proofing there is no such thing </s>
<s> my rule of thumb is to buy the best system you can afford for your needs now </s>
<s> there are big changes coming in just few months by both intel and amd that are not backwards compatible </s>

<s> meanwhile your 64 bit processor is just as happy to work with your 32 bit software including os </s>
<s> while the latest technology is expensive at first and maybe buggy and there is not that much of choice of hardware motherboards etc the price of slightly older hardware will become more affordable </s>
<s> or you could just buy a new motherboard kit motherboard processor and ram and keep the rest of the hardware from your old system giving you a litle extra towards a best graphics card you can afford </s>

<s> as for future proofing there is no such thing </s>
<s> my rule of thumb is to buy the best system you can afford for your needs now </s>
<s> i don t upgrade often don t buy bleeding edge technology and keep my pcs in service for several years typically more than 5 </s>
<s> i do this by gradual upgrades </s>
<s> i ve found a local white box store that will configure a system to my specifications and needs </s>
<s> they re not cheap because my requirements are complex but the resulting systems are almost always a lot less expensive than those from the brand name places </s>
<s> usually this process starts with choosing with their help a motherboard with the fastest available fsb that is compatible with a really fast cpu with a really cheap cpu and with more ram than i ll ever need </s>
<s> then i add the very slowest and cheapest cpu compatible with that board and the least memory possible to run the operating system </s>
<s> i try to buy a stand alone version of the os so i can re install it myself as needed </s>
<s> add peripherals as needed be sure to include a floppy drive they re too cheap to leave out and a linux compatible modem so i can convert it to a linux box for use with a few dial up sites when it becomes too obsolete </s>
<s> then i monitor the cpu and ram prices for the next two or three years </s>
<s> when they come down far enough i max out the board </s>
<s> in the end this can be less expensive </s>
<s> for example my current box is maxed out with a 2 8 ghz p4 when i first bought it i got a 1 7 ghz celeron for 120 iirc when the 2 8 ghz p4s were selling for somewhere between 700 and 900 </s>
<s> a few years later i replaced the celeron with a 2 8 ghz p4 for around 200 plus a pitiful trade in on the celeron and in the process upgraded from a 400 mhz fsb processor to a 533 mhz fsb processor </s>
<s> total outlay for cpu 320 rather than somewhere between 700 and 900 </s>
<s> i also quadrupled the ram because those prices had also come down </s>
<s> in addition of course i upgraded the various drives as needed and as new technology became available </s>
<s> meanwhile i converted my old box acquired in 1999 into a dual boot w98 se suse linux 8 1 pro box and still use it </s>
<s> so far i have an aging computer it s not as aged as many but there are some problems i dispise namely the burnt out ram slot on my 4 year old motherboard </s>
<s> the board is no longer manufactured 2 0 ghz celerons are obsolete as is my graphics card a nvidia fx5200 </s>
<s> tbough i don t need a new pc right out i know what i will need </s>
<s> i will probebly utilize new technologies such as the mobile 64bit processors and upgradable laptop graphics cards </s>
<s> i also don t want some dull little notebook so i m choosing a more expensive high end manufacturer alienware </s>
<s> though many people avoid alienware because of prices and bad reviews remember they test the machine more than other companies will test their machines </s>
<s> this leads to a more stable system which is a very good thing </s>
<s> however i know my requirements for what i do and i have calculated release times on new software based on past releases </s>
<s> for example the sims 2 was released in 2004 each ep about 9 monthes later </s>
<s> however the sims 1 was released in 1999 this leads me to believe that if they stay on scedule the sims 3 should be released by 2009 i m going away to college in 2009 so it s a no brainer that i choose to go with a less expensive xp machine which i will keep for ubuntu linux when xp is obsolete </s>
<s> also remember popular release dates </s>
<s> 98se very popular was released in 1998 replaced totally by xp in 2004 that is a 6 year life </s>
<s> xp is on year 3 right now half through it s reign </s>
<s> the choice is yours </s>
<s> i explained how i came about mine </s>
<s> hello there i am our companies it purchasing tech </s>
<s> i can tell you that if you are interested in a dell computer the best offers they make are in january of each year </s>
<s> so if you are looking to buy a computer in say november i would wait until january </s>
<s> if you are looking in say february you probably won t want to wait that long </s>
<s> also at least with their business division they seem to have much more leeway when it comes to shipping costs so i would definetly quot ask quot if you are speaking with a quot live quot dell sales person </s>

<s> but a 5 year old machine is ripe for replacement </s>
<s> you should just be careful to make sure it is future proofed because the next version of windows windows vista demands a lot of firepower </s>

<s> my point is that there is no reason to panic as long as you have backed up all the important files and have the necessary disks to re install software a habit you should adopt regardless of the age of your computer </s>
<s> if something does fail it is not usually all of the components at once but you are quite justified to upgrade at least the failed component and anything that is closely dependent on it </s>

<s> there are so many computers on the market that look great smell great and look good on paper </s>
<s> check for what you want though </s>
<s> if you re a hardcore gamer build one yourself </s>
<s> that way is super cheap and not overpriced like buying a prefabbed one like hp dell sony and gateway </s>
<s> most of the computer distributers mark up the price by 200 or more and try to include quot free quot stuff when you buy </s>
<s> besides the day you buy it is considered old and almost priceless </s>
<s> i noticed that one of our biggest computer shops is advertising everything at 50 discount </s>
<s> to me that means there is something in the wind and made me decide to wait until after mid year before replacing my computer </s>
<s> when the new stuff comes out give it 4 to 6months and then look around </s>
<s> being a keen flight simmer i always need the best but i have woken up to the fact that it is better to wait until all the kinks have been sorted out before buying </s>
<s> being that you recommended an emachine and that it has a meg of ram i wouldn t agree with your recommendation </s>
<s> emachines always have issues so buy a warranty if you do want to purchase one </s>
<s> agreed </s>
<s> never buy version 1 0 of anything wait at least for v1 1 </s>
<s> i bought an emachine to save a few and i don t know how they did it but they installed a screwed up copy of xp </s>
<s> didn t have a cd to erase and start over </s>
<s> what a mess </s>
<s> first let s assume you are a quot normal quot person living modestly because you have yet to win the quot big quot lottery </s>
<s> of course there will be new technologies such as amd s am2 socket but with all new technologies come premium prices </s>
<s> when intel or amd introduce new technology they heavily discount the quot older quot technology </s>
<s> by quot older quot i mean by only a few months </s>
<s> the big question is what do you use your computer for </s>
<s> for the latest and greatest games you really don t need the latest and greatest technology just an excellent graphic s card and enough 1gb ram </s>
<s> video editing is a different story </s>
<s> you should definately consider building a system yourself it is not difficult and there are forums full of people who will help </s>
<s> the price of an ati x800xt graphics card is half of what it was just six months ago </s>
<s> intel is approaching another price cut in its processors about six weeks </s>
<s> a good motherboard will run you only 100 150 </s>
<s> i would suggest you browse around a site like newegg com and see how much the parts cost for what you want and then make a decision </s>
<s> you may wait for new technology but that technology will have a high price tag and may not be all that much better as in ddr2 over ddr and especially rdram </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> altho waiting is a good idea its not definate </s>
<s> the newest x2 amd s on the 939 socket are awesome chips </s>
<s> even the entry level 3800 x2 will blow your mind next to that 667 mhz you have now </s>
<s> as for vista its a dumb move to install that right away </s>
<s> it took ms months to fix xp when it first came out </s>
<s> so my opinion is get xp pro sp2 and an amd x2 3800 with 1 gig of ram with a 6800gt video card and id say youll be ok for the next 2 years </s>
<s> you said it took ms months to fix xp when it first came out </s>
<s> in reality the xp is still ful of bugs and security holes </s>
<s> the truth is that operation systems never get working properly before the next one comes out and soon after that the support of the old one ceases </s>
<s> the question is how functional you want it to be before you buy it </s>
<s> i doubt i would upgrade to vista untill about mid cycle and only then if my software won t run on the old one </s>
<s> remember though that every os from microsoft has just about doubled the resource requirements memory hard drive space so take this account when you budget your pc </s>
<s> also as fas i understand it the amd s amt2 does not take s 939 processors or any other existing one but needs a new processor type altogether </s>
<s> your system is too old for this i am upgrading mine to 64bit </s>
<s> i am also increasing my ram to 4gb </s>
<s> my system was purchased last summer </s>
<s> i am in an a class </s>
<s> one of my instructors advised me on what to do </s>
<s> i reserched my motherboard and chipset </s>
<s> i will be ready for vista </s>
<s> i think you should get a new ststem but first research </s>
<s> find out if you need vista </s>
<s> if not you may be able to get a good deal on a 32bit system </s>
<s> buy when the next processor comes out but don t buy the top of the line </s>
<s> buy the second or third from the top </s>
<s> it will be so fast compaired to what you have </s>
<s> you ll need to think about a couple of things </s>
<s> one a mother with maybe ht technology and of course buy at least 2gig of ram </s>
<s> after that load your o s </s>
<s> and then you can maybe use some of the hardware from your old pc </s>
<s> just check for compatabillity with old and new good luck </s>
<s> my pc is older than yours and i m going to price some new stuff first of the week </s>
<s> if you re going to wait for the new processor i d go ahead and wait for software designed for it to hit the market </s>
<s> that will allow enough time for the first wave of issues to be sifted through </s>
<s> this could take as long as 12 months </s>
<s> i agree for the most part on what you just said but i don t where you got your info on amd processors not being socket 939 compatable </s>
<s> check out the link and google amd if you want more proof not only are they s939 compatable but also even with their dual core processors </s>
<s> when tring to decide which processor to use you also need to research motherboards to see which processers can be used with which mb and if the mb has a good reputation as well </s>
<s> although while going for the newest and biggest may seem like a good idea it pays to check out any all info that you can find before buying so that you don t end up getting a mb processor and then finding your other parts don t work with them </s>
<s> reasearch research research is the key </s>
<s> i am in the process of buying the parts to build another computer and have already looked at the so called top of the line cpu s and mb s and now i am working my way down </s>
<s> if i were building it for myself for gaming maybe but for someone who justs wants a good compter that will still be fairly fast up to date in a couple of years one doesn t need to get that fancy </s>
<s> computers will get obselete regardless in 30 45 days with new processors memory and hard drives getting bigger </s>
<s> most processors are 2 3 gigaherz hard drives tend to be 30 gigabytes or more and memory is at 256 mb s or more </s>
<s> you ll want to buy a computer with alot of memory like 512 mb s or 1 gigabyte if you are going to do digital video editing </s>
<s> it all depends on what you re going to use the computer for and how much you have to spend on the computer </s>
<s> computers are pretty cheap at 300 500 dollars </s>
<s> i would definitely find a computer with a dvd burner </s>
<s> if i have understood the article my statement is correct i have added the underlines in terms of processor pin count the new socket was not really necessary to support ddr2 memory </s>
<s> however amd decided to make physical modifications in order to prevent people installing the wrong processor into their systems </s>
<s> so socket am2 or m2 as it was called before hitting intellectual property issues has a total of 940 pins </s>
<s> despite this it is also not pin compatible with the opteron s socket 940 the introduction of the socket am2 platform will also change the current cooler specification forcing the cost of a new thermal solution on those socket 754 939 940 folks willing to upgrade </s>
<s> the change does not affect the maximum dimensions of the mounting frame nor the cooler but it redefines the clamping mechanism </s>
<s> this is no issue for the big players system integrators and oems but enthusiasts might have to throw their existing high end cooling solution out of the window </s>
<s> i think you might be confusing different cores including dual core processors which is understandable </s>
<s> the article you gave is almost a year old and as far as i know there were no am2 chips to test yet </s>
<s> like i ve said earlier here s 939 motherboards can be upgraded to take dual core processors by simple bios upgrade </s>
<s> i haven t read every comment so maybe someone has already said this </s>
<s> i d look at the old computer and say what is it about this that i ve outgrown </s>
<s> for me it s often that the hard disk is full and way smaller than what they are now selling </s>
<s> or maybe it s the memory or the graphics capability </s>
<s> once you ve narrowed this down you will know what to look for in a new computer i look for the biggest hard drive i can get </s>
<s> but memory is a big issue with xp bigger than it was before imo </s>
<s> my old desktop computer has 512 mb of ram and that s still enough for most things we do </s>
<s> the laptop that is actually newer has only 256 mb ram and i m often running out of memory </s>
<s> i ll probably upgrade the ram on this laptop and when vista comes out i ll replace the desktop with a computer that has the most ram and the biggest hard drive i can afford </s>
<s> though i have to say i m considering getting a mac </s>
<s> you really might want to look at macs depending on what you do with your computer </s>
<s> i m getting really fed up with microsoft and i wonder if it s not finally time to switch </s>
<s> i m not sure i m techy enough to try to install linux on a computer which is another alternative </s>
<s> i can see two problems with hard drives 1 the bigger the hard drive the more you stand to loose if it fails 2 unless you are super organised and never need to use the search facility you ll find it can take relatively long time find the right file despite faster processors </s>
<s> if you get system built for you ask the system builder to divide the disk into one or more logical drives and save different types of stuff in each for example i have a small logical hdd for operating system and swap file another for programs next one for data and one logical drive for each kid </s>
<s> sure for each partition you loose some of the drive space but these days that s not a problem </s>
<s> my teenage son s computer has only 6gb hdd but he doesn t find this too much of a problem because he has got into a habit of backing up his files on cd roms and uninstalling any program he is not currently using running a reg cleaner afterwards </s>
<s> granted he is not using powerful programs that need huge amount of space but the principal is the same as long as you only keep work in process in the computer you don t really need all that space </s>
<s> how much your minimum need is depends if you are doing video editing or writing letters but its nice to have lots of space nevertheless i have my whole music library several gigabytes worth of image files two computers backed up plus my son s drivers even though they are burned onto a disk or two as well </s>
<s> again you are right about vista needed lots of memory and it is now cheap </s>
<s> but if you only do simple office tasks you should be able to cope less than we are led to believe </s>
<s> i have under 800mb ram of which the onboard graphics and sound takes their share yet i have never run out of memory despite running 3 or 4 programs including image editing one and up to fifteen web pages while listening to music </s>
<s> because my funds are limited i ll buy more memory only if and when i need it </s>
<s> there are some more user friendly versions of linux that self install more or less the os but you are right in that they are still not as easy as windows </s>
<s> more importantly hardware is not as widely supported </s>
<s> what i see in my local pc world mac isn t that well supported either in soft or hardware </s>

<s> unless you just gotta have it waiting at least 6mo after their release can save you big bucks </s>
<s> this coming christmas season should have some hot deals </s>
<s> but if you re just wanting a fast machine now and have the grand to spend now those deals will keep you up to par with what most gaming software manufactures will offer for at least a year </s>
<s> from simply a speed perspective alone yes you would benefit from buying now there is absolutely a benefit anyone with a system of your clock speed will get from the faster cpu hard disk i o speed etc </s>
<s> however you really need to state what you use a computer for and how it serves your needs </s>
<s> then and only then can you tell about what if any new technology will impact your use </s>
<s> for example if all you do is surf the web send some emails run quicken and turbotax type letters with ms word and other typical unspecialized unparticularly demanding applications then no you don t need to spend any money unless you just want a new machine that will be marginally faster at those uses </s>
<s> instead put your money in a 19 quot lcd to make your use more enjoyable </s>
<s> however if you are a gamer and want good graphics or to be able to even play some of the latest games then i d really be surprised you ve waited this long </s>
<s> game players are the most frequent upgraders and usually do so every 1 2 years even if just a new video card </s>
<s> find a good gaming web site that reviews products for gamers to help with your decisions </s>
<s> other than that if you run other particularly demanding applications such as cad video editing conversion music production editing midi wav or any other demanding application then yes by all means upgrade since these areas are where you will see the most significant increase in performance </s>

<s> as far as the tuner card is concerned i wanted to buy a much better one but unfortunately this is the best one available here </s>
<s> i want this computer for gaming play all latest games at decent resolution and also wanna use this as a media center pc </s>
<s> i will be using windows xp with mce 2005 and then switching over to vista when it arrives </s>
<s> ya i know if i were in us i would get a much better computer for this budget </s>
<s> but computer products are expensive here in india </s>
<s> since i will be using my computer for watching recording tv i want a system that doesn t make any noise </s>
<s> can someone here tell me whether the p4 chip or the graphics card make a lot of noise and if so is there any way to reduce it </s>
<s> noise during gameplay is okay though only wanna keep noise down while watching recording tv </s>
<s> this is the first time i am building a new computer please let me know of any combatibility issues or what should be changed </s>
<s> also is it better to build or buy a media center system that can play games </s>
<s> also please state whether this config would be enough for vista </s>
<s> just like you i have a 5 year old pentium iii 600mhz computer which still perform superbly </s>
<s> over the years i have upgraded the operating system from windows 98 2000 then finally to xp </s>

<s> although i m not a game person but i do a lot of graphic designs such as autocad and professional engineering design which require 3d graphics and i am perfectly happy with the performance </s>
<s> as for waiting or buying a new computer now if you decide to wait you will wait for long time and might even be dissapointed in what may come out next </s>
<s> if you fill like purchasing a new computer now go for it because no matter how much game you play what s in the maket today will surely satistfy your desire </s>
<s> i agreed with other person that surggested amd </s>
<s> this is a better product than pentium </s>
<s> i m trying my best to avoid having vista or any new hardware with the quot fritz chip quot on it </s>
<s> i want to get a new pc while i can still buy one without the fritz chip </s>
<s> preferably a build it yourself with a retail version os that belongs to me instead of my hardware vendor dell gateway hp etc so i can upgrade my own motherboard without microsoft disabling my operating system </s>
<s> vista is the next generation of quot big brother quot apps that quot phone home quot and let vendors disable and even delete files from your machine remotely </s>
<s> the new vista machines have complicit hardware such that the hardware itself prevents you from disabling anything that microsoft wants in your pc including a new operating system </s>
<s> i do not want vista on my pc in my home </s>
<s> i don t quot pirate quot anything and don t do music on my pc at all i m 65 but i decidedly wish to own my own pc rather than microsoft and vendors having control of it </s>
<s> i mean really what about its latest drm scheme that opened a hole wide enough to drive a truckload of trojans through </s>
<s> microsoft is turning out to protect vendors at your our expense that s what it s quot trustworthy computing quot means don t get the mistaken idea that it s more quot trustworthy quot for you it isn t it s more trustworthy for vendors including microsoft </s>
<s> the only user friendly thing microsoft has done imho is to move the drivers out of the kernel but that s just correcting one of its original design mistakes </s>
<s> i have protection all around and have never had an unfriendly software invasion so that is not enough reason for me to turn control of my pc over to microsoft and other vendors </s>
<s> so my advice would be to buy a machine while you can still get one that will belong to and can be controled by you instead of microsoft and other vendors </s>

<s> i dream of hot overclockable processor that would allow me to temporarily quot step on the gas quot while doing cpu intensive tasks even if that would mean unstable machine if run more than a few hours </s>
<s> over the last few months i thought about having a file server machine running ftp and having full 100mbps access speed to the hard disk over the network then beside it a portable powerplant such as the one currently in repair but although it may save the cost of a full featured desktop down to a network optimized linux storage machine there aren t as many external peripherals as standard internal ones plus they re usually pricier </s>
<s> for the say the portable is an athlon 64 3000 planned to get a mt 40 512mb planned to up it to 1gb 60 7200 hdd and a dvd dl burner </s>

<s> with so many replys and a whole lot don t have a clue what they re talking about </s>
<s> it must have been a hard choice </s>
<s> but i think you made the right one </s>
<s> i just finished building a system for someone and the specs along with the prices follow </s>
<s> and it s all in canadian dollars so add about 15 to the total for us price </s>
<s> i don t think you overpaid a whole lot for your system or have you bought it yet </s>
<s> to try to answer your new questions might be a little tough as a bit more info is needed but on the surface it looks like it should work for your needs </s>
<s> however it is going to depend on a few things not listed </s>
<s> take a look at what i had to buy </s>
<s> that is what you need to put a system together parts wise </s>
<s> what i built is a slighty above middle of the road system but it really flies </s>
<s> you can research cnet on how to build a computer or better yet take their on line course </s>
<s> or just google for instructions or ask for help like you just did </s>
<s> anyway i agree about your amd choice </s>
<s> it s all i use </s>
<s> i am a bit concerned however with your power supply </s>
<s> it might not be big enough to do all you want </s>
<s> the more devices you add the more power you need </s>
<s> you also did not say if it s a sata or ide drive plus you should have a floppy drive as you may need to download a program to a floppy so that the motherboard will recognize the larger drive it s a windows thing </s>
<s> to answer the noise issue it should be quite quiet </s>
<s> the gaming issue i think is more of a personal one a matter of choice </s>
<s> as far as vista is concerned newer is not always better </s>
<s> i only use xp pro because it was built better for working with media than 98 was </s>
<s> i prefer 98 otherwise i would still have 98 on my main computer </s>
<s> i use 98 on all my others </s>
<s> vista is going to have a tremendous amount of bugs to start off as did all the other releases of windows </s>
<s> i usually wait at lease a year or more to change operating systems if i do </s>
<s> anyway go over my list of what i had to buy to build a computer and if you want or need more help building it just post a message or you can e mail me direct see my profile </s>

<s> i like pro because i have found it to be very stable for a windows product and i have heard that m ft will soon be ending support for xp home </s>
<s> i guess they don t want to anger corporate customers </s>
<s> of course any new computer you order from dell or other major box maker includes xp home </s>
<s> you must pay a substantial amount to upgrade to pro </s>
<s> i have no psysic powers but i visualize vista mista </s>
<s> which is coming out at least a year later than we were led to believe will be majorly imperfect </s>
<s> the fact that we will initially see the os in both a 32 and 64 bit flavor will not help at all </s>

<s> and that s all i m going to say about that </s>
<s> so noisy that people on the phone believed i was drying my hair at the same time </s>
<s> that fan kept my machine ice cold whatever i threw at it </s>
<s> the noise didn t bother me as long as i was just using it for work it actually helped me to concentrate by blocking all other noises of the house and outdoors </s>
<s> but when i started to use it for other things i ended up putting the base unit into the attic next door </s>

<s> not everyone has an attic only a few feet from the computer but maybe you ll find a large cupboard need space around for ventilation </s>

<s> not an ideal solution i know but it s cheap way of doing it untill you can afford the more expenive hardware solution </s>
