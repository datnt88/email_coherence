<s> i have a pretty good computer right now but i feel that there are some problem spots that need to be looked at </s>
<s> specs ati 4870hd intel e6750 2 66ghz 4mb cashe g skill 8g s ram western digital hd s asus p5k se 600w powersupply i have about 250 dollars to spend right now and i was really looking to upgrade my e6750 because it might be bottlenecking my graphics card </s>
<s> what im having problems with is what to do with that money </s>
<s> from what i know most games dont have quad core support but with technology idk how long that will last </s>
<s> so my question is what should i do with that money </s>
<s> stick with a good dual core like a e8500 or go to a quad core </s>
<s> im going to have to stick to my lga 775 socket </s>
<s> one </s>
<s> that way you would have a high performance peripheral to carry forward to a new system when the time arises there s not much gain or future in getting another socket 775 vapcmd </s>
<s> if that was the case what should i get for a graphics card then </s>
<s> i was leaning towards nvidea because of the performance in games and ive had problems with my ati </s>
<s> have you been able to overcome the problems </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> ati just has never been good for me in general its more of a preference to use nvidea </s>
<s> ive had many nvidea card and they all functioned perfectly for me </s>
<s> the 4870 was my first ati and its just missing something that i like from nvidea </s>
<s> ive been looking at the gtx 200 series but i really dont know what the prices will look like in a few months with the 300 series coming out </s>
<s> or the ones from amd ati </s>
<s> another thought </s>
<s> skip the l775 cpu and use the for a socket 1366 or 1156 mb which gives you a platform for more cpu power and the option to use crossfire or sli plus usb 3 0 and sata 3 vapcmd </s>
