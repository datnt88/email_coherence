<s> i am running windows xp with service pack 2 and i am installing ati catalyst 5 3 the latest version my card is quot ati radeon 9000 quot recently in the middle of the games the system reboots i tried more than ane game but all are the same after 15 to 30 mins of the game the machine reboots and my processor s fan is working fine this issue doesn t happen at all at applications except games that s why i believe it s a driver issue the games i tried are c c generals nhl 2005 and fifa 2005 </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> thanx in advance </s>
<s> but it sounds a lot like an overheat issue </s>
<s> did you install the graphics card recently or just update the drivers </s>
<s> even if the fan works it could still be heating up from the increased load </s>
<s> i guess so but this is a new issue if it was heating it would have occured long time ago i bought this card 2 years ago and it worked fine until now </s>
<s> i would suggest reinstalling the drivers just in case something went wrong on the install </s>
<s> also if it works install an older version of the driver </s>
<s> thats probably not the best solution but it s a workaround at least </s>
<s> trust me it s not a driver issue </s>
<s> the problem lies somewhere else in the computer not your graphics card </s>
<s> games and other very large applications tend to use a lot of memory and will crush if you don t have enough ram </s>
<s> when a gpu overheats you start seeing artifacts </s>
<s> it won t prompt the computer to restart immediately </s>
