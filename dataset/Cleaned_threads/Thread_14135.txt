<s> i have a 3 month old athlon 64 machine equipped with a toshiba d l dvd burner </s>
<s> i have a spindle of 25 brand new verbatim dvd r w blanks that i ve been successfully converting and burning some avi movies on with the nero suite </s>
<s> i d now like to dump some older viewed movies and reuse the disks </s>
<s> i have tried on about 10 of them to just plain flat re record over some of them </s>
<s> nero reports read errors on most and on a few i get no error report everything says ok but my set top player refuses to play them check disk for errors </s>
<s> i then tried to erase the disks and start the whole process over </s>
<s> again on trying to erase them i ran up against a few read errors but mainly the remaining disks seem useless after erasing them as nero gives me a variety of errors when i attempt to re record material on them </s>
<s> example the disk is not empty or the disk is full and can t be written to </s>
<s> often times explorer will invite me to insert a disk when i just did </s>
<s> is there material on these re recorded disks </s>
<s> nope i can t tell neither the drive in the computer nor the set top player will play them </s>
<s> windows explorer seems to indicate they re blank cds not dvds </s>
<s> so ok why am i worried about a few measely disks </s>
<s> basically it s not a few disks to me when the whole spindle now seems to be ready for the dumpster </s>
<s> i don t want to waste more time and money nor proceed further until i m sure that they are in fact toast and that i completely ensure i understand what i m doing </s>
<s> i have also tried alcohol 120 to erase these same deal </s>
<s> nero just barfs when i try to re record </s>
<s> remember i did say i tried to just record over them too </s>
<s> i have also tried windows xp s own packet writing routines with the same results </s>
<s> i even borrowed a copy of nero 7 0 ultra with the same results </s>
<s> i thought highly of verbatim products </s>
<s> i was pretty confident the r w was the way to travel </s>
<s> i thought the toshiba drive was a good find </s>
<s> i know my aspi layer is current and i m reasonably comfortable that the hardware and nero alcohol 120 software is fine </s>
<s> i m pretty sure this is due to quot pilot error quot what s the scoop on being able to re record and thus re use dvd r w disks </s>
<s> is it possible and what s the correct procedure or sequence of events to follow so that i can re use them </s>
<s> thank you group </s>
<s> quot windows xp does not support packet writing quot it s possible your drive has new firmware available but the details are not in your post for me to look it up with ease </s>
<s> also i don t use any aspi layer </s>
<s> i can t guess why we needed that </s>
<s> cheers bob </s>
<s> thanks bob for the reply </s>
<s> ok i see my mistake one of mis stating the fact </s>
<s> rather than say quot packet writing quot i should have said quot windows own native dvd handling technique via explorer quot </s>
<s> so there s not packet writing in xp pro well and done whatever xp has for a protocol it fails to do what i think it should do that is erase the disk so i can re use it </s>
<s> to quickly summarize i m just trying to re write over the material originally recorded </s>
<s> i tried just re recording over the old movies and some mistakes i made on some disks with nero </s>
<s> it failed </s>
<s> i tried first erasing the recorded disks that didn t work </s>
<s> the firmware on the toshiba combo drive was and is the latest according to the toshiba site </s>
<s> several weeks ago nero s infotool reported that my aspi layer was out of date and i figured that might have something to do with this so i dutifully updated it </s>
<s> even after that i was still unable to get the results i think i m supposed to get to re use the dvd r w disks </s>
<s> and just maybe that s what my problem is i expect to be able to re use these and i can t because of some limitation i m unaware of </s>
<s> but then i think quot why would they call them rewritables r w if weren t designed so quot i believe you should be able to re write over these correct </s>
<s> and if so i ve only recorded on them once maybe twice on a few at the most </s>
<s> so i don t think they re bad necessarily </s>
<s> so why is this process not able to work for me </s>
<s> again i figure it s got to be some step i m missing </s>
<s> does that help </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> xp has no protocol for this at all </s>
<s> let me share that aspi layers are something i eschewed years ago in favor of the new ways </s>
<s> you must have installed items not listed </s>
<s> but it matters not as i ll just share a free tool i use to erase and do most of what i need to do with both cdr w and dvdr w media </s>
<s> look up cdburnerxp at download com bob </s>
