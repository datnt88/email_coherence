<s> lexmark x5150 warranty recently expired for this all in one </s>

<s> hmm doesnt sound nice </s>
<s> i know you may not be happy with the results </s>
<s> however at this point i can only imagine that the contacts on the printer is defective </s>
<s> the problem cannot be fixed </s>
<s> if you have ever used a refilled cartridge please do not do so because that will damage the contacts on the printer </s>
<s> if you ask how </s>
<s> lexmark cartridges are gel based water soluble inks manufactured with high atmospheric pressure </s>
<s> refilling the cartridge will equalize pressure inside the cartridge with that of the atmosphere </s>
<s> in the long run this will seriously damage the contacts </s>
<s> for a common man this explaination always does not satisfy </s>
<s> but for a product designer it really makes sense </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> what might have caused this quot damage quot is interesting because it wasn t refilled cartridges </s>
<s> i used brand new ones </s>
<s> i used the printer infrequently but that shouldn t have changed the color control </s>
