<s> i hope this is something common ive just finished building my first pc ive followed all the wiring diagrams and intructions in all my intruction books but this keeps happening </s>
<s> i plug the power lead in the back of the compter and get a red led on the motherboard which the intsructions say that the motherboard is recieving power i then turn the power button on and get a green led and the fans start up but a second after the computer turns off leaving me with the red led again ive disconnected everything three times now and follewed the instructions each time but the problem keeps coming up does this ring any bells with anyone </s>
<s> thanks for your time leon </s>
<s> have an automatic shut down to protect the cpu if it s not seated properly or the hsf isn t protecting it enough and it overheats usually due to the thermal paste or sticky thing isn t enough too much forgotten about or if the fan wasn t mounted properly on top of the cpu </s>
<s> i would check there before anywhere else </s>

<s> if you have an athlonxp or sempron for socket a or pentium 3 and are using a tim not a pad ensure that the tim is only the die the reflective purple ish thing in the middle of the chip and not touching any of the bridges basically if it s not isolated to that part and it touches contacts on the chip it can cause issues </s>
<s> that the 5 volt standby voltage is applied to the mobo </s>
<s> this is what you need for the front power switch to be able to turn the system on </s>
<s> the main 5 volts the 12 volts and the 3 3 volts </s>
<s> you may have made the mistake of assembling the entire system before doing an absolute minimal assembly to check that the power supply turns on properly </s>
<s> if you would like to troubleshoot remove disconnect everything except the ps to mobo connectors should be two in the newer mobos the 20 pin or 24 opin and the 4 pin 12 volt connector that powers the cpu </s>
<s> one stick of memory the front panel connections to the mobo hopefully with a speaker the cpu and its hsf plugged in </s>
<s> no cards no floppy no mouse no keyboard </s>
<s> at this point you if the power supply is plugged in the red led on you should be able to hit the front power switch and the supply should turn on and stay on simply turn it off again by hitting the power switch again sometimes you may have to holsd it depressed for up to five seconds </s>
<s> if you can t get this far don t waste time on anything else </s>
<s> it ain quot t gonna get better by adding anything </s>
<s> still have the problem </s>
<s> maybe the mobo is shorting to the baseplate due to incorrect installation </s>
<s> keep us posted </s>
