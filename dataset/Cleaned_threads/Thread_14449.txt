<s> well my son built a nice machine </s>
<s> he had problems with a seagate 250 gb sata cuda drive crashing twice a total meltdown </s>
<s> he ended having to reformat and reinstall winxp but lost all data </s>
<s> so sent him another drive a wd 250 gb sata drive </s>
<s> he set them up as raid 1 i thought his data woudl be quot protected quot </s>
<s> he is in college and doesn t really have the time or energy to trouble shoot so i m trying to help him out </s>
<s> yesterday his drives crashed again as he typed on it </s>
<s> well both drives were totally unreadable </s>
<s> no dir both drives </s>
<s> both registered as quot unformated quot i thought it was the seagate but now i m not sure </s>
<s> if it was just the seagate why would both drives in raid 1 crash at the same time </s>
<s> very odd and very frustrating </s>
<s> i bought him an external onetouch drive for backup reformatted and reinstalled xp again </s>
<s> this time we are using the wd as the boot drive </s>
<s> i also disabled raid </s>
<s> i ordered a seagate hd replacement but i m not really sure if it is the hd at all the mother board the sata drivers xp glich or what </s>
<s> i know this is difficult question but perhaps someone out there had a similar problem </s>
<s> any grey cell electrical energy you can throw my way will be appreciated </s>
<s> help </s>

<s> raid level 1 disk mirroring or duplexing would do just that </s>
<s> any error on the main drive will faithfully be copied onto the other drive </s>
<s> i ve been at this for 2 decades plus and never found raid 1 to save anyone time money or data </s>
<s> go figure </s>
<s> maybe next time something simply such as using one drive as a normal drive then use acronis or such to save a copy of the os plus everything to the second drive as you see fit </s>
<s> at least you have a copy that should not corrupt when the first drive and its os messes up </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> in so many areas however i disagree with this post </s>
<s> the statement that any error on the main drive will faithfully be copied onto the other drive is not correct for a true raid 1 configuration </s>
<s> first there is not really a main drive the two drives are essentially peers </s>
<s> second data are not normally copied from one drive to the other data are written simultaneously to both drives from the original source </s>
<s> if an error appears on both drives the fault is likely in the software hardware preparing the data for writing including a possible problem in the raid controller if the error is on only one drive it could be a bad disk sector a disk writing error or a raid controller error </s>
<s> i don t know perhaps there is some system likely software driven that does write to one drive and then copies it to another </s>
<s> however this is not a true raid configuration which is hardware driven but merely a software emulation </s>
<s> this certainly isfeasable it would be cheaper and it sounds like what you describe </s>
<s> but it is not true raid </s>
<s> raid has been in general use for only about 15 years about a third of my time with computers </s>
<s> during that time i have seen several instances where raid did save time data and therefore money </s>
<s> the most recent was early this year when we had a disk error on our old local server </s>
<s> fortunately it was not a real disk crash just a write error </s>
<s> i was able to restore the data on the bad drive from the good drive this is where copying is used in a matter of minutes </s>
<s> had the error occured on a single drive it might have taken me hours especially since the novell os is on these drives </s>
<s> so you go figure </s>
<s> of course this incident didn t save anyone money i am a volunteer so my time cost is zero </s>
<s> if raid were as useless as you imply why do almost all servers use some raid configuration </s>
<s> most new servers have hot swappable drives so that in the event of a total disk crash a new drive can be popped in data copied to it and the system back in operation in a very short time </s>
<s> i have raid 1 for important data on my main system at home </s>
<s> true it may never save me any time mainly because i am in my eighties and quite possibly will not make it until a bad problem occurs </s>
<s> however having it makes me feel a little more secure in case of an early failure or a late death and i consider the roughly 150 i have invested in it to be well worth while </s>
<s> frank </s>
<s> you ve repeated the exact reason why raid 1 rarely saves the day </s>
<s> quot first there is not really a main drive the two drives are essentially peers </s>
<s> second data are not normally copied from one drive to the other data are written simultaneously to both drives from the original source quot bingo </s>
<s> two corrupted drives for the price of one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you say bingo </s>
<s> two corrupted drives for the price of one </s>
<s> only in certain cases which i pointed out but not the majority of the time </s>
<s> and the corruption is to the same data no differeence than had that data been on a single drive and no difference in recovering it </s>
<s> as i said if the data is corrupted before the write process it naturally will be corrupt on both drives </s>
<s> however if an error occurs during the actual process of writing to a drive and you know this does sometimes happen the data will be corrupt only on that drive but not on the other one </s>
<s> i cited as an example this very thing happening to me earlier this year on our server </s>
<s> another important aspect of raid 1 is the protection in event of a complete disk failure perhaps a menchanical crash or a fried circuit board this almost always involves only one drive of the pair </s>
<s> now instead of sending your one drive off for data recovery at a cost of several hundred dollars you simply install the new drive restore from the mirror and you are back in business in a short time </s>
<s> you may say that you can accomplish this with acronis true image norton ghost or some other software </s>
<s> true but you must make an effort to do it and there is a lag in data of hours or days depending on your schedule of backups </s>
<s> i am not saying you do not need separate backups if you have raid you most certainly do </s>
<s> you need the protection in case both drives become corrupt or inoperable perhaps a direct lightning strike a fire or some other disaster and you do need off site storage for important data </s>
<s> but when only one of the drives fails the more common situation it generally is much faster and easier to restore the system from a raid mirror than from a drive image on some other media and it also is up to the minute </s>
<s> you are never worse off with raid 1 configuration than with a single drive and you may be much better off in event of a disaster </s>
<s> but as you said it is your data and your call </s>
<s> if you don t want the extra protection and convenience so be it no one will force it on you </s>
<s> nuff said frank </s>
<s> how can i guess this one </s>
<s> it s been 20 years plus of too many tales of sorrow yet raid 1 never paid off </s>
<s> gt you can write all you want but time after time i have to help people recover from disasters where this setup does not payoff </s>
<s> yes i read your post </s>
<s> now let s talk reality </s>
