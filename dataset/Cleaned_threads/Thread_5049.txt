<s> think i ve boiled it down to these two for the upgrade of my dell c521 with 4gb 32 bit 280 watt any ideas it s for tv wacthing and gaming gta4 oblivion far cry2 thanks again for the help </s>
<s> ok those are two of the best cards around </s>
<s> i personally have a geforce 9800 512 mb and it runs great i play codwaw simcity socitites age of empires iii and many other graphic heavy games and i can run all my games on max quality with no lag </s>
<s> mind you that i custom build my machine and i run 64 bit windows 7 rc however i think that the geforce 9500 1 gb card might be better because it has more dedicated graphics memory and it should be able to play games for many more years to come </s>
<s> the 9800 is the winner here </s>
<s> it may need a big power supply but given these 2 choices the gamer should pick the 9800 again </s>
<s> that power supply will have to be upgraded </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> shouldn t the 9500 1 gb card be better as it has more dedicated graphics memory than the 9800 512 mb card </s>
<s> just a thought </s>
<s> also he is right on the power supply it will probably need to be upgraded also but their not that expensive </s>
<s> you can research this at tomshardware com </s>
<s> but either should be too taxing for the 280 watt power supply </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> both cards are pretty good however from the info on tigerdirect com the 9800 card is much better </s>
<s> however with that said it is about 50 bucks us more </s>
<s> read the info below </s>
<s> geforce 9500 gt 1 gb geforce 9800 gtx 512 mb </s>
