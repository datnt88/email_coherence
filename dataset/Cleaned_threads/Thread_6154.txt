<s> i upgraded my computer about an hour ago by installing a zotac gtx 650 ti drivers were installed correctly and a a rosewill rd600 stallion series psu </s>
<s> computer worked as it is supposed to for a good 30 minutes </s>
<s> however when i entered a second game to test settings my computer completely crashed </s>
<s> no bluescreen or anything it just instantly shut off </s>
<s> now when i simply turn the psu on my system makes the first sound it normally does when it boots but then the cpu fan turns on to full blast </s>
<s> no follow on beeps just the cpu fan running full speed </s>
<s> i have never heard it this loud before </s>
<s> i do not get any video output to my monitor and the led on the power button of my case doesn t even light up as if the computer isn t even turned on </s>
<s> i upgraded this factory model from gateway dx4840 03e the specs for this system are 1 tb hdd intel i3 540 cpu running at 3 1 ghz 8 gb ram thanks in advance for the help </s>
<s> when this happens i unplug the new video card psu and go back </s>
<s> that way i can see if the original gear is still ok also you can get out your volt meter and check the cmos battery </s>
<s> you want to read 3 or a little more volts </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> ok when i go back what can i do if it doesn t run well </s>
<s> is there any way to salvage it from there </s>
<s> go back to the old power supply and video card if that works replace the p s first and i suspect it won t work </s>
<s> the fan on the cpu comes on fast at first but should be reduced quickly when the bios loads otherwise it will run at full speed </s>
<s> this tells me the 5 volts has failed but the 12 volts is okay </s>
<s> but i hope you won t be upset as it s the same as fixing any pc </s>
<s> find or guess the failed part replace that </s>
<s> which is it </s>
<s> if you knew each time you ve make a small fortune </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the problem was the power supply as mjd420nova suggested </s>
<s> i m not sure why </s>
<s> i did find this psu that is meant specifically for my model computer </s>
<s> would you recommend buying this </s>
<s> the only reason i m asking is because i m skeptical about any other psu working with my mobo </s>
<s> was the one i just bought an isolated case </s>
<s> it didn t look like a bad choice with it being single rail to avoid you learning about all that </s>
<s> next time add 100 more watts </s>
<s> more power arr arr arr </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> that was right </s>
<s> so was that an isolated incident with only that psu or will my computer reject every new one i try to install for instance this </s>
<s> sorry but can you explain to me what single rail means </s>
<s> a single 12v rail means you don t need to check into if one or more rails could be overtaxed by your gpu or other choices </s>
<s> you also don t have to take care for run the one rail to your gpu then the others to drives and such </s>
<s> that s called balancing the rails well discussed and most folk burst into flames when they find out about this </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> how can you tell if a psu is single or multi rail </s>
<s> unless it says it somewhere in the product description and i missed it </s>
<s> look at the output ratings and if it s a single 12v rail you see one ampere rating for the lone 12v </s>
<s> if more you see them tell you the rating for each rail </s>
<s> bob </s>
