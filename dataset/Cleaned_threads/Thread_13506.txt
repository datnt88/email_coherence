<s> i am going to be setting up a wireless network for my daughter with 3 computers </s>
<s> qwest will be supplying a dsl modem with a wireless router </s>
<s> the first computer will be connected to the computer with a cat 5e patch cord </s>
<s> there will also be a laptop and a desktop with wireless connection </s>
<s> my question is can the two wireless computers be configured to use the printer that will be hooked up to the wired computer </s>
<s> i have done printer sharing before but all computers were hard wired to the router and a network port on the printer </s>
<s> can it be done </s>
<s> and if so how do i set the computers up </s>

<s> in addition to the set up described in the previous message for the quot client quot computer you first need to make sure the printer is shared start gt printers faxes gt right click on printer to be shared select quot sharing quot </s>
<s> you may also need to check to make sure all computers are members of the same workgroup in order to share resources right click on quot my computer quot select quot properties quot then click on the quot computer name quot tab </s>
<s> click on the quot change quot button if you need to change the workgroup name </s>
<s> you ll need to restart the computer for the change to take effect </s>

<s> i will let you know how things went when i get back </s>
<s> thank you both very much for the advise </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> i tried the previous suggestions and my laptop does not see the printer </s>
<s> the printer connected to the other computer is quot shared quot and we are on the same working group </s>
<s> any other ideas </s>

<s> please let us know </s>
<s> the computer my printer is installed on has zonealarm </s>
<s> i m not sure if i need to turn it off and if so how </s>
<s> the windows xp firewall for printers is turned off on both </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i m running zonealarm as well on both the quot host quot computer and quot client quot and can access the shared printer without a problem </s>
<s> you may want to try turning off za briefly on the client computer and trying to access to see if it makes a difference </s>
<s> you can turn off za by right clicking on the za icon in the system tray and selecting quot shutdown za quot you may also want to check to make sure your home wireless network is in the trusted zone double click on the za icon in the system tray click on the quot firewall quot tab button on the left side of the za panel then click on the quot zones quot tab </s>
<s> go to start settings network connections right click on the connection for the host pc click properties go to the last tab and enable file and printer sharing it should be the firewall tab you may need to restart the system </s>
<s> ps you have to to this to all pc s </s>
<s> you can also access this feature from the windows firewall </s>
<s> thanks i got it working </s>
<s> i just got back from my daughters and the wireless network and printing is working great with the help of all the advise i got here </s>
<s> the only thing different is i had to load the printer software on to each of the wireless laptops before it would work </s>
<s> thanks to all </s>
<s> wayne </s>
<s> question are your ip addresses allocated dynamically or are they static </s>
<s> i m wondering how the printer could be found on the network if the ip address changes everytime the dsl connection is cycled for dynamic allocated addresses </s>
<s> my dsl provider does dynamic allocation </s>
