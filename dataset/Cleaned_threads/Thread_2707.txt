<s> the last week or so our internet connection has been off and on </s>
<s> the lights on the modem report no internet connection then sometimes 10 sometimes 30 minutes later all is well </s>
<s> i don t know if this is charter cable or my modem </s>
<s> we do not have tv or a second hookup so i can t just unplug the modem and then try another hookup </s>
<s> the modem is 5 years old motorola surfboard 5100 </s>
<s> unfortunately we have voip phone service so i can t call charter when this is down </s>
<s> i have called them before and i ve always gotten the quot there s nothing wrong with our connection quot answer again when the internet connection is running of course its working properly </s>
<s> is there any diagnostic i can run to determine if the problem is an old modem or my isp </s>
<s> i can always get another modem and plug it in then re sell it on amazon if the new modem isn t any better off but i d lose 20 30 bucks in the exchange </s>
<s> i d like to try something else first </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i learned this long ago </s>
<s> use their cable modem even if it s 1 50 a month </s>
<s> their unit is their problem and the unit my cableco works for over 8 hours after the power goes out </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if its too much trouble for even you yeah charter told me it would cost an extra 2 bucks mo and i ve more than made up for the price of the modem 80 or so iirc by avoiding that fee over the 5 years of service </s>
<s> of course i m experiencing the drawbacks of my strategy now anyways hopefully someone can come up with some magical way software utility that can help me see if my modem is working right </s>
<s> i just got an idea perhaps the issue is my modem overheating that might explain why the outages are intermittent and this is the end of july live in desert region </s>
<s> is there any way to detect the temperature of my modem apart from dunking it into a bucket of water then sticking a thermometer in the water </s>
<s> if in fact this is being caused by overheating this problem would not be solved by getting a new modem at least not solved over the long run </s>
<s> i have siw system information for windows a nice utility that gives a ton of system information even keys for ms products but it didn t have this information </s>
<s> i ve had my modem in an enclosed space standing right next to the back of the desktop unit which would be providing a rather warm environment </s>
<s> anyways i ll put it in an open space tonight and then see if these problems continue over the next few days </s>
<s> here local thrift shops have used broadband modems of all kinds </s>
<s> if your local area it should be also depending on town city </s>
<s> its worth the try </s>
<s> since you mentioned thi is a 5yr </s>
<s> old box yeah maybe its suffering the effects of wear tear so a used modem is worth the swap we re talking well under 10 </s>
<s> also a friend with a cell phone certainly would be a friend if borrowed to call during an outage </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> want to check for oxidiazation of the cable pins at both ends or else the loose ness of the fittings </s>
<s> how old is the cable line itself </s>
<s> how about the adapter point </s>
<s> is it still the same or has been upgraded by the provider </s>
<s> if you have a spare cable lying around you could try swapping it </s>
<s> its been a day and a half since i shifted the modem to a more ventilated place and it hasn t gone offline yet </s>
<s> i ll have to give it a few more days to be sure but if this remains the case i won t need to worry about any other troubleshooting </s>
<s> after three full days of no outages after moving it to a ventilated location yesterday afternoon three times it went out briefly about 10 minutes at a time </s>
<s> i was just about thinking that this was taken care of ok i ll just see how this goes for another few days </s>
<s> like i said i have little faith in charter s tech support telling me anything but quot the line is clear from our end quot that s all i ve ever heard from them in the past as well as aol in the early years of internet if i can live with a short spell of outages i ll just bite the bullet if it gets too annoying i ll get a replacement model and see if that won t do the trick </s>
