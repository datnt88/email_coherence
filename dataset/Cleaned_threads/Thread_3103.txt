<s> firstly i apologize if this is the wrong place </s>
<s> my question is what is the equivalent of motherboard in the older generation computers like the 1st gen computers </s>
<s> i heard it was vacuum tubes </s>
<s> if so i would like to know how they performed the function of a motherboard </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> if you looked at very early computers that used tubes they often had a rudimentary backplane </s>
<s> later these advanced to such as the vmebus and for the personal computers the s 100 was very common </s>
<s> with the apple 1 you see the beginnings of the motherboard where the computer was small enough to be put directly on the backplane </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> there were no mtrbds </s>
<s> in the tube era </s>
<s> if anything these were dedicated devices etc </s>
<s> that did a task in out or to process </s>
<s> those computers that were mechanical and or before anything transistors were mostly in the 50 60 s era </s>
<s> there were modules at best or wirewrap to include backplanes black boxes or pcb s mounted on busses which are concidered backplanes </s>
<s> also tubes found on older computers may have been power related rather than logic </s>
<s> google for computer museums even wwii era ultra enigma decoders </s>
<s> however don t confuse analog computers to what was the 1st electrical or non mechanical type computers </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
