<s> hi we ve just got a new macbook and have been trying for days to get it to connect to our router </s>
<s> here are the details it s a netgear dg834gv3 with the latest v4 01 40 firmware </s>
<s> we ve tried amongst others wpa psk with a network key composed of 19 letters numbers </s>
<s> we ve tried broadcasting it on channels 09 11 and 06 </s>
<s> quot enable wireless access point quot quot allow broadcast of name ssid quot are checked and quot wireless isolation quot is unchecked </s>
<s> it is set to mode quot g b quot </s>
<s> the wireless station access list is turned off so anyone can join the network provided they have the passphrase </s>
<s> the macbook is the latest 2 1 ghz intel core 2 duo with os x 10 5 6 it has been serviced </s>
<s> the macbook will connect to other wireless networks and our netgear will connect to all our other devises but not the macbook </s>
<s> it insists that the password is invalid when we select our network either that or it just says quot connection timeout quot </s>
<s> we ve tried disabling the netgear security altogether but the macbook just asks for a wep password </s>
<s> please can anyone help us </s>
<s> i have no idea why it won t connect </s>
<s> why i ask is someone did that and promptly began asking questions not unlike yours </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> there is no firewall set on the macbook that i know of </s>
<s> the security settings preference pane is set to quot allow all incoming connections quot </s>
<s> also try our mac os forum since we have someone that is very apple there </s>
<s> sadly i d call the router maker and lodge your complaint fast </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> but sadly that s not an option netgear have nightmare callcentres indian phone operators premium call costs long holds making one set up an account so that they can send you promotional e mails the works </s>
<s> i think it would cost more than the price of the router </s>
<s> my calls have been not so bad </s>
<s> here everything works fine but i don t have that model of router </s>
<s> shame </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> this is a regular complaint but the upside is that their user forum at has to be pretty good and one of the moderators uses macs </s>
<s> incidentally i ve had problems connecting a friend s mac laptop and desktop to two different routers zoom 802 11b d link 802 11g </s>
<s> the laptop would connect to the zoom but not the dlink and the desktop would only connect to the dlink </s>
<s> maybe something to do with wep vs wpa we spent a week on this and gave up on the laptop </s>
<s> i suspect apple want you to buy their router </s>
<s> oh my god i may actually have the answer to this one one of the 7 signs i think </s>
<s> i recently set up a netgear wireless with my macbook and was having the same issue i was told to set the vpi to 0 zero vci to 32 bam it was working </s>
<s> just a thought </s>
<s> hope this is right </s>
<s> cjg </s>
<s> i haven t tried connecting the macbook to it but when i applied your settings the computer the netgear is wired to could not load any web pages </s>
<s> the original setting are multiplexing method vc based vpi 0 vci 38 dsl mode auto multi mode are these alright </s>
<s> i have a similar issue with an ibook g3 not connecting or accepting my wpa password for my wireless network </s>
<s> all other computers in my home accept it but this one and i have other macs </s>
<s> i am not familiar with vpi vci could you be a little clearer for me and walk me through what you are suggesting so i can try to fix </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> like i said it was kind of a miracle that i had that much of an answer i think it will take a call to netgear to get you the rest of the way sorry </s>
<s> problem seemed familiar so tossed out what solved it for me </s>
<s> cjg </s>
