<s> i m about to buy a new videocard </s>
<s> with my budget i ve decided on a sapphire built ati radeon 9600xt 256mb </s>
<s> can anyone offer any advice here does anyone who has this card recommend it or want to slag it off </s>
<s> i ve got about 120 to spend </s>
<s> the system i m using is an asus a7v600 thoroughbred 2400 xp 266fsb with 256mb of ddr ram although this will increase to 512 in the next couple of days </s>
<s> any help is apreciated </s>
<s> imagine the person who changes from one model to another and sees zero payoff </s>
<s> it happens too often </s>
<s> has video card benchmarks which from memory included the 5600 but without knowing what you have now it s unclear whether its worth changing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well thats a good card </s>
<s> but to me your front isde bus is low </s>
<s> but yeah its a good card </s>
<s> and you need like 1gig of ram </s>
<s> it s a geoforce 4 mx 440 so i m anticipating i ll notice the difference </s>
<s> thanks for the link btw </s>
<s> john </s>
<s> the increase in power demands is enough to be sure your machine has the right power as well </s>
<s> read </s>
<s> i agree make sure you have enough power </s>
<s> also make sure that the psu you buy if you buy one is not one of those cheapos </s>
<s> brand names are desired when looking for a psu antec thermaltake pc power cooling and sparkle just to name a few </s>
<s> you should be looking at ones above the 40 especially when going for a psu of 350w or more </s>
<s> the girlfriend is getting me a psu for my birthday so i should be sweet probably about a 450w </s>
<s> that should do the job as i ve got another hd i want to put in and there are 6 fans in my case so it does need quite alot of power </s>
<s> i ve also checked tomshardware and i think i m gonna spend another 30 and get the 9800 pro 128mb it seems to out perform the 9600xt in all of the benchmarks and the price difference isn t too substancial </s>
<s> thanks to everyone who s offered advice on this </s>
