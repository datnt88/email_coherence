<s> i have an 80gb usb iomega hd hard drive attached to a windows xp desktop </s>
<s> i purchased the iomega in part because i really liked the iomega backup program automated worked in the background reliable </s>
<s> i have no trouble transferring files to and from the hard drive </s>
<s> but the iomega backup software works once maybe twice and then gives an quot error starting backup quot message </s>
<s> sometimes going to the control panel and using repair program works </s>
<s> but more often it doesn t </s>
<s> this is not what i d call hassle free backup </s>
<s> does anyone know what might be going wrong </s>
<s> i m running zonealarm and avg as well as adaware could there be a conflict with one of those or is the iomega backup software just problematic </s>
<s> quot is the iomega backup software just problematic </s>
<s> quot i ve yet to encounter non problematic backup software </s>
<s> it s always quot something quot </s>
<s> as it is that way i ve developed my own backup methods such as written at this is not an iomega backup web site but just a general discussion forum so all we can do is share our experiences and if we are lucky find a cure for such issues </s>
<s> if you feel that the iomega software is buggy or needs fixing then the only place to go is where you suspect </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the iomega site is naturally the first place i checked </s>
<s> the quot support quot offered there is nominal and they definitely aren t making it easy for customers to get in touch with them </s>
<s> i like your backup method it s similar to what i ve been doing since iomega backup has been misbehaving </s>
<s> it would make life easier though to find a program that would synchronize a specific catalog of files with the backup folder </s>
<s> i have a list of about 15 folders and several individual files that need to be backed up frequently and selecting them individually is a pain </s>
<s> it can ease such a system bob </s>
