<s> i replaced the power supply in my computer </s>
<s> everything seemed good but when i plug a thumb drive into either usb port on the front they don t work and worse they disable the mouse and keyboard so i have to do a hard shutdown </s>
<s> rebooting re enables the mouse and keyboard until i try the front ports again </s>
<s> what have i done wrong </s>
<s> i found this video and it fixed the problem immediately </s>
<s> quick easy fix </s>
<s> hope it helps rosalynd doneghy </s>
<s> if everything worked before then properly replacing the psu shouldn t have caused a problem </s>
<s> what i suspect is that either your mis routed the usb harness or it became unseated misaligned </s>
<s> inspect and verify your past work and don t take anything for granted </s>
<s> if in fact you did mis route the harness the damage may already be done and that usb hub is hosed </s>
<s> that s a physical damage item though not seen it s damaged </s>
<s> if you want to return usb access install pci card of usb with an int </s>
<s> mounting for usb access for the frt i exclude any s w issues but again i find it hard to believe that the frt </s>
<s> usb ports got whacked and not any other usb ports </s>
<s> the reason the frt </s>
<s> ports cause remaining usb issues it that the usb calls for service become bogged down and aren t released fast enough imo </s>
<s> again related to possible hosed usb hub </s>
<s> follow the frt </s>
<s> usb harness and reset the harness fully several times </s>
<s> if the problem persists then damaged hub </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> willy thank you so much for your help and rosalynd s </s>
<s> i opened the case followed all wires from the front usb ports and made sure all connections were firmly seated </s>
<s> it didn t feel like anything moved but i am pleased to say the front ports now work </s>
<s> thank you again for your replies </s>
<s> joan </s>
<s> thank you for your sharing </s>
<s> i learn much from it </s>
