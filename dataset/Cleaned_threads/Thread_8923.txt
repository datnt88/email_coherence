<s> i have an ide configured sata hdd with windows 7 currently running on it </s>
<s> wd caviar 500gb i have a twin for this disk currently not installed </s>
<s> i would like to if possible configure these two disks so that it registers in windows as a single disk 1tb with one drive letter </s>
<s> any help or pointers is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> create an image of the disk with your operating system and software </s>
<s> use the imaging software of your choice to do this </s>
<s> make at least two copies on two different drives </s>
<s> next install the two 500gb disks on raid enabled ports and create the raid 0 array </s>
<s> all data will be lost on both drives during this process </s>
<s> when that is completed restore the image to the raid array </s>
<s> windows should see it as one drive </s>
<s> with a little luck windows will be happy </s>
<s> what you d want to do beforehand however is to enable raid for the ports you plan to use and make sure drivers are installed </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> could i use acronis disk director to copy disk to an external </s>
<s> and then what do i do install both drives and then set it u via the bios </s>
<s> also how do i restore the system copy from the external at that point </s>
<s> i am pretty nervous </s>
<s> also how do i find if i have the right drivers installed </s>
<s> and wouldn t those be on the motherboard </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> if you use acronis you use their true image product </s>
<s> disk director deals mostly with partitioning </s>
<s> you could use acronis true image to create a full backup image of your existing drive but you d want to be sure that the restoration process would go smoothly </s>
<s> you d be moving to raid 0 which means windows needs the raid drivers that go with your motherboard </s>
<s> those should come on the cd </s>
<s> you d need to enable the ports you want to use for raid and let windows detect the change so you could get the drivers in place </s>
<s> then you d create the disk image </s>
<s> next you d connect the two drives to the raid designated ports and boot into the raid bios to configure the drives </s>
<s> you ll be asked which drives to use and the two should already show </s>
<s> you ll be asked whether raid 1 or raid 0 but it may not be phrased that way </s>
<s> you select raid 0 </s>
<s> it may say quot performance quot and not mirror </s>
<s> once done you let the bios configure the array and all data will be lost on your old drive </s>
<s> once the array is created you boot from the acronis disk while the hd with the image you created is present on another hd </s>
<s> it could be an external </s>
<s> you have acronis restore the entire image to the raid array and you may alter the size of the partition at this time </s>
<s> once done you remove the acronis disk and restart the pc </s>
<s> you re enter the bios and set the raid array as the first hd in the boot sequence </s>
<s> cross your fingers and restart </s>
<s> if all goes well you re golden </s>
<s> if not you troubleshoot </s>
<s> personally i don t recommend doing this </s>
<s> you re going to need a good backup plan </s>
<s> the array will eventually fail </s>
<s> it s not a matter of quot if quot but quot when quot </s>
<s> you do want to be sure the hds you use are specified for raid use </s>
<s> some newer drives have sophisticated re alignment cycles that cause problems with raid </s>
<s> you re on your own </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> yeah i will have to get true image </s>
<s> and as far as the driver disk goes um thats in the garbage </s>
<s> i got this tower from my moms boss which was originally configured for raid 0 and they wanted to wipe the drives so i had put an 3 5 in it until they gave me the drives back </s>
<s> then i used crummy easus disk copy to get it on one of the original disks then i decided to shoot for raid </s>
<s> i know i painted myself into a corner </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> these two drives were originally manufactured for raid </s>
<s> yeah i do alot of that quot cross your fingers and restart quot thanks dude </s>
<s> you cleared a lot up for me </s>
