<s> i recently was upgraded at work to windows 2000 i have a lexmark e238 pinter </s>
<s> prior to upgrade i was able to print documents with no problems </s>
<s> since the upgrade when printing saved documents in wordperfect 8 i get quot gibberish quot language the characters look like playing card suits and emoticons </s>
<s> strangely i have no problems with documents i just type out and have not save </s>
<s> i downloaded the updated driver for the printer </s>
<s> this does not happen in any other programs </s>
<s> is is possible for a communication problem with corel and lexmark </s>
<s> or corel lexmark windows </s>
<s> can any one help </s>
<s> thank you for any assistance </s>
<s> try updating the drivers and i think you will have to use one of the ps post script ones </s>
<s> gt gt try updating the drivers and i think you will have to use one of the ps post script ones lt lt thanks for suggestion unfortunately i already tried this </s>
<s> it is definately the printer and wordperfect </s>
<s> i switched with co worker and her printer hp worked fine </s>
<s> i may have to see if we can make switch permanent or see if boss will spring for new printer </s>
<s> but will would like to see if i can resolve it first </s>
<s> have you get the drivers from corel or such </s>
<s> someone suggested using a universal driver pcl driver for the printer </s>
<s> i figured it couldn t be any worse than what i had so i found it at lexmark downloaded it clicked on the exe file and let it do its work </s>
<s> one thing in case anyone has the same problem is it told me to click on quot add new printer quot and not to choose a manufacturer but to just click on quot have disk quot </s>
<s> i kept on picking the exact printer name i had </s>
<s> went to the folder that was created after i click the exe and follow the path to the inf file </s>
<s> the system named the printer lexmark universal not lexmark e238 which is what i kept trying to call it </s>
<s> in case anyone needs it the name of file would be lexmark_ud0_2kxp03_x86_pcl_emul_sys_en exe not sure how to post the link for it but the description under it is quot lexmark lexmark universal pcl emulation system driver quot </s>
<s> thanks for all help </s>
<s> btw will also keep in mind about the drivers for corel </s>
<s> i ll track them down in case i need them for the future </s>
<s> sorry for length of this post </s>
<s> i am now going to go off and dance the happy dance </s>
