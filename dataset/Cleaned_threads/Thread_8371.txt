<s> i am just starting to learn home network so this might be simple to resolve or not </s>
<s> i have 2 computers next to each other </s>
<s> a cable from each is run to an ethernet switch </s>
<s> i ran network wizzard on both computers using xphome sp1 on both </s>
<s> i gave permission on several folders on both computers </s>
<s> when i go to quot my network places quot i can see the folders listed from both computers </s>
<s> if i click on a local folder i get access </s>
<s> when i click on the client computer i get this message clientname folder is not accessable </s>
<s> you might not have permission to use this network souce </s>
<s> contact the administrator of this network to find out if you have access permissions </s>
<s> not enough server storage is available to process this command </s>
<s> any help getting me started is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> i would like to be able to have file and printer shareing and access to the internet from the client computer </s>
<s> i do have file and printer shareing turned on for both computers </s>
<s> thank you rick </s>
<s> i just found out that the printer shareing works i just need the file shareing to work and connecting to the internet from the client computer </s>
<s> you might want to try setting up a user account on each machine for the other </s>
<s> this should allow you access </s>
