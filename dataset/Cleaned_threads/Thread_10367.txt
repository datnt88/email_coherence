<s> picked out these two </s>
<s> ripjaws eco </s>
<s> which would you suggest if being used on a gaming build </s>
<s> what the motherboard maker recommends </s>
<s> or if the seller has a no quibble return policy i start with cheapest </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> motherboard is asus p7p55d e pro </s>
<s> the price between them is too small to matter </s>
<s> i need someone experienced to suggest which one to use i will be using it for a long time </s>
<s> for your motherboard model they will have a qualified vendor list including many ram manufacturers and model s depending on your needs </s>
<s> one need is will be cpu speed that should be properly matched </s>
<s> cpu is i5 750 os is win7 home premium 64 bit </s>
<s> really someone experienced just suggest one of the two </s>
<s> but using a period in the title is also an annoyance </s>
<s> so you re looking for someone experienced but you didn t say in what way </s>
<s> do you need to find someone with that motherboard who has tried both models of that ram to make a recommendation </s>
<s> you ll wait a very long time then and if that s true my experience won t </s>
<s> my only experience is that i have an asus p755d series board and i did use the qualified vendor listing to help me select my compatible ram and what i bought has worked wonderfully well </s>
<s> that s the best i can offer </s>
<s> good luck finding an acceptable response </s>
<s> all i want is someone knowledgeable to recommend one of the rams i want to make sure i get the better </s>
<s> i don t know why it s so hard to get such a simple reply </s>
<s> maybe you re just in the wrong forums </s>
<s> you asked generically about gaming but gave no details as to what your goal is </s>
<s> if you look at the specs for each module type you ll note that one says quot eco quot and this is just a cute word for eco friendly which is a phony marketing quot come on quot imo </s>
<s> hopefully this link won t violate forum policy as nothing of this type of discussion is specifically offered here </s>
<s> overclockers and g skill eco ram you might try posting your question in a forum of this type </s>
<s> personally i think you ve already received the best advice about finding compatible components but apparently that s not your quest </s>
<s> both sticks have the same timings and will perform the same </s>
<s> but the eco only requires 1 35v to meet it s timings </s>
<s> if you plan on overclocking the rip jaws would be the better choice since their higher voltage will tolerate oc ing </s>
