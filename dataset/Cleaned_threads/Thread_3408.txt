<s> i bought a lg dvdwriter on ebay </s>
<s> i cannot get this thing to show up on my system at all </s>
<s> my motherboard is all sata devices so i bought a ide to sata connection and nothing </s>
<s> so i bought a pci card that has the ide connections on it </s>
<s> nothing again </s>
<s> i thought it might be that i needed the drivers but i can t find them anywhere </s>
<s> lg s website has nothign on it except for tech specs </s>
<s> how was the drive jumpered </s>
<s> what does the resller say </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> it is set as a master since it is the only ide controlled item </s>
<s> i m using winxp 64bit ed </s>
<s> the seller will not let me return it </s>
<s> as far as drivers i can t find any at all for this burner </s>
<s> even on lg s website </s>
<s> not only must you find motherboard sata drivers but booting from a sata cd dvd only adds more misery </s>
<s> i m surprised that anyone would do this </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> this issue is not what it appears to be </s>
