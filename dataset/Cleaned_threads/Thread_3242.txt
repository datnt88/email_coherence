<s> i have a 16g san drive and the extra programs installed in it are absolutely infuriating </s>
<s> are there any large usb thumb drives around without that trash in them </s>
<s> 16gb no extra programs at least not that i recall </s>
<s> if it had any i simply deleted them </s>
<s> in any case why not simply delete the programs on your flash if you don t want to use them </s>
<s> last year i bought one of those cruze micro flash drives with the u3 software </s>
<s> simply reformatted it to wipe out the us software which was a waste of time </s>
<s> all flash drives can be reformatted to be quot plain jane quot </s>
<s> so far as i can tell the extra trash is in ram and cannot be erased </s>
<s> the extra stuff is in quot rom quot not quot ram quot </s>
