<s> good day i hope someone can assist by adding some light to this subject </s>
<s> i have an office with 7 windows xp desktops all running duel lg monitors except for 1 desktop </s>
<s> some monitors are wide and some square but all with the same issue </s>
<s> also about 3 out of 7 desktops has pci e radeon cards in them </s>
<s> the problem i am facing is that they were running this setup for the last 3 years until they had their tables changed to ones that can elevate up and down </s>
<s> with this in place having to get longer vga cables were needed and a simple 3meter vga db 15 cable 13 would do the trick </s>
<s> fitting the cables aren t any problem but as soon as i had them connected and then switched on the desktops </s>
<s> i realized that there is a bad blur on every single monitor even the desktop with one monitor </s>
<s> i later went and got a 5 meter vga cable to test with and the blur goes better but it is still there </s>
<s> i even went and tried updateing graphics driver for 3 machines 2 were radeon hd cards and 1 intel express chip </s>
<s> updated both with drivers and control centres but still no difference </s>
<s> having to plug back the original cables coming with the lg monitors works like a charm but then have the problem where i can t use the elevated tables </s>
<s> my question would be is there any quality differences between these cables you can buy or is it about the length that it looses signal strength </s>
<s> just keep in mind that the 5 meter worked better than the 3meter cable </s>
<s> could it be a compatibility issue that i am getting here or is it ust my luck that anything above 1 8meters will be more blurry than the original cable </s>
<s> any assistance will be appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the signals from a video card or any from a pc ports are limited to the quality of cable and length </s>
<s> your problem if you use ext </s>
<s> cables to std </s>
<s> cable you degrade the signal </s>
<s> if single longer cable the same result </s>
<s> you have reached the limits of video signal strength degradation and you see the results </s>
<s> either get quot high quality quot cables or a signal repeater that maintains signal strength </s>
<s> google for video boosters or similar here s one </s>
<s> alas this isn t going to be that cheap </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> hi and thank you for the reply </s>
<s> it makes a whole lot sense when you say that the signal is the part that gets weaker as the cable length becomes longer or attached to more cables as extensions </s>
<s> the way i am trying this is all with single cables nothing attached to extend or anything </s>
<s> just standard single cables but having to use the 3 meter cables made it very blurry and using the 5 meter cable was slightly better but still blurry </s>
<s> the 5 meter cable is a thicker insulated cable than the 3meter </s>
<s> that would be a better quality then </s>
<s> the best quality i am getting is from the original 1 8 meter cable which i can t use because of the length but i will check out those video boosters as well as every option will be tried and tested </s>
<s> otherwise having to buy proper quality vga cables might be my only option </s>
<s> how do i tell the difference in good or bad cables </s>
<s> i googled this question and found that they mention these signal blockers at the end of every side of the vga cable </s>
<s> also thicker sleeved cables are better quality </s>
<s> is this al true or should i know more than this </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
<s> honestly when it comes to quality price is pretty much the factor of what you get </s>
<s> also it should state its quot shielded properties quot </s>
<s> further even with a single cable of hi quality build and since you seem able to de attach it makes that an issue as well because the fact you have a build in break at the monitor </s>
<s> impedance is more introduced at all breaks in the cable length </s>
<s> in other words all connections imply a break though complete with proper setup depends on that being sound </s>
<s> you will notice the monitor s video cable is roughly 3 4ft 1m long </s>
<s> if you find another single cable i think the most it will be is 3m 8 9ft long and its a hit or miss it will work thus try only on 1 pc setup for now </s>
<s> you can google away for ideas but i suggest contact the monitor makers and see if they offer an optional cable </s>
<s> also try this website for some clues or parts tada willy </s>
<s> i am having the same problems with a 23 quot lg led monitor </s>
<s> the only cable that works properly is the cable that is supplied with the monitor </s>
<s> i need an 8 10 cable </s>
<s> if you have found a solution i would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know about it </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
<s> skip vga and go with a digital hdmi or digital dvi connection </s>
<s> hi nelsonrh i just bought a cheap cable quot 5m vga hd svga extension cable for pc monitor projector quot from ebay for 3 90 it work for my computer but when i turn the computer off and the lg monitor on it will show quot check signal cable quot </s>
<s> i think is about the pins some only have 14 pins connected not 15 pins but i am not sure </s>
