<s> hi everyone something odd happened last night </s>
<s> my pc has been working fine since i built it last christmas but suddenly got stuck with the cursor stuck on the egg timer icon </s>
<s> i couldn t get the cursor to move to the start button for a reboot as it would reach the task bar and go no further so i used the windows key to bring up the start menu and rebooted the computer using the keyboard shortcuts </s>
<s> so far so good but when the computer restarted the monitor remained blank and after about 20 seconds switched to standby as it wasn t receiving a signal from the pc </s>
<s> i checked the connections and all seemed to be secure so i tried again but with the same result </s>
<s> i noticed there was hard disk activity though but this stopped after a while </s>
<s> it was as though the computer was booting for some reason the data wasn t reaching the monitor </s>
<s> i don t have a spare monitor to check this out for myself so before i go to elaborate arrangements to get a lift to a friend s house and check on their monitor i wodnered if anyone had encountered this before </s>
<s> i m only guessing the pc is booting but i really have no idea what s happened </s>
<s> can anyone shed any light </s>
<s> cliff athlon 64 processor 512 mb ram 200 gig hard drive on board video and sound sharp 17 quot lcd monitor </s>
<s> power supply </s>
<s> too many skimp on the size and pay for it later </s>
<s> does the system beep </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s a 450 watt psu and there s hardly anything connected to it </s>
<s> no beeps i m afraid </s>
<s> cliff </s>
<s> try the bare minimum parts for beeps </s>
<s> power supply 450 is a good number so let s leave that motherboard cpu and the speaker </s>
<s> no other parts are required </s>
<s> if no beeps then remove the case and put it on cardboard </s>
<s> no beeps </s>
<s> you are looking at the possible bad parts </s>
<s> just fyi the bad part may not be defective </s>
<s> for instance some machines don t boot when the cmos battery is dead </s>
<s> or if a jumper is in the wrong place </s>
<s> or when the cmos values are wildly off </s>
<s> try resetting the bios settings with that jumper bob </s>
