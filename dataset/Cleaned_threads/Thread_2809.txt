<s> before receiving help and support from microsoft i am promped to enter my product id </s>
<s> i have a valid oem copy of vista home premium but microsoft says that my product id is not valid </s>
<s> my copy of vista was installed by hewlett packard on one of their new machines </s>
<s> my computer lists the os product id and says that this copy of vista is activated </s>
<s> i have registered my computer through hp but no one there that i have spoken to regarding this seems to have even a clue of what i am talking about </s>
<s> as a for instance i ask quot how do i get microsoft to recognize that my copy of vista home premium is valid quot they answer quot it is quot when i try to explain and ask for an answer i am put on hold and or transferred and or disconnected </s>
<s> so i thought that i d ask you folks </s>
<s> can anyone help </s>
<s> oems are not supported by microsoft </s>
<s> the only support is from the computer company in your case hp </s>
<s> if you had purchased and installed a full retail version operating system it would include some support from microsoft </s>
<s> microsoft will disavow any knowledge or help on this one </s>
<s> it s beginning to seem to me that it is all set up this way to kind of monopolize the help and support area of their business </s>
<s> however if this is anywhere near true then why in the world would they have established links to the microsoft help and supprt page that do not work </s>
<s> could it be that they cannot remove them because they are an intrinsic part of the vista os </s>
<s> and if this is indeed true then why aren t a lot of folks talking complaining about it </s>
<s> out of the box these things do work or you put it back in the box as defective </s>
<s> i do not think it s any conspiracy but the rampant virus malware and other stuff can damage the machine if you don t firewall it from day zero </s>
<s> most vendors now understand this </s>
<s> sorry to see you struggle but as the story is told so far it s a back in the box and ask for another </s>
