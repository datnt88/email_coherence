<s> i currently am doing audio recording using a compaq ap550 workstation which has dual p3 processors 1ghz each 1gb rdram an nvidia quadro 4 980 8x agp the mobo only runs 4x all legacy disabled and my audio is via usb 2 0 m audio fasttrack pro </s>
<s> i also have a creative labs x fi fidelity sound card </s>
<s> 18gb scsi u160 system disk and ata 100 250gb storage </s>
<s> lite on cdrw dvd rw combo </s>
<s> i m running xp sp2 </s>
<s> i want to upgrade the system and am currently reviewing motherboards </s>
<s> i d like to keep as much existing hardware as possible though i will replace the scsi with a sata drive </s>
<s> the quadro was a worker in its day but i suspect replacing it with as good a pci ex for the reasonable i paid is going to be tough </s>
<s> i m considering an asus p5vd1 x 2gb ddr2 and a pentium d 2 66ghz </s>
<s> as it supports both agp 8x and pci ex i could use my quadro until i m ready to pop for a new gc </s>
<s> any thoughts on these boards </s>
<s> they are hard to find new and seem to have been replaced with the p5vd2 x pci ex only </s>
<s> same board but no agp it seems </s>
<s> are there any others i might consider </s>
<s> but you need to say goodbye to agp and most stuff in your compaq </s>
<s> keep the m audio x fi 250gb drive and cd dvd combo </s>
<s> your quadro is based on geforce 4 gpus </s>
<s> a geforce 7600 or radeon x1600 will run circles around it and they re only 120 </s>
<s> also don t get a pentium d its obsolete tech </s>
<s> a core2duo e4300 is the least you should consider </s>
<s> here s a suggested self build for a 1000 pc </s>

<s> thanks good suggestions especially the graphics comparisons </s>
<s> i already have vista business ready to go except that m audio and much of the recording hardware is still behind the curve so it will have to be xp for a while longer </s>
<s> 64 bit even later </s>
<s> i have a new case ps and wireless kb mouse etc </s>
<s> core duo makes sense as i m already sold on multi processors anyway </s>
