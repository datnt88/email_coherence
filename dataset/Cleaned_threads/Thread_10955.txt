<s> does anyone know of a way to make color corrections using the photosmart 8250 </s>
<s> i have read the brief manual gone through the hp imaging software and tried every way i can think of to correct the extreme amount of magenta the printer is using for photos </s>
<s> this problem is especially bad with flesh tones they come out a bright pink </s>
<s> while i can quot guess quot and make changes with photoshop for each image life would be better if i could adjust the printer settings to more accurately match the computer screen </s>
<s> how did the cnet editor who gave the 8250 a 7 4 miss this </s>
<s> it s a major problem </s>
<s> i m beginning to think there is no way to make color corrections with the printer i want my epson stylus back </s>
<s> thanks for any suggestions </s>
<s> don t know if what you re looking for can be found here </s>
<s> or maybe it has to do with your camera </s>
<s> some cameras need a firmware update mine did </s>
<s> rick </s>
<s> i have the hp 8250 and had some what the same problem when i first got it </s>
<s> right click the 8250 in the control panel </s>
<s> click printing preference </s>
<s> click color which should be the last tab on the right </s>
<s> click advanced color settings </s>
<s> you should be able to adjust the colors to pretty much what you want </s>
<s> i was printing a lot of photos of people and couldn t get the skin tones right until i set the the color managment to colorsmart srgb </s>
<s> i am taking wedding photos now for a little extra money and picked up a epson stylus photo r380 and if people want a print i use that printer over the 8250 because of the quality of the pictures </s>
