<s> i have just gone from windows 2000 to windows xp professional full clean install and now my graphics card is being recognized only as a pci card under the cards properties it says that the location is pci 1 also i know that it there is a problem because every time i load up savage it tells me that my card is in pci mode and this will cause problems which it does </s>
<s> i have tried uninstalling the card reinstalling it using an older card that still came up as pci and had no joy with anything </s>
<s> my pc specs are as follows windows xp pro sp1 abit at7 max2 motherboard amd athlon xp 2600 galaxy geforce fx 5200 the other card i tried was an abit geforce ti 4200 1gb pc2700 ram note i have noticed a few people suggesting that you need to reformat reinstall to resolve this problem however seeing as that s what i have just done i don t see how that would have any effect </s>
<s> any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated </s>
<s> cheers ben </s>
<s> this is a cosmetic item with no real effect </s>
<s> i would not fix this </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> you didn t note if the bios and motherboard drivers were current </s>
<s> for reference another discussion about it quot i fixed this on my computer </s>
<s> i have a ti4600 on an asus p4t e motherboard </s>
<s> any time i went to the adapter settings screen i saw that it said my card was agp running in pci mode </s>
<s> after a lot of reading and searching i read on intel s site that you need to run an inf updater to get this motherboard and 100 others to communicate properly with the agp slot </s>
<s> i looked up the files for my chipset i850 and downloaded the inf updater </s>
<s> i ran the updater had to unzip it and then run the setup program and rebooted my computer </s>
<s> it found all kinds of new hardware for the bridges and installed it automatically </s>
<s> quot </s>
<s> install using xp specific drivers for your mtrbd </s>
<s> video </s>
<s> if needed try the latest ones available from the mtrbd </s>
<s> support website </s>
<s> under the bios verify what agp setting are at try going to a lower level just to get it to work and if does goto the next level or higher rate </s>
<s> if capable allow the bios to quot use optium setting quot or quot safe setting quot to restart that area </s>
<s> if all fails simply quot clear quot the bios and then reset values </s>
<s> fyi i found video to be an increasing difficult area to work in lately </s>
<s> in many cases going back to older drivers or recheck the newest driver is a perfect match for the video card installed </s>
<s> so i don t find your problem a lone one others i m sure have similar problems </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> he s running an amd based system not intel based </s>
<s> but i understand what you re saying </s>
<s> in other words ecobweb go find the chipset drivers for your motherboard from the abit website </s>
<s> go to this link for your drivers here s their site for the newest bios hope this helps </s>
<s> the item in question has been spotted by me a few times and some descend in another spiral of problems as they quot fix quot such things </s>
<s> proceed with care </s>
<s> found out some stuff for ya </s>
<s> turns out when you see the location of the video card as quot pci bus 1 quot that is ok if you want to make sure download the latest drivers for your video card from nvidia s website or use gainward s own drivers from their website </s>
<s> also if you are able to edit your registry regedit exe go to the following key hkey_local_machine software nvidia corporation global nvtweak right click the right side of the two quot sides quot then click on quot new dword value quot </s>
<s> name the value quot coolbits quot then set it as quot ffffffff quot </s>
<s> this will enable all the quot secret quot pages in the video properties page </s>
<s> right click on the desktop and then on quot properties quot </s>
<s> under the nvidia properties go to where it should says quot agp settings quot </s>
<s> on that tab there is a slider that enables you to change from quot pci quot to quot agp quot </s>
<s> did you change the option in the cmos to show you are running an agp card </s>
<s> i believe the default for this setting is pci </s>
