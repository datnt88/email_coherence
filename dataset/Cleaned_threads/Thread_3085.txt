<s> i have recently had 2 maxtor hdds shown to be quot failing quot when tested with powermax </s>
<s> one had already completely crashed failed see below and the other is still going but on its last legs its data is now backed up of course </s>
<s> one was 5 months old 250 giga and the other was 18 months old 160 giga </s>
<s> thanks to a fairly recent backup of the 250 giga i ve still got most of the data though some was lost </s>
<s> i think it s scandalous particularly in view of the fact that the 250 giga one was my main hdd containing win xp and all that that entails </s>
<s> is this normal behaviour for maxtor hdds </s>
<s> thanks chalkbel </s>
<s> i usually find such in overheated cases </s>
<s> the lifespans drop as the temperatures climb </s>
<s> i d look at that issue from the case and power supply angles </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> were both of these hds in the same system and one mounted on top of the other </s>
<s> this is important as closely mounted hds tend to create a quot hot spot quot and heat in general just isn t good for any electronics </s>
<s> plus large hds are usualy stuffed with platters and they re gettin the most out of the hd space and that can be tense as heat build up can cause aureal drift and or wear out the mechanicals faster due to tight tolerances </s>
<s> it can be one or all of these problems but they re closely related </s>
<s> for the most part i don t see a rash of maxtors failing more than others </s>
<s> i do suggest you cool your system as best as possible when you request warranty replacement if valid still </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> and one is 4 years old </s>
<s> thanks to all of you for your help </s>
<s> bob willy both of these hds are indeed in the same system and one mounted on top of the other so overheating looks like the problem </s>
<s> in that case i can expect it to happen again if i don t take action which i will </s>
<s> nerdyboy1234 i think you ve reassured me as to maxtor s durability </s>
<s> so i can stop looking at other makes thanks again chalkbel </s>
