<s> hi my problem is with my seagate 1tb expansion drive when im using this hard drive to watch films on my tv or media box it shuts off within the first 10 mins not exactly 10 mins could be 7 43 mins ect this hard drive does not turn off and works fine when its plugged into my computer i have done tests on seatools hd tune pro and window error checker for bad sectors problems ect and all seems fine </s>
<s> i dont think its a problem with seagates power saving mode but not 100 additional info this hard drive is not just powered by the computer it had to be plugged into a power socket for power it is usb 3 0 i only really use this hard drive for watching films on my tv and media box </s>
<s> but the number of posts about usb 3 0 drive troubles tells me you want this drive in a usb 2 0 case then try again </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you should check the tv setting and see if it has any for quot idle quot time or some time limit set to never or disregard </s>
<s> it maybe treating the device attached as not being polled and thus times out </s>
<s> if the timeout period is always the same </s>
<s> this can be called quot sleep mode quot as well </s>
<s> understand these newer tv s have alot of options now so don t rule it out </s>
<s> this is on top of any other areas to check </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> hi thanks for your reply the problem doesn t just happened with the tv it also happens with my media box and anything really that is compatible with usb and can play films the problem is with the hard drive </s>
<s> i d try this drive in some boring usb 2 0 case after checking one last time for any sleep feature </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> since you seem sure it is the ext </s>
<s> hd then consider the usb 3 0 side of things </s>
<s> i pretty sure that your media box and tv aren t usb 3 0 ready it is the ext </s>
<s> hd that has to supply this for usb 2 0 status </s>
<s> on this regard i think it fudges and finally winks out </s>
<s> in other words it loses the link it requires or deems necessary </s>
<s> if you did nothing to prep the ext </s>
<s> hd for use and thus accepted as is that maybe the crux of your problem </s>
<s> it may require once you eliminate everything else to allow either the media box or tv to format or pc to format using the typical format command </s>
<s> as always i still check the specs of all devices and see where they may differ or how it stands </s>
<s> so far i don t see in the docs how it relates to tv use it s more geared to pc use </s>
<s> afterall even if compatible some issues still arise </s>
<s> this link maybe informative note it doesn t directly say for tv use though usb 2 3 0 is supported </s>
<s> check the fine print under last table </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> software seagate drive settings software to allow the user to change the sleep time toggle the lights and run drive diagnostics on a windows computer </s>
<s> learn more from link hope this helps willy </s>
