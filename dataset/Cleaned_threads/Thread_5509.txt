<s> i need help upgrading my desktop pc which i bought 3 years ago </s>
<s> i run xp professional sp2 </s>
<s> my hardware specfications are pentium 4 1 7ghz 256 mb ram 32mb graphics card need help upgrading my hardware and what are the recommended upgrades </s>
<s> as it stands why upgrade </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> what computer make model </s>
<s> if a home build what motherboard make model </s>
<s> what video card model </s>
<s> what do you want to do with the computer </s>
<s> if gaming buy a new one </s>
<s> otherwise upgrade system ram to at least 512mb or possibly up to 1gb </s>
<s> maybe get a better video card but that depends on the computer model and what you want to spend </s>
<s> you need to discover if it can take an agp 4x 8x video card or just a pci video card pci express is not an option for a computer that old </s>
<s> bottom line if you do only one thing upgrade the system ram </s>
<s> windows xp likes at least 512mb and you will notice the difference </s>
<s> i don t like the idea of dumping too much money into that older system especially since nice new systems are inexpensive </s>
<s> i would upgrade ram then video replace and finally the cpu in that order </s>
<s> just getting more ram for a xp based system in practical terms is 512mb for good operation with 1gb for best overall </s>
<s> the other upgrades depending on your wallet should be considered but can wait provided you re happy with the ram upgrade alone </s>
<s> imho that is the route i would go </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> my computer is assembled at a shop my mother board is intel d850gb my video card is trident video accleator cyberblade xp 32mb my mother board has 3 free pci slots </s>
<s> it does not support pci express it only supports agp 2 4x 1 5v graphic cards </s>
<s> also my usb is 1 1 is ther any way to convert it to hi speed 2 1 </s>
<s> the usb 1 1 ports can t be upgraded but the pci card will provide additional usb ports that are version 2 0 </s>
<s> you will see a big improvement when you upgrade the ram from 512mb to 1gb </s>
<s> next big improvement would be to upgrade your graphic card to one that has at least 128mb memory </s>
