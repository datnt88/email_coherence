<s> why would the motherboard be an issue here </s>
<s> that is isn t wiring something any skilled technician be able to handle and wouldn t have to find a motherboard with the exact pin for pin connections </s>
<s> hint there is no standard for the onboard audio connections </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i just assumed that because the motherboard in my pc does not have the pin for pin connectivity that i require that there would motherboards on the market that do </s>

<s> are you planning to reuse the cpu and the ram or not </s>
<s> if yes is your mb a socket 939 and what ram are you using ddr ddr2 and what speed </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> you will never find such a board besides the make or model you have now </s>
<s> the internal connections for audio and a few others are not standardized so your skill at rewiring will come into play </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes i am planning to reuse the cpu the ram </s>
<s> the mb is socket am2 the ram is unbranded ddr2 the only other numbers on each stick is 667 unfortunately i can not find the invoice which lists the specific details of the pc s components </s>
<s> hope this is helpful </s>

<s> as bob said no need for new motherboard to add a capture or sound card </s>
<s> for info on your mobo download belarc advisor find what free pci slots are available and buy the appropriate cards </s>
<s> choose a capture card that does not require a seperate audio connection and problem solved </s>
<s> my compro digital anolouge tv tuner capture card requires no connection to the sound card </s>
<s> no doubt there others </s>
<s> it s up to date </s>
<s> here s the link for your motherboard mobo your mobo uses standardized usb pinouts </s>
<s> if your firewire card has an internal port it will be standardized also </s>
<s> your mobo has front panel audio port page 1 30 and an s pdif port page 1 28 with simple and fully documented pinouts </s>
<s> if you re still having problems connecting your multifunction panel you should replace it and not the motherboard </s>
<s> my apologies for not repling sooner but i have been away this week </s>
<s> just like to say thanks to everyone for their replies </s>
<s> i have taken on board all your comments and suggestions </s>
<s> i can now plan what hardware i must have and find a way to achieving the connectivity that i require </s>
<s> regards ian </s>
