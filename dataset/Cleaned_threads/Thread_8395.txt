<s> looking to buy a pc video editing system but confused about what makes the system faster where editing and rendering is concerned </s>
<s> please advise which memory am i better off with </s>
<s> ddr2 ecc sdram or 400mhz ddr memory 3 40 ghz single processor or xeon processor </s>
<s> does the video card make the difference </s>
<s> which video card do you recommend </s>
<s> thanks in advance pam 50 </s>
<s> we have a paltry 4 mb ati radeongo card on on dvd rendered box after we tested with some 2 hundred card and found no difference in performance </s>
<s> it seems to be all about the cpu cpu cache and memory speeds </s>
<s> next in line are hard disk speeds </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> most video editing software is extremely dependent on cpu and ram </s>
<s> i m not sure which way to go on the ram question i personally haven t put a lot of stock in ram speed differences </s>
<s> i use an amd athlon 64 cpu and pc 2700 ddr ram 1 5gb running avid xpress pro editing software </s>
<s> i have basically no problems with rendering layers etc </s>
<s> i also am running internal ata ide drives and connecting both usb and firewire external drives </s>
<s> access of the externals is sometimes a little slow but not enough to affect the editing performance </s>
<s> the video card requirements depend on the software requirements </s>
<s> for example avid and many other high end programs don t require more than about a 64mb video card in most cases </s>
<s> i run an nvidia 128mb card in my system </s>
<s> i ve been told not to waste my money on a high end high ram capacity video card for editing the current softwares won t use most of the onboard video ram anyway </s>
<s> look here 4 the ram ddr2 is better but the site backs me up </s>
<s> hav fun btw 4 this site may need to press refresh a couple of times till it is all loaded also look here for your graphics card question aswell </s>
<s> pam use the faster memory min 512mb gt 1 gig better </s>
<s> 3 0 intel p4 800mhz cpu will have enough power on a dual channel m b </s>
<s> visit the video guys here lots and lots of information on systems and video editing bill </s>
