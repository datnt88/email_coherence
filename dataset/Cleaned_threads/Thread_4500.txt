<s> i do not know much about ati so can you clear something up </s>
<s> what is the difference between the ati cards the x 800 the x 1300 and the x 1600 </s>
<s> hope you can help me with this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the x1300 and the x1600 are newer cards than the x800 but from what i ve seen the x1300 not necessarily faster in terms of gaming performance </s>
<s> however it was the high end previous generation card </s>
<s> the x1300 x1600 are current generation cards the x1300 is the low end card and the x1600 is the mid range card </s>
<s> the high end current generation cards are the x1800 and x1900 </s>
<s> you ll notice that the card names all have suffixes such as the ati radeon x1900xtx </s>
<s> i won t get too deep into the suffixes i ll tell you that xt is better than pro and gto is better than gt </s>
<s> i could also get into the crossfire dual video card stuff but i don t feel like it </s>
<s> nathan </s>
<s> thanks for clearing all that up </s>
<s> i do know a bit about high end ati cards because i want to buy i new computer sometime soon </s>
<s> i am also fairly knowedgable about crossfire and stuff </s>
<s> i was wondering if i was to upgrade my agp fx 5700 le video card to something less than 200 tat plays oblivion and other such games fairly well </s>
<s> would the x800 x1300 or the x1600 fit into that criteria well </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> just save that money and put it into your new pc </s>
<s> i d suggest that you build the new pc </s>
<s> if you want to play oblivion i d recommend the x1800xt for 280ish on newegg </s>
<s> but the x1800xt is a pcie card so get that with a new comptuer </s>
<s> thank you for the advice </s>
<s> i am planning to get a new computer but i would rather get a newer car 7900 gtx or 1900 xtx or even slid or crossfired cards </s>
<s> anyway if i was to upgrade my computer which of these cards x800 x1300 x1600 or any other agp cards you think are good should i upgrade my computer with </s>
<s> are pcie cards </s>
<s> what is your budget for the new agp card </s>
<s> sorry i meant that i would buy one of these new cards for the new computer </s>
<s> i would rahter the card i buy be under 200 so i can make the new computer really good </s>
<s> any suggestions such as the x800 x1300 or the x1600 </s>
<s> they obviously have to be agp cards </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
