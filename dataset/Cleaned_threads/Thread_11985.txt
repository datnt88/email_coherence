<s> i was wondering which multifunction printer is better </s>
<s> also was having a hard time finding out how much memory epson 4540 has </s>
<s> the memory is usually enough to perform the tasks given </s>
<s> as such few printers offer how much ram is in the printer </s>
<s> can you share with the forum why this matters </s>
<s> according to a conversation with epson the epson workforce pro 4540 do not have memory like other printers </s>
<s> they also didn t want to comment on how it works either </s>
<s> about comparing the two epson workforce pro 4540 vs hp officejet pro 8600 premium which one would you lean towards and why </s>
<s> my findings so far according to just specs sheets the hp 8600 looks good but according to videos the epson 4540 looks pretty good </s>
<s> since epson won t talk to you about your concerns the other models wins by default </s>
