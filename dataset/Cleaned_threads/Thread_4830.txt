<s> hello everybody i m in the 3rd month of a frustrating ordeal with a custom built pc i ll explain the issue then post a dxdiag report </s>
<s> the issue while playing ddo dungeons dragons online i m experiencing fps frames per second of around 2 50 while other players are running constantly above 100 fps no matter what the condition is </s>
<s> i thought it might be the network considering the pc is a quad core amd 9500 2 20ghz with 4gb ddr2 533 ram and an ati radeon 4890 with 1gb onboard memory but i ve done tracert s and ping t tests to gls ddo com and all are coming back with great times there was 1 however that was 2098ms delay in the ping but it was only once in a half hour gaming session and while gaming the fps is inconsistent sometimes it s around 5fps other times it s around 115 fps however 115 is the highest that i ve achieved while gaming which mean s it s very rare to achieve it but i have done it so i might as well mention it </s>
<s> i ve thought about overclocking my cpu but i think it should work without overclocking am i thinking wrong </s>
<s> also i m not the best when it comes to overclocking so i normally don t do it </s>
<s> let s say non knowledgeable </s>
<s> i ve also recently updated the motherboard bios which were originally from 2007 version 1604 now it has version 2302 from 2009 i didn t download the beta because it s quot beta quot and i m trying to solve problems not make more but i found out today there is stability issues the pc just shuts down mid game running real player in the background and that was the only other app running and it just shut down so i m going to replace the bios with version 1604 so i can pin point the fps issue within the game </s>
<s> i ve messed with various settings within the game itself and some seem to help others just hinder such as using the directx if i do use it the fps is cut in half literally </s>
<s> so i turned it off and it goes back up </s>
<s> also side note about the bios the dxdiag says it s v6 0 and this report was ran before the bios was updated so now i m actually questioning some things while i m typing this the motherboard is an asus m2a vm power supply is brand new 600w along with the video card the ati hd radeon 4890 we needed the power supply to run the video card i am literally banging my head against a wall trying to figure this out and i need a fresh set of eyes on this </s>

<s> others say that shutting down some of the background services of your o s will also improve frame rates this can be done safely using either amd s fusion for gaming or iobit s game booster after you have installed the new drivers bios etc </s>

<s> i ve used version 5001 last night and even though it performed better fps wise it was unstable and caused my system to crash while loading into the game or into a mission so i m back to using v1604 beta only because that is the most stable bios version that i ve found i ve tried v2302 v2001 v1705 but again went back to using v1604 i will upgrade my drivers via your posts and also i have heard about the sound card thing i was going to try it last night but unfortunately i didn t have one laying around so i ll go up to walmart tonight and get a cheapy that way i can return it if it doesn t help but i am willing to try anything at this point </s>
<s> in regards to the amd fusion i do have that installed and use the quot online gaming quot profile to shut down unnecessary background services and programs </s>
<s> and yes that does help to my surprise on average in an explorable area without fusion running it s around 40fps with fusion running it s around 60fps and with that running is when i saw an fps of 115 so that i know works and will recommend it to anyone with a compatible cpu </s>
<s> i see that you are using a very small hard drive it s a well known fact that the bigger the hard drive the faster a computer will run </s>
<s> with vista 64 i have it myself i wouldn t use anything under 500 gb </s>
<s> quot unknown ram quot go to the asus website and check their qvl for compatible ram for your mobo using cheapo ram will also cause instability issues </s>

<s> a cheapo sound card can add to the stability problem and at the same time may not be compatible with vista if the problem still persists using the new sound card you can always return it </s>
