<s> i used gparted in ubuntu to shrink my ubuntu partition and enlarge my windows partition </s>
<s> halfway through enlarging the windows partition the windows partition was mounted for some reason and the resize process stopped </s>
<s> now i ve got this discrepancy img img how do i get windows to read this partition as the 62 5 gb partition it should be </s>
<s> bow to the inevitable purchase of partition magic </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i ve certainly learned my lesson </s>
<s> but is there no way to fix it besides a windows reinstall restore </s>
<s> partition resizing even with pm is never a sure thing so everyone usually tells everyone to backup </s>
<s> since it sounds like you must start over why not just partition from the getgo </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well i m thinking linux probably isn t worth the trouble anyway so i ll just figure out what to do with my hp recovery partition didn t shell out extra for actual vista install disks and start over </s>
<s> i m not trying to insult you but just to make sure you do understand that the partition in question the windows partition is completely usable in fact i m on it right now but windows doesn t recognize its size correctly </s>
<s> i reread your post looked at the picture and can t see why i d repair this </s>
<s> gt let s be clear about what you want to do here </s>
<s> if it s working why fix this </s>
<s> if you want to add that 5 12gb to the quot winblows quot partition i think only a few simple steps might be needed </s>
<s> now i have to repeat the quot backup first quot everytime we write about such things but my thoughts are this </s>
<s> 1 in disk management delete the 5 12gb parition </s>
<s> maybe the other one too </s>
<s> 2 we want to have unallocated space </s>
<s> i can t explain why so many times people can t or won t do this step </s>
<s> they continually make a partition rather than leaving it unallocated </s>
<s> now we might be ready for gparted to grow the winblows partition </s>
<s> you would also be ready for a nearly painless install of most linux distros </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> nothing here shows me this issue </s>
<s> from the posts so far and the picture all looks exactly as it should be </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> notice that quot winblows quot partition in the top pane has a listed capacity of 44 46 gb </s>
<s> this was it s original size before i attempted to resize it </s>
<s> in the lower pane the quot winblows quot partition is listed as 62 5 gb </s>
<s> this is the size that i was resizing it to </s>
<s> if i look at the drive in explorer it also tells me the partition is 44 46 gb </s>
<s> so basically i m missing the 18 gb </s>
<s> 44 46 the sizes of my other partitions do not add up to an 80 gb hdd </s>
<s> and thanks for all your help so far bob </s>
<s> and other readings tells me that you are in the middle of the resize operation </s>
<s> the shrink is now about 1 2 done </s>
<s> look at this link and use gparted to grow the partition back to full size </s>
<s> about disk management </s>
<s> it s a dunce at this partition feature and can t pull off this trick of having a partition be 60gb but set the capacity to lower </s>
<s> sorry that you have to lead me around to the error but i didn t see it till you pointed right at it </s>
<s> and again we always are ready for a total wipeout when we do these things </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> booting off the ubuntu live cd it looks like i don t have any room to grow the partition </s>
<s> i think the partition resizing process died right before the filesystem could be grown to fill the partition </s>
<s> the screenshot above shows that gparted says the partition is 62 5 gib but the system monitor says the file system is only 44 5 gb </s>
<s> should i do something to grow the filesystem </s>
<s> i ll be out of town for a week without access to the internet </s>
<s> i ll get back on this when i m back </s>
<s> thanks again for the help so far bob </s>
<s> i d shrink it by 1 gb and grow it back </s>
<s> the idea here is to help it fix the issue </s>
<s> you could also dust off dev sda3 </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i meant dust off the areas between winblows and the hp recovery partition </s>
<s> what i do is to do all the shrinking and growing first </s>
<s> then when that s all settled down i create the new partitions for linux </s>
<s> many try to do it all at one time but i don t </s>
<s> i can only guess that i m dodging the bullet </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i fixed my mbr and deleted my linux partitions </s>
<s> whenever i try to grow the windows partition that partition is mounted at some point in the process even though i unmounted it right before i began the resize process </s>
<s> how can i keep it from mounting the partition </s>
<s> trying it again it worked and everything went back to normal despite the fact that it failed before resizing the filesystem </s>
<s> i m not sure how that works but whatever </s>
<s> windows is confused as there is a registry entry which records partion information </s>
<s> it may update itself after a few restarts but if not it needs to be reset deleted </s>
<s> after a restart all should be well </s>
<s> the key that needs to be deleted is hkey_local_machine system mounted devices </s>
<s> so you can choose the partition manager i used to use this 3rd software to resize partition </s>
<s> work well </s>
<s> and it is free for use absolutely </s>
<s> worth to try </s>
