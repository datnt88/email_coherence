<s> i just bought this antec tp ii 380 power supply and i found out that it dont have a 5v at the atx connector </s>
<s> after i connect it up it successfully boot up the system mainboard using 20 pin atx connector </s>
<s> so i was wondering what was the 5v use for and will it affect the stability my pc </s>
<s> url for the power supply </s>
<s> the 5v was used in the ibm pc the 8088 models to power ram which at the time needed that supply </s>
<s> today it s not used afaik </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> another rail that i don t believe has been used in a while is the 12v </s>
<s> quot the full pci specification lists 5 volt 3 3 volt 12 volt and 12 volt power rails quot while i can t recall a pci card that relied on the 12v line it was also used in older rs232 driver chips that were used at least till the pentium 1 days </s>
<s> maybe longer </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s only used on the atx 20 pin and the rail is like 5a or less </s>
<s> the common mc1488 needs a separate 12 volt supply </s>
<s> both 12 and 12 volt is required and not optional </s>
<s> this was a defacto standard in pc designs for decades and didn t require much power as you noted </s>
