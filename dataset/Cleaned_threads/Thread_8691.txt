<s> some of dvd burners are sensitive to their place on a bus master or slave device </s>
<s> check the user manual or try both alternatives </s>
<s> i had a similar problem with my hp media center pc essentially the same model </s>
<s> i tried using nero7 and other software as well and none of them liked the hp dvds that i was using </s>
<s> then i tried some of the mitsui dvd rs that i had on hand </s>
<s> those worked fine </s>
<s> so it may just not like your media </s>
<s> i tried all the suggestions </s>
<s> none helped though but i appreciate the very quick response to my dilemma </s>
