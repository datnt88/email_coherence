<s> i have a problem with my pc </s>
<s> pc specs amd 1 90ghz 248mb ram 32 mb pci video card </s>
<s> when i transfer the pc to the other room and connected back all the cables i turn on the pc and the screen is blank </s>
<s> i check the pc to the other monitor but nothing happens </s>
<s> i tried to disconnect the monitor to the video card and tried it on the top stock one and still the screen is blank </s>
<s> the pc runs fine </s>
<s> fans are working well </s>
<s> can someone have an idea how to solve this </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> probably your video card has become loose in its socket </s>
<s> you can remove the case cover loosen the screw and reseat it </s>
<s> power off </s>
<s> check the video cable connector pins </s>
<s> be sure they aren t bent or broken off </s>
<s> unplug at each end to do a visual inspection of the connectors </s>
