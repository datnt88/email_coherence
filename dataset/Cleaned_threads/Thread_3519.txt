<s> hello my mother has an compaq presario that s a few years old </s>
<s> it s running windows xp pro </s>
<s> she called and said that the peripherals started working intermittently monitor keyboard mouse and now they don t work at all </s>
<s> she says that the pc turns on but nothing else does </s>
<s> no lights on the keyboard monitor doesn t come on does anyone know what the problem could be </s>
<s> i m going to go over and try to fix it </s>
<s> i ve done basic work on pc s like adding memory drives so i m pretty comfortable quot getting under the hood quot </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> i bring a spare usb 2 0 pci card </s>
<s> be prepared </s>
<s> you think it could be something wrong with the usb card </s>
<s> but then why wouldn t the monitor work </s>
<s> the monitor isn t usb </s>
<s> you may have the classic dead pc </s>
<s> you are lucky in there are many articles on what to do </s>
<s> here s the link gt bob ps </s>
<s> i still bring my parts box </s>
<s> i m not sure that would apply as the actual pc turns on just nothing else </s>
<s> thanks for the link </s>
<s> the methods used are what i use even if it s just power only </s>
<s> we unplug cards etc but if i write that method i d just be duplicating the web contents </s>

<s> thank you </s>
