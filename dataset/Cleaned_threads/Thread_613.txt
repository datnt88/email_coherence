<s> what s your opinion on defragging ram memory </s>
<s> seems to be a lot of utilities out there for it but is it necessary </s>
<s> does it really work </s>
<s> the era of ram doublers and such were pretty much shown to be nothing but a scam </s>
<s> instead simple reading of the optimizing windows or the memory articles at would pay off well if you run windows </s>
<s> linux has its own memory management and has improved steadily </s>
<s> even with that some may find such to be useful but i ve never used any except to debunk the software </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> if you have win98 or better you really don t need any quot ram managers quot or such as the benefit isn t worth loading the pgm actually when you remove the pgm </s>
<s> the ram space it used is returned to the system is a plus </s>
<s> if you run win95 you should get some improvemnt and even then why are you using win95 </s>
<s> unless you system uis so screwed up or being doggy get a systems ultiies that clean the registry and defrag the hds for a better result of overall system performance </s>
<s> if you haven t already increase quot physical ram quot while costs are very low as a true system benefit </s>
<s> good luck willy </s>
<s> kind of what i was thinking </s>
<s> not as knowlegeable on memory as i should be </s>
<s> i am running win98 224mb ram </s>
<s> not really doggy but seeing all these downloads made me wonder </s>
<s> thanks for the replies </s>
