<s> i have a hp pavilion a6030 desktop and want to upgrade the psu and graphics card </s>
<s> it is currently a delta 300w psu but i am not sure if a standard atx psu will fit </s>
<s> any advice </s>
<s> atx power supply dimensions are easy to find on the internet so you can check if a stock unit will do </s>
<s> it should take a standard psu unit such as antec atx with no problems go to a 500w or so and you will be fine have used them in hp units as retrofit </s>
<s> many thanks i will try that as soon as possible </s>
<s> thanks for the quick response </s>
