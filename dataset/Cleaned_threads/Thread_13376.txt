<s> my brand new asus g75 laptop won t recognize my western digital 1tb external hard drive </s>
<s> it works in my friend s almost identical laptop and my laptop is correctly recognizing other usb inputs </s>
<s> the hard drive spins when plugged in but the led on the exterior of the drive doesn t come on </s>
<s> i m pretty sure it isn t showing up in device manager or disk management </s>
<s> i ve also tried all the ports </s>
<s> i think i read somewhere that some driver updates can screw up the usb s but the problem only comes up with this hard drive </s>
<s> here are where i ve looked for it </s>
<s> things to try 1 use the laptop with the power adapter </s>
<s> 2 use an y usb cable two connectors one extra for power 3 use a powered hub in between </s>
<s> the combination of 2 and 3 should work but maybe one of them is enough already </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> you shouldn t need any drivers for your setup to work </s>
<s> it should be recognized from the usb port once connected as the os supplies the necessary acknowledgement </s>
<s> adding to what kees has already stated be 100 sure the usb ports of your laptop are actually enabled </s>
<s> if you installed any s w to correct remove or uninstall its not needed </s>
<s> since you didn t mention what os was being used i assume its win7 </s>
<s> also i assume the laptop itself was properly all updated for use to its latest to include the os and mtrbd </s>
<s> drivers and possibility bios as well </s>
<s> as for s w installed i exclude what maybe wd bundle supplied for better use of the ext </s>
<s> hd not as a driver </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> is the the power adapter for the external hard drive plugged in </s>
<s> hi did you get any solution to the above problem mentioned </s>
<s> i need a solution as i am facing the exact same issue wd 1tb drive and asus g75 laptop </s>
<s> i find many are looking a solution that does not involve any changes </s>
<s> bob </s>
