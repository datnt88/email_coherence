<s> hello i m thinking of buying the samsung 244t widescreen lcd for my pc </s>
<s> i m also buying a new pc and want to make sure everything s compatible </s>
<s> what will i need as far as a video card </s>
<s> i know that some pc games are compatible with 16 9 ratio but what about the ones that aren t </s>
<s> will they be stretched out or just normal size 4 3 on the screen with black bars on the left and right of the screen </s>
<s> any help is much appreciated </s>
<s> thanks tim </s>
<s> if a display ain t wide enough black bars appear along the top and bottom </s>
<s> if it s too wide i m sure black bars appear on the sides instead </s>
<s> as for a vid card just check to see it supports widescreen resolutions divide the numbers to see if you get the 16 9 ratio </s>
<s> i run the we work to find solutions for individual games </s>
<s> each game is different in it s support of widescreen </s>
<s> some games won t support it and you will have the option of stretching or black bars </s>
<s> those that do support a non stretched resolution might not have a perfect fov </s>
<s> if your montior supports 1 1 or aspect scaling then you won t have any problems </s>
<s> if not nvidia offers this option in their drivers </s>
<s> ati does not </s>
<s> you won t see a widescreen res in your driver list until you hook up a widescreen monitor </s>
<s> they should appear automatically </s>
<s> if you re looking for a res that isn t there you ll have to add it manually </s>
<s> you can use a tool called powerstrip to do that </s>
<s> i believe you can also add custom res in the driver panel in nvidia s driver set </s>
<s> i have posted a query along the same lines but i now wonder if its a coincidence that the vast majority af tft s are standard 4 3 aspect </s>
<s> perhaps widescreen is more bother than it s worth as there are few unknowns about standard monitors </s>
