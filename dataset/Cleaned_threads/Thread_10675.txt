<s> specifically this is a hitachi travelstar 4k1202 5 inch ata ide hard disk drive in a freecom branded enclosure </s>
<s> the mini usb plug on the freecom hard drive enclosure has come loose and broken off rendering the thing useless </s>
<s> i opened the case and can see exactly what the problem is the little pins from the plug itself are not making sufficient contact with the circuit board </s>
<s> if i hold the plug and press tightly towards the circuit board the hard drive gets powered on or at least the led turns on but it doesn t seem to be sufficient for windows to recognize the drive </s>
<s> i m wondering if i should take the thing apart some more remove the drive from the circuit board and try connecting the hard drive to my computer directly using a hard drive cable what do you think </s>
<s> alternatively could i purchase a replacement enclosure and quot transplant quot my disk drive into the new enclosure </s>
<s> if so where could i buy something like that please help i am freaking out here </s>
<s> remove drive from the external case and connect the drive direct or buy an external enclosure </s>
<s> lots of options if you re located near a best buy or microcenter you should be able to pick up such a device pretty easily let us know how it goes </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i have the exact same problem </s>
<s> did you find a solution </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> see first reply </s>
