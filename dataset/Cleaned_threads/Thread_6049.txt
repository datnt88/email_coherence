<s> i took the ram out of an old computer and it is no longer compatible with my current and i m wondering if anybody knows any cpu s out there that would be able to accept this ram </s>
<s> i m not sure what info you ll need so this is all the info i can see on it </s>
<s> on the ram hyundai korea hy57v658020b 0024b tc 75 on the sticker hym7v631601 hyundai btfg 75 ba korea pc133u 333 542 a1 0028 this was taken from an older model dell dimensions 1000 i believe </s>
<s> most likely a fairly minimal amount of ram but some data i d like to retrieve </s>
<s> any help appreciated thanks </s>
<s> any such will be on the hard drive of the pc </s>
<s> the pc133 line will reflect the speed and i presume the 333 afterwards might be the timing </s>
<s> this will be older possibly 168 pin ram </s>
<s> i m thinking p 3 vintage maybe </s>
<s> in any event it won t be of use to find another pc to plug it into for data retrieval </s>
<s> it will be referred to as quot volatile quot memory because once power is withdrawn all that s stored is lost </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> well the pc has been recycled already it hadn t been working at all for a while </s>
<s> i took it to a shop and they said that it wouldn t be worth it to fix it </s>
<s> so is all lost or is there any other way to retrieve just from this </s>
<s> might be a different story </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> i feel really sorry for your pc that s pathetic nobody gave you any helpful reply for this </s>
<s> anyways if u would have this kind of situation any other time </s>
<s> to check what kind of ram memory u have in your computer </s>
<s> go to and scan your computer </s>
<s> it will exactly tell you what kind of memory your computer has </s>
<s> that s right your ram memory will tell ur computer speed and has nothing to do with ur data retrieval </s>
<s> but anyways if u need any other help please post it here </s>
<s> right on well thanks for all the answers anyway </s>
<s> i ll know for next time what is useful to salvage from the cpu </s>
