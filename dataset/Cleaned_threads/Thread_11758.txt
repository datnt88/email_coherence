<s> the same happens if i try to transfer more than about 2 gigs of files at one time </s>
<s> normal moving works fine </s>
<s> the problem happens if i try to take or move files from another computer </s>
<s> i get more data through if i take files though </s>
<s> 2 comps on xp pro and 1 on xp home </s>
<s> i was wondering what might cause this prob and if i switched to a router it might help </s>
<s> also 1 xp pro is sharing the internet connection </s>
