<s> the construction of my home makes it difficult to broadcast a wireless signal </s>
<s> i have tried a number of methods to improve the range of my wireless signal but nothing has helped much so far </s>
<s> i m hoping someone out there can help </s>
<s> here s the deal i currently have a cable modem hardwired to a linksys wireless router wrt54g </s>
<s> there are two network cables plugged into lan ports on the router </s>
<s> one cable goes to a desktop in the same room </s>
<s> the other cable runs to a second desktop upstairs on the other side of the house </s>
<s> both computers are on xp </s>
<s> i would like to access the internet wirelessly via laptop elsewhere in the house </s>
<s> if i stay near the room where the modem and wrt54g router are the connectivity is ok if i go upstairs to the side of the house opposite where the modem router are located it is terrible </s>
<s> i bought another router a linksys wrt300n about a year ago thinking that it has an expanded range </s>
<s> it didn t solve the problem </s>
<s> i then bought a linksys repeater and installed it on the network </s>
<s> it works but intermittently and it seems to go quot offline quot frequently </s>
<s> can i use both routers on my network </s>
<s> my idea would be to use one router as a switch in the downstairs room where the modem is </s>
<s> it would still be hardwired to the desktop pc in that room </s>
<s> the network cable that currently is hardwired to the desktop upstairs would go to the 2nd router which would act as both a feeder for the desktop upstairs as well as hopefully a wap for wireless laptops </s>
<s> i have read up on this a little bit and i think it will work but the router ip configuring seems like it could lead to problems </s>
<s> would a switch be better in place of the downstairs router </s>
<s> i appreciate any advice you can give me </s>
<s> if your second router can be configured as an access point that should work </s>
<s> it would need to be wired to your other router and get it s ip address from it </s>
<s> an access point is in a sense like a wireless switch </s>
<s> you re laptop negotiates a connection to it and then gets its ip address from the router </s>
<s> if either router allows a wap mode you should be ok </s>
<s> read post 17 at </s>
<s> thanks for the link to the forum sticky </s>
<s> i have the second router set up as a wap and the signal strength reception is great </s>
<s> my only remaining question is about security </s>
<s> it appears that the wireless from wap is simply creating a second network that is independent of the wired network downstairs </s>
<s> although i gave the wap the same ssid as my wired network this signal is unsecured </s>
<s> do i assign a different encrption for the wap and the laptops that use the signal or is there a way to integrate it into the security of the quot original quot network ssid </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> today we like wpa and if your hardware and machines allow it wpa2 </s>
