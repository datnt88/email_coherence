<s> my 533mhz p3 windows 98 has been freezing up intermittently ever since i had the processor cooling fans replaced old ones were making noise </s>
<s> i have taken it back to the shop twice and they cannot duplicate the problem </s>
<s> it works fine for them and they say the processor is not overheating </s>
<s> but when i get it back home it locks up </s>
<s> i ve tried plugging it into a different electrical outlet to no avail </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> they could be right </s>
<s> many shops are cooler than where the machine is at home </s>
<s> try this 1 remove the case cover </s>
<s> 2 point a fan at the innards </s>
<s> any difference </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> no difference i m afraid </s>
<s> beginning to suspect shop incompetence deception </s>
<s> unless it has to do with electrical service </s>
<s> or my peripherals </s>
<s> quot or my peripherals quot quot tip if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer related problem please be sure to include all the necessary information ie operating system model number hardware software etc that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution quot this tip is put up with every post </s>
<s> while it may or may not help i wish you the best in finding the cause and a cure but let s just state that old machines can go unstable even with the best of care </s>
<s> a prime example is this google gt also worth noting are the pests that we find on too many machines </s>
<s> i wrote up a short list about this at not many shops will alert people to this issue because it would run up a bill and inflict too much time educating the users </s>
<s> no offense intended here </s>
<s> now that we ve got a good idea it s not heat related we move to quot other items quot bob </s>
<s> i have exactly the same problem with 3 pcs </s>
<s> 2 of them are brand new celeron d machines </s>
<s> they work in my shop but not at my customers site </s>
<s> i have tried putting in a new power circuit and using surge protectors </s>
<s> the cpu and power fans work perfectly </s>
<s> i get lockups while in the bios or when windows starts or has been running for 20 30 min </s>
<s> i think it may be related to the wireless g communications card dlink </s>
<s> it works on some networks but not on others </s>
<s> do you have a wireless card in the pc </s>
