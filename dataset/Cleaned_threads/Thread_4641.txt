<s> i have a hp 2110 pcs all in one printer </s>
<s> it was working fine </s>
<s> last week one of my kids was playing around on my chair that quot goes around quot and started to fall and used the printer to catch himself </s>
<s> i thought everything looked ok and i am pretty sure i have used it since that happened but maybe not </s>
<s> my printer works if you use it without the computer tried that did all the possible checks i could </s>
<s> it has a error message that keeps coming up quot power surge on hub port quot quot usb has exceeded the power limits of the hub port quot my computer is working </s>
<s> i checked the ports i figured when my son fell against the printer it broke the usb port in the back </s>
<s> it does seem a little loose or something </s>
<s> but i check the ports and the signal switches from one port to another </s>
<s> i only have two things hooked up on usb ports </s>
<s> i unhooked the camera the camera works fine </s>
<s> on the system try the printer picture is there and it says ready but when you go into the dialog boxes it comes up disconnected </s>
<s> so obviously i think i damaged the usb port into the printer </s>
<s> if this is so is it something one can install on their own </s>
<s> i m not huge computer wiz but have fixed quite a few things on my own </s>
<s> is this an expensive problem </s>
<s> has this error done damage to my computer that i can t see at this point </s>
<s> it s not burning out the motherboard is it </s>
<s> mine never made and sounds when i unplugged it and plugged it back in </s>
<s> i ve restarted reset things tried to reset the ports not happening </s>
<s> i was just wondering if it is only the usb port on the printer itself if it was a situation i could handle myself </s>
<s> any advice or experise on this printer </s>
<s> oh yeah </s>
<s> my computer is a hp pavilion 503n and i m running xp on it </s>
<s> the printer is an hp 2110 psc all in one </s>
<s> thanks for any help </s>
<s> if i can save money and do it myself please let me know </s>

<s> if you may notice a too similar discussion at in fact was top of my list here noted a way to turn that off </s>
