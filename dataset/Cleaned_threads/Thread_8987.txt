<s> i inserted the card in my pcmcia slot but no hardware wizard came up and the light isn t blinking </s>
<s> is there a problem with the driver or the card or the pcmcia slot itself </s>
<s> from an os that someone installed and forgot drivers to a bum port or cards </s>
<s> the story here is too light to point to any but the usuals </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> is there any way to fix it </s>
<s> the driver is a texas instruments pci 1410 cardbus controller and i have the newest version installed </s>
<s> i am working on an acer aspire 3003wlci laptop with a 1 8 ghz amd mobile sempron processor and i m looking to connect a canon elura 100 camcorder </s>
<s> i hope this helps </s>
<s> i dropped the hint about the os install </s>
<s> is it stock or did someone install xp </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> it s a stock install </s>
<s> all the drivers should be there because i recently had problems and used my restore discs </s>
<s> some dell s require more than what drivers they supplied </s>
<s> not only the pc card chipset driver but a motherboard driver package </s>
<s> we also can t tell if the card is dead or not </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i m running on an acer aspire 3003wlci laptop </s>
<s> like i said when i tried to update the driver it said i have the newest version </s>
<s> i tried also to download some drivers from techgear s website but i don t think that they were to run the device they were just add ons for more features </s>
<s> you write quot stock install quot but one owner had installed quot xp quot from a retail cd and called that a stock install </s>
<s> is this laptop ever had the os reinstalled </s>
<s> by who </s>
<s> how </s>
<s> if acer s install then i m calling the card dead or incompatible </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> acer had xp installed when i bought the laptop last year </s>
<s> the only quot reinstallation quot was when i used the restore discs from acer that came with it </s>
<s> exchange it for another make </s>
