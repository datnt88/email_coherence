<s> im looking at buying a amd i see the athlons are more expensive then the semprons but are they that much better </s>
<s> thx </s>
<s> if its only for basic word processing surfing the net instant messaging email etc </s>
<s> then the sempron will do fine </s>
<s> and it depends if u get the low end athlon 3000 or 3200 there probably wont be much difference between those and the semprons </s>
<s> however when u go higher there is definitely a difference </s>
<s> alot of photoshop how much difference when you go higher then 3000 or 3200 </s>
<s> these days my low end is the amd athlon 64 3500 </s>
<s> price is good </s>
<s> if the budget is not so tight my preference is a dual core cpu </s>
<s> if you are going to do gaming and photoshop then the sempron or low end amd will not help you there </s>
<s> i agree that a dual core cpu is the best way for you to go </s>
<s> if you can t go dual core i suggest you get an amd 64 3500 or a 3700 </s>
