<s> i currently have a compaq presario 6420nx specs op sys win xp processor amd athlon xp2200 1 8 ghz memory 256 mb ddr sdram hard drive 80gb 120gb added </s>
<s> i would like to add another 256 mem stick </s>
<s> does the new stick have to match the current system 2100 or can it be a 2700 </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the pc will always work at the lowest speed compatible with the memory you have </s>
<s> so if you have 2100 and 2700 it will work at 2100 speed </s>
<s> i am not sure what the price difference is between those two </s>
<s> but i would recommend spending a little more for higher speed so you can use that for the future as well </s>
<s> in two years you probably dump that 2100 bcus it would be so outdated </s>
<s> you will still be able to keep the 2700 in two years though </s>
<s> you can check out whosave com maybe they list some 2700 on sale </s>
<s> actually the 2700 is significantly cheaper somewhere in the range of 40 and the 2100 was 60 </s>
<s> that is what spurred the question </s>
<s> so if i hear you right i could dump my 2100 and just get two new 2700 256 sticks </s>
<s> you might want to visit it seems your 2100 is in the 40 buck range </s>
<s> you could do the mix match thing and see what happens </s>
