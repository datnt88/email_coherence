<s> i am new to mac computers i am used to pcs </s>
<s> my daughter gave me an old ibook from 2001 that has an airport card in it </s>
<s> it uses 802 11b wireless </s>
<s> i would like to upgrade it to 802 11g wireless </s>
<s> is this possible </s>
<s> if so do i need to buy the expensive apple airport card or is there another brand i can use </s>
<s> thanks for any info </s>
<s> get the apple card and be happy it just works without much ado </s>
<s> try another card and if it glitches then you get to sort it out </s>
<s> the other makers just don t get it about mac support so that s my advice since you have an apple </s>
<s> consider that with the older ibook you may not realize any big gain in speed </s>
<s> then again bob </s>
<s> that ibook will only take the airport 11b original card and does not have the physical connections or space for the 11g airport card </s>
<s> there are a number of usb wireless adapters out there but as bob pointed out their performance can be a little short of steller </s>
<s> i don t think that any major speed gain would be made by spending extra cash on an external wireless card for this device </s>
<s> i think you will find the speed adequate for normal web surfing and email p </s>
<s> a pc card slot is needed for any 802 11g card i ve found </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> unfortunately the ibook does not sport a pc card slot so if there is any upgrading to do it would have to be via the usb connector </s>
<s> here are three i found just now </s>
<s> i have not done any research as to their compatibility with os x or os 9 but the devices do exist </s>
<s> given that the ibook is usb 1 0 the speed gain would be negligible </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> usb 1 is 11 megabit and 802 11b about the same </s>
<s> the pipe is full </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> yes they did mention on one site that you would see greater speed increases with usb 2 0 but did not say why </s>
<s> sneaky </s>
