<s> i recently upgraded from 2k to xp pro and all was well for awhile </s>
<s> the system started getting slower and slower and would lock up at times </s>
<s> i would have to hit reset to get back up </s>
<s> i ran all the necessary scans on the system and found nothing </s>
<s> after a few more lockups i took it to my shop thinking i had bad memory </s>
<s> changed to new memory and no change </s>
<s> when turned on one time i heard a quot pop quot in the area of the ps </s>
<s> installed new ps and no change in system performance </s>
<s> ran the windows task mgr and under performance saw that cpu usage would spike to 95 most of the time and i had nothing running </s>
<s> i disconnected the network cbl and the usage dropped to 5 max </s>
<s> everything worked fast again </s>
<s> put cbl back in and i was back to the same bad performance with 95 cpu usage when nothing was running </s>
<s> i have reinstalled the xp upgrade several times with no change </s>
<s> thinking it might be the 10 100 adapter on the mobo i put in a pci card and disabled all the other adapters </s>
<s> same problem </s>
<s> i am at a total loss here </s>
<s> any help would be great </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> i can t find any make or model in your post </s>
<s> i can t find if you installed drivers that microsoft won t either </s>
<s> sorry if i missed it but could you fill me in on what i couldn t find </s>

<s> all the drivers for the asus a7n8x e video card and more </s>
<s> just installing xp sp2 is not enough </s>
<s> downloaded the nforce 5 10 update from asus site </s>
<s> seemed to only update the audio drivers </s>
<s> saw on another site that this update would quot update quot the whole mobo </s>
<s> not sure what the video card has to do with it </s>
<s> the network worked ok before this problem started and the video card has not changed </s>
<s> but let s not talk about system idle process and it s 95 </s>
