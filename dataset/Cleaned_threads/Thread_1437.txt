<s> hi all i m hoping i can explain what we are trying to do without sounding like a complete idiot </s>
<s> doubtful </s>
<s> we have a wireless signal in our house that comes through a service provided router </s>
<s> the troubles come when we try to get internet to our shop which is separate from the house and a couple hundred feet away </s>
<s> we have tried a wireless repeater with no success </s>
<s> my husband ran cat5 such that you can have a wired connection in the shop but we cannot seem to get a wireless network to work through this connection </s>
<s> at my disposal i have the service provided router a linksys wireless g wrt54g v8 and a uspeed wireless n wi fi repeater access point range extender </s>
<s> any help would be most appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> google how to use a router as a wap and place that at the remote location </s>
<s> i find repeaters to be too hard on folk </s>
<s> for example the speed drop is bad enough but will folk place them in the correct locations </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i hadn t tried this yet but will do so </s>
<s> thanks for the suggestion </s>
