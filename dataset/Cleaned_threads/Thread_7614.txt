<s> hi i have a new to me 6 months old computer </s>
<s> it was built by a friend of a friend </s>
<s> it has a asus mainboard and as i say the main drive shows as removable hardware </s>
<s> it works fine i m just worried i accidentally hit remove device </s>
<s> would i then be in loads of trouble trying to start my pc also i would like to know why it shows like this </s>
<s> many thanks j j </s>
<s> look in device manager gt harddrive gt properties gt policies </s>
<s> if there two choices available there try opimize for performance </s>
<s> this may make the drive disappear from the tray </s>

<s> hi bob thanks for your answer </s>
<s> i have checked as you suggested and it is already set to quot optimize for performance quot so no good </s>
<s> but is this a thing with sata drives </s>
<s> should i just ignore it </s>
<s> thanks jj </s>
<s> i won t define what those are since you can research such but since it can be so it could be removable </s>
<s> look around for any checkbox with the word quot removeable quot for that drive </s>
<s> bob ps </s>
<s> not an issue so far just annoying to some </s>
<s> windows will not install on a device that it thinks is removeable </s>
<s> it can be fooled into doing so but then i would question the legality of the install </s>
<s> you typically have to install it onto a fixed drive then clone that onto a removeable drive </s>
<s> i had hoped that simple research about esata would be fine here </s>
<s> this is a new area and predates xp so xp could label it as removable </s>
<s> this is not a registry error </s>
<s> it s an option </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> wow complicated eh </s>
<s> i will just put up with it and be careful not click on quot remove hardware quot for that drive </s>
<s> thanks everybody though </s>
<s> your choice here </s>
<s> there is no bug it s just something that is related to the new sata interface and you can fix it if you want </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks think i m just going to leave it alone </s>
<s> j j </s>
<s> no version of windows will install from official media on a device that windows detects is removeable </s>
<s> it matters not if it s usb or firewire or esata or scsi hot plug </s>
<s> if windows detects the device is removeable it will not install to it </s>
<s> that s an immutable fact </s>
<s> so the install could have been done to a fixed device and then somehow migrated to the removeable device </s>
<s> that s why i question the legality of the install </s>
<s> also hklm system currentcontrolset enum registry entries contain device descriptors which identify the characteristics of a drive </s>
<s> this is done so drive capabilities don t have to be fully re enumerated when booting </s>
<s> an error or manipulation in the registry can make a fixed drive appear to be removeable </s>
<s> copying an install from one drive to another can have the same effect </s>
<s> hi i think i got what you are saying i m not knowledgeable about computing but i have looked inside the pc and it is all connected up in the normal way and it is a fixed hard drive the os xp pro is legal and updates via microsoft </s>
<s> but if as you say a copy has been copied from one drive to another it s still a hard drive and not removable </s>
<s> please forgive me if i m sounding stupid to you but i am in the land of fog mud and whats that burning smell at the moment but many thanks for your responses </s>
<s> j j </s>
<s> that here we have windows installed and the boot drive is marked removable as it s in the tray </s>
<s> i ve seen this often with xp sata connected drives and windows installs just fine </s>
<s> vista seems to understand sata much better and will not mark the boot drive as removable </s>
<s> after a few hundred installs you just gotta wonder what is immutable and what is not </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for your comments bob i m just going to leave all alone </s>
<s> many thanks jj </s>
