<s> i recently had a new hard drive added to my computer </s>
<s> the old drive was left in as a slave drive and a new installation of windows xp home sp2 was installed on the new drive </s>
<s> the first thing i did when i got my machine home was to make sure windows was totally updated </s>
<s> since then none of my usb devices will work </s>
<s> when i plug any of them in the computer will make the usual quot bling blong quot sound but nothing else happens </s>
<s> it makes the usual quot blong bling quot sound when i remove a device </s>
<s> i am currently using well attempting to use a microsoft wireless optical mouse 2 0 a brother mfc 5440cn and a tv tuner device </s>
<s> none of them work at all </s>
<s> i tried to go into the device manager and update the drivers on the usb controllers but windows was unable to find an updated driver </s>
<s> so i uninstalled the devices and re booted the machine </s>
<s> i then went into the device manager and updated the drivers on the quot unknown devices quot that were there </s>
<s> this worked and windows successfully installed drivers for all six entries in the device manager </s>
<s> however after rebooting i am still having exactly the same problem </s>
<s> there was no change at all </s>
<s> all of the drivers for the hardware are up to date and have been installed uninstalled and reinstalled </s>
<s> i am running out of options </s>
<s> does anyone have any advice </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i have a p4 2 5g 750mb 160gb with windows xp home sp2 </s>
<s> microsoft doesn t install drivers for all this plus there may be some motherboard driver package that needs installing </s>
<s> try to remember how you installed windows last time </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you probably need to install the mobo chipset specific drivers </s>
<s> visit your mobo mfg s website or your chipset mfg website and you should be in business </s>
