<s> hey guys i just moved to a new apartment where i m surrounded by a lot of businesses that offer free wifi access </s>
<s> my question is can i just latch on to their connection s and say goodbye to my isp </s>
<s> what it comes down to is i don t need a land line or cable tv i just want high speed internet as cheaply yet ethically as possible </s>
<s> is this feasible and what kind of equipment do i need </s>

<s> while inaccurate in my book that usually gets the finger pointing at a shelf full of choices </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> safest way is to get your own internet service </s>
<s> it will also be more convenient and you can make the service calls to the isp when there is trouble </s>
<s> some cable dsl and other broadband internet services are getting cheaper </s>
<s> some entry level services are as low as 14 95 month </s>
<s> if you do use wireless hotspots or share someone else s service with permission you computer will need a wirless network adapter </s>
<s> many newer notebooks ship with an internal wireless adapter </s>
<s> if yours doesn t you can get a pc card or external usb wireless adapter </s>
<s> get a wireless g 802 11g compatible adapter for high compatibility </s>
<s> wireless g is compatible with wireless g and wireless b networks </s>
<s> you can get a wireless a g adapter that is compatible with a b and g networks </s>
