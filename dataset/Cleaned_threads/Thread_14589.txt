<s> hey everyone </s>
<s> i m looking for a nas system </s>
<s> i really don t want a noisy external hd in my room on at all times next to my sony vaio laptop so i m looking at a nas for my home network so i can leave it on downstairs and access it anytime </s>
<s> i ve been looking tirelessly at the options reviewed by cnet but can t seem to find the right solution </s>
<s> i want something that can accept a 250gb ntfs filesystem for importing video i pass that 4gb mark after 18 minutes of recording has a rj45 port for my router as well as firewire usb connections for a direct connection to my laptop if i need additional speed or the network stops working can be accessed via ftp if possible so i can access my nas anywhere the challenge is to find something that can accomadate all this </s>
<s> does anyone have any idea what i should consider buying </s>
<s> qqrdz1qqcmdzviewitem this 300gb nas drive seems to meet almost all my wants but the fat32 hd can t be converted there must be something out there like this that supports ntfs </s>
<s> the guy selling it also seems to get a lot of complaints about the nas systems he sells so i don t really want to buy it </s>
<s> first the problem with fat32 is that the maximum filesize is 4 gigabyte </s>
<s> for our office our first nas was given away due to that limit </s>
<s> next the real issue came home is even at 100 megabit the transfer rates are quite slow </s>
<s> your average usb 2 0 is some double to quadruple that speed </s>
<s> the internal drive double or more than again </s>
<s> see the slowski s commercial </s>
<s> with a little google you can find other nas with the better linux or ntfs file systems and maybe you can more to gigabit network speeds to cure the speed issue </s>
<s> i now have the dlink nas but the speed issue is still there until we upgrade the network switch to gigabit speed </s>
<s> in closing i think you ll be disappointed even if the filesystem is fixed </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i see thank you for your response </s>
<s> if speeds are an issue i may have to live with an external hd in my room </s>
<s> speed is important when i import from adobe premiere so i may have to live with a noisy hd in my room </s>
