<s> i read some information on this from 2005 but believe my situation is a bit different </s>
<s> i boot and it seems if i have the side panel off the machine and the windows in my house are open the computer will keep running most of the time </s>
<s> so i figure it is a heat issue </s>
<s> sometimes it will go for hours without shutting down and then the next time i boot it up it will run for 5 minutes and shutdown </s>
<s> and i mean instant off </s>
<s> when it does this and you reboot the system it doesn t do a check disk which i find really strange it will start up normally </s>
<s> i am kind of taking the lack of the check disk function to mean the issue isn t with the hard drive </s>
<s> it is to cold here to have the windows open today so i have the side panel off the system and have a fan blowing on the motherboard </s>
<s> so far so good </s>
<s> but from the previous posts am wondering if my ram could be failing or my power supply which i believe is 350 watts either or both should be changed </s>
<s> i don t want to spend to much money on this as it is my hope to pick up a 17 quot laptop within the next few months </s>
<s> i do have old machines with good power supplies so was thinking of swapping </s>
<s> i have changed a mother board years ago but have never changed a power supply so don t really know what to look for regarding compatibility </s>
<s> i am running an acer pentium 4 3 06 ghz with 1 g of ram xp pro thank you for any suggestions you might have </s>
<s> does it normally shut down after playing games or while doing something cpu intensive </s>
<s> what video card are you using </s>
<s> is your system an acer or is it more of a clone </s>
<s> what motherboard is in the system </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> 1 heatsink compound </s>
<s> replace it on the cpu and if there is a chipset heatsink that is removeable do that too </s>
<s> about 2 to 20 bucks </s>
<s> 2 inspect for bad caps see google </s>
<s> cost </s>
<s> zero </s>
<s> 3 remove that second hard disk and second cd dvd drive </s>
<s> this frees up watts and costs nothing </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i will look into each suggestion further </s>
<s> but the stop gap measure that i tried seems to working and indicates an overheating problem </s>
<s> i have the side panel off the unit and have a fan blowing directly on the computer </s>
<s> it has stayed on for 12 hours or more at a time </s>
<s> i can see where these forums are a big help for those of us who are a bit mechanically inclined </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> sheila </s>
<s> helps significantly in reducing heat a common cause for spontaneously rebooting </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> to add and free remove anything that s near the system to let the air flow freely both front side and back </s>
<s> keep it above the ground also cost free </s>
