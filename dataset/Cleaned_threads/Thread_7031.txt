<s> i recently purchased the microsoft wireless desktop set </s>
<s> wireless comfort edition wireless comfort keyboard 1 0 wireless optical mouse 2 0 the keyboard has been excellent </s>
<s> the mouse on the other hand is a different tail </s>
<s> i have updated the mouse drivers </s>
<s> i have also tried to contact microsoft both via phone and email with no help </s>
<s> the email did not work because they don t have my model on the hardware list </s>
<s> strange but okay </s>
<s> the left click works when it wants </s>
<s> i have tested the right click and mouse movement with no problems </s>
<s> the left click will work after about three times of pressing it </s>
<s> what i want to know is anybody else encountering this problem with any of the new wireless mice available from microsoft or did i get a bad pick </s>
<s> sounds like you have a bad mouse </s>
<s> microsoft keyboards and mice most always work well with a microsoft os </s>
<s> check device manager and see what it says your mouse is </s>
<s> also check to see if you have other mouse drivers loaded on your computer if you do remove them </s>
<s> i did check that but after careful review to the problem i found out my wireless routor s signals were the actual problem </s>
<s> interference </s>
<s> could not beleive it funny huh </s>
<s> thanx again </s>
