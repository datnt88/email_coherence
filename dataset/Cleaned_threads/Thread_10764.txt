<s> i have an ibm scsi internal hard drive that i use on a mac running os 9 my computer can no longer read the hard drive </s>
<s> whenever i boot up the computer it will crash if the hard drive is installed </s>
<s> when it is not installed it boots up fine </s>
<s> the hard drive came with an adapter that i think may be the cause of the problem </s>
<s> is this a common problem that can be fixed by purchasing a new adapter </s>
<s> below is all the information on the hard drive label type dghs comp iec 950 ece32284 pn59h7013 sn 6810a623gk emc p n 072 000 123 11s59h7013zm1fv110a623 9808 please let me know if you can help me with this situation </s>
<s> i ve searched the ibm web site but it appears they no longer have a support section for hard drives on their site </s>
<s> thanks for any help you can give me </s>
<s> you didn t write how old the drive is but i know that at about 5 years these drives are at the end of their lifespan and to replace such if need be </s>
<s> i see 20g hard disks of similar model for the 30 buck range on ebay </s>
<s> sounds like a cheap fix </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the date on the drive is august of 98 and we bought it on ebay approximately a year and a half ago </s>
<s> the problem is we need to salvage some things on the drive here at our business and we re trying to figure out a way to do it </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> sorry to hear that </s>
<s> try what you can but the lesson never seems to end does it </s>
<s> remember that most drives are quot 5 year designs quot the short and long of this is that they make terrible places to keep what we can t lose </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> well fortunately our most important stuff was backed up </s>
<s> it s just some minor stuff we d like to recover that we want from it </s>
<s> thanks for you help though </s>
