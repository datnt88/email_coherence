<s> hi guys gals don t ask me why but what i am trying to do is have two network connections on my pc one wired and one wireless balance internet requests based on type </s>
<s> they each have local static ip addesses </s>
<s> for example my wireless connection 192 168 1 11 is my default it goes to the web as my default connection </s>
<s> what i would like to do is use this in most cases but say when i am attempting to get an mp3 file for example the wired connection is used </s>
<s> environment windows xp pro i know this may seem silly to do but i was hoping there were some great minds out there that might have some ideas on how this could work </s>
<s> also the ability to do this at the application layer would be ideal </s>
<s> changing a bunch of windows settings can be tedious and would need repeated on each different machine </s>
<s> either way i am open to any ideas or suggestions </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> mind you are probably using windows so that means the only adjustment you can make is to establish a route to one or the other network based on the ip address </s>
<s> tell me you understand routing and then we ll move to the next step </s>
<s> this will never quot bond quot the 2 channels </s>

<s> hi bob yea i know a bit about ip routing </s>
<s> what i can t get my mind wrapped around is intercepting the http get requests and being able to change the interface it goes out on </s>
<s> i read a good deal about quot bonding quot and not sure if thats what i am looking for </s>
<s> i want to be able to effectively choose which interface i use on each request </s>
<s> most talk about bonding or this type of thing leads into a reply with you should just by a better router with load balancing </s>
<s> i am not looking for this </s>
<s> i want to write an application that filters the request and chooses an interface based on the content type </s>
<s> i appreciate your fast response </s>
<s> let me know what you think </s>
<s> thanks nick </s>
<s> we can only establish subnet the internet to give differing routes for which subnet we wish to send it to which gateway </s>
<s> if you want to bond the interfaces you can t do it native </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thats alright i dont really want to bond them </s>
<s> i want to create some sort of nat one that lies on the client side and chooses which interface to use </s>
<s> do you have any suggestions </s>
<s> ics routes and such </s>
<s> the nat we do with ics is only going to thoroughly dismiss what you asked to do in your first post </s>
<s> gt so is subnetting the internet going to accomplish your goal </s>
