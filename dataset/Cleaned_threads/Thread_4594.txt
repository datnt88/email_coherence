<s> i bought and installed a belkin 802 11g router in january and i still get dead spots in my 1600 square foot apartment </s>
<s> i think i need a range extender or expander but those seem to cost more than the router i purchased a few months ago </s>
<s> plus they all seem to have difficulty with the set up and being a novice i dont think i could get it to work </s>
<s> any easier solutions or are there expanders that are fairly simple to set up and use </s>
<s> or get a newer better router </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> things like moving the router to a central and or open location </s>
<s> sometimes just moving its location around can help </s>
<s> side note if you use a wireless phone many are on the same frequency 2 4 ghz which will knock you off because of interference </s>
<s> thanks i bought 5 3ghz phones so i dont think that is the problem </s>
<s> doesnt my router need to connect to my desktop via a cable </s>
<s> yes your router need to connect to the desktop if that desktop doesn t use wireless </s>
<s> no if your desktop use a wireless </s>
<s> place the wifi accesspoint somewhere in the middle of the room preferably high look out for any interference such as cordless phone microwave baby monitor etc including your neighbour s try to make a better antenna gt freeantennas com </s>
