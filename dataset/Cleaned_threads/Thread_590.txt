<s> i want to upgrade my 1ghz processor </s>
<s> any recommendations </s>
<s> soemthing around 100 maybe a pentium 4 between 2 and 3 ghz </s>
<s> also need to know how difficult simple this is </s>
<s> i ve done quite a few upgrades that were all easy plug and play </s>
<s> is this the same </s>
<s> that means you likely have a p3 </s>
<s> to upgrade to a p4 you need a motherboard or hold the p4 new power supply since it s quite hungry and the ram changes too </s>
<s> with all the heat a new case is fitted </s>
<s> if you were to stick with the p3 it s unlikely any real gain of moving to the 1 2ghz would be worth it even if your old machine could support it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> so is it worth the trouble of going p4 </s>
<s> i don t have the money to get a new pc </s>
<s> i ve already upgraded to 512 ram bought a new dvd burner 160mb external hd and 2 0 usb pci card </s>
<s> so i m pretty much at a point of no turning back to buy a new pc </s>
<s> if i could upgrade my processor i d be good for a long time and have saved some cash </s>
<s> so mother board power supply and the processor i understand but you say i need a new tower case </s>
<s> that s sound like some work transfering everything over or did i misunderstand </s>
<s> information needed to create an informed recommendation cpu socket type gt memory type gt motherboard mnf </s>
<s> gt vendor or custom case </s>
<s> p s wattage </s>
<s> upgrading the cpu does not automatically increase the speed of the system </s>
<s> the clock rate data buss address buss memory type are all factors in overall system speed </s>
<s> bill </s>
<s> neither of them told you the cost of what your talking about a 3 2ghz pentium 4 is 220 w o mobo or anything </s>
<s> well i think most of the items you mentioned you will be able to use them in your mobo except a few </s>
