<s> can any point me in the direction of a computer reseller that allows you to quot build it yourself quot offering the new intel chip q9550 </s>
<s> intel directed me to their resellers however these people were quot distributors quot and not pos computer providers </s>
<s> the distributors needed you to become one of their quot resellers quot to get any information </s>
<s> i don t want to resell computer parts i just want to have one built to my specifications </s>
<s> this new chip is suppose to utilize intel s new txt technology </s>
<s> i plan on using new desktop for rending graphics cad texture creation and manipulation animation graphics creation </s>
<s> this new technology needs a special motherboard as well one recommended was dx35bt </s>
<s> they are referred to extreme technology </s>
<s> any help providing me with an online quot build it yourself quot computer company that provides this technology would be appreciated </s>
<s> if i have to build it myself i still need a supplier for quot one quot cpu </s>
<s> many thanks for your time </s>
<s> would like to run on xp if possible i also posted to computer help </s>
<s> if not today tommorrow </s>
<s> goto and use their links for cpu sources </s>
<s> provided you can wait newly released cpus tend to be expensive </s>
<s> plus more vendors will provide them thus competition forces pricing into more sensible levels </s>
<s> good luck tada willy </s>
<s> look for a motherboard with the socket that matches the release </s>
<s> none i checked actually had the product to sell you </s>
<s> most indicated out of stock will arrive soon or taking preorders </s>
<s> my advice let the product s get to the stores read the tech reviews read buyer reviews and then decide which components are right for your system </s>
<s> i often use newegg com for peripherals and they re a great source for product selection product description buyer reviews competitive prices reasonable shipping and good customer service </s>
<s> the link below is a great example of a new high priced cpu from intel and it appears there are some peripherals to avoid </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
