<s> hi i m having some real problems with my soundblaster pci128 i had problems installing it initially and it was all down to the pci legacy device that it was trying to install </s>
<s> eventually it just didn t install the device and since i don t use it it wasn t missed </s>
<s> i rejigged the guts of my pc yesterday and moved the soundcard to a different pci slot </s>
<s> it redetected on windows load and it locks up mouse keyboard everything as soon as it detects the soundblaster pci128 legact device i ve removed all references in device manager and rebooted same problem </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> try booting up into safemode and go back to device mgr </s>
<s> go to the sound category click the plus mark if it s not already opened up right click the legacy device and choose properties </s>
<s> once there look for the box that says disable in all hardware profiles and put a check mark in it </s>
<s> click ok and then reboot to see if the problem persists or if it fixes it </s>
<s> toni </s>
<s> thanks for the advice but i already removed the legacy device in safe mode so it no longer exists </s>
<s> i did however disable the soundblaster s main driver in safe mode then rebooted and attempted to enable it </s>
<s> it detected the legacy device again and hung the system </s>
<s> any other ideas </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> i ve seen that hangup when the motherboard drivers were not installed </s>
<s> when you dive into such issues the make model of the motherboard is important </s>
