<s> hi my computer has been infected with a virus for awhile now and it s affecting overall performance </s>
<s> i m throwing to much money into anti virus programs that aren t doing the job </s>
<s> i need to to scrub the hard drive and start over fresh </s>
<s> can you recommend a product that can be effective and information on operating system installation </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> most computers either come with a set of disks to recover your computer to out of box condition or has a feature to make a set of recovery disks to correct problems just like yours </s>
<s> they also have a d partition on the hard drive that has a recovery program </s>
<s> there are several free programs such as rkill malwarebytes superantivirus and others that don t cost anything except the price of a blank cd and the time to run them </s>
<s> there are free antivirus programs you can download and run just google quot free antivirus programs quot and choose one </s>
<s> some isps will give you free antivirus programs just for subscribing to their service </s>
<s> in my case i am with comcast and they supply norton 360v5 at no charge </s>
<s> did you create or order the restore media first </s>
<s> and there is no need to toss money at this </s>
<s> consider what grif writes at link gt bob </s>
<s> no matter what recovery operation that is used won t effect the data that s stored on your saved media if they contain the virus and you return the virus again back to a just recovered pc </s>
<s> in other words once you re certain the pc is clean then run the av pgm </s>
<s> against any offloaded stored media to scan and cleanse them as well </s>
<s> here s what i do when all else fails and get the go ahead to do a total wipe out or cleaning </s>
<s> using dban or killdisk totally wipe clean the hd </s>
<s> once done using the recovery discs to return the pc back to day 1 or the day those back ups were created </s>
<s> do a full os reload any drivers and then os updates from service </s>
<s> install or run the av pgm </s>
<s> after its own update to check and verify the pc </s>
<s> finish the pc recovery by installing at that time any pgms </s>
<s> not reloaded or user supplied </s>
<s> if you have data return it to its proper directories </s>
<s> if all this is from ext </s>
<s> hd or flash drives these have already been av scanned otherwise you may introduce the virus back again </s>
<s> don t take anything for granted scan to check </s>
<s> lesser infections may not need a total rebuild as it were but the quot time and effort quot usually become just as long or intensive </s>
<s> sometimes you re reward for shortcuts is finding out you really didn t remove the virus </s>
<s> however if the infection is known and following any online posted help many times allows an user to continue in good health </s>
<s> afterwards be careful of how you possibility got infected in the 1st place maybe some email loaned disc borrowed ext </s>
<s> media or p2p access like torrent etc tada willy </s>
