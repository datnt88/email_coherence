<s> i have a dell vostro 1500 and i have at t wireless internet in my house </s>
<s> my other computers and roku connect with no problem but mine even though it says it is connected is not connected </s>
<s> i have windows xp the other computer is vista and the desktop is also xp </s>
<s> even at t came over the house and said something is wrong with the computer </s>
<s> can anybody help me </s>
<s> what makes you think it is not connected </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> because you cannot connect to the internet </s>
<s> does the connection icon happen to say something about quot limited or no connectivity quot if you hover your mouse above it </s>
<s> in that case it looks different from how it normally looks when there is a full connection </s>
<s> two related things to check 1 does the router management page show it as connected </s>
<s> what ip address </s>
<s> 2 what does ipconfig run it from the command prompt exactly say about the ip address of the pc the gateway and the dns </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> yes it says it is fully connected </s>
<s> it looks like it is connected to a old network that does not even work </s>
<s> i can t figure out how to get it to connect to the correct one </s>
<s> go into your wireless configuration utility </s>
<s> remove that old network </s>
<s> only keep the networks you need in the right sequence </s>
<s> xp comes with a standard program for that </s>
<s> however quite a few makers add their own on top or as a replacement </s>
<s> so i can t tell you how it works on your pc </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks but how do you do that </s>
<s> i have been trying but it keeps on popping up </s>
<s> for the initial setup of the password for the connection </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thanks but now i have a new problem </s>
<s> i am getting a stop error message </s>
<s> a blue screen i can t get passed when the computer starts up </s>
<s> it will not even let me go into the safe mode </s>
<s> now i am really </s>
<s> what would cause this happen </s>
<s> i never seen a computer with so much problems </s>
<s> my others are hp s and even though they are not perfect they are next to this </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> two questions 1 what did you change to get into this condition </s>
<s> 2 what s the error number something like 0x0000005e or so on this blue screen appropiately called a bsod blue screen of death </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> thank god i was able t fix it i had to relaod the os from the disc </s>
<s> now i have to figure out how to get this computer to connect to my network </s>
<s> it is brand new and i cannot even find the wireless connection </s>
<s> in your other thread my colleague grif suggested loading drivers from another cd </s>
<s> and you mentioned something about using a dell disc to load the os to an hp cd </s>
<s> so you should mention much more detail on what exactly you did </s>
<s> maybe better start a new thread in computer help because clearly this is as you already stated yourself a new problem </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> hi i actually found the disc for the dell </s>
<s> i was able to get the computer up and running </s>
<s> i have a network 1394 for high speed and lan </s>
<s> i went to hardware devices and that is the only thing i see for network devices </s>
<s> i have three other discs </s>
<s> one is for the web cam one if for cyberlink and one is drivers </s>
<s> but this is something i noticed late last night before i was ready to throw the computer against the wall </s>
<s> it seems like the power cord is connected to the problem </s>
<s> could that be possible </s>
<s> i noticed that if i moved the laptop just a inch the wireless light came on for a second and if i took the cord out the screen got lighter not darker </s>
<s> i cannot hold the cord in the in place to keep the wireless light on </s>
<s> but i could see the wireless lights and the other lights on the side of the computer go off and on </s>
<s> my original cord went kaput and i got a new one not a dell one but from amazon which stated the cord was compatible </s>
<s> it seemed to work fine </s>
<s> this problem with the wireless is new </s>
<s> this computer is not my main computer but one i let my roommate use </s>
<s> he has been having a hard time getting on the internet this is what started this whole thing </s>
<s> but i think it now is because something is up with the power cord </s>
<s> also when the blue screen came on it said it could be because a loss of power </s>
<s> it seems the cord is ok just to turn the computer on and to charge it but it has to be moved around for the wireless light to come on </s>
<s> could that be it </s>
