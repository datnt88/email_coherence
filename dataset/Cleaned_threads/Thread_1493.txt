<s> i have just recently built a pc epox mb intel p4 1 8 g 512 mb pc2100 ram </s>
<s> the power supply seems to be working fine and no problems booting or running </s>
<s> however i have noticed that even when the pc i shutdown the case seem warm where the power supply is located </s>
<s> i have built several other pc before but have noticed the heat build up </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> first check your caps lock </s>
<s> all capitals is considered screaming </s>
<s> any way you didn t say what power supply you have </s>
<s> even now case makers put an undersized 300w unit in most cases </s>
<s> even worse they are rated at 300w they usually actually far below that for a modern machine 400w is considered as a desirable minimum if you want to avoid heat problems and lock ups associated with them </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> let me see if i understand </s>
<s> you run the machine for some period of time and then you shut it down </s>
<s> then you run your hand on the case and find the psu area of the case to be warmer than the rest of the case </s>
<s> i would think that is normal the psu is putting out some serious heat and it has to go somewhere </s>
<s> i have not taken the power supply out yet to look at it i will take a look it is suppose to be a 350 watt power supply the actual concern is i can have the computer off all night and in the morning the area where the power supply is is still warm </s>
<s> thanks for the feed back so far </s>
<s> the atx supply can power a lan card keyboard mouse or other circuits to effect a startup on such </s>
<s> as such the power supply will produce some heat </s>
<s> nothing s really wrong yet </s>
<s> tell more </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the feed back </s>
<s> i thought that might be the case although my 2 other machines do not feel warm </s>
<s> that takes care of this one thanks again out </s>
