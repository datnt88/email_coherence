<s> i m hoping some of you can help me </s>
<s> i currently have a logitech mx revolution mouse and i m about to throw it through a wall </s>
<s> it constantly stutters and freezes while i m playing simple computer games </s>
<s> i ve tried uninstalling the software to see if that helps and the problem still persists </s>
<s> i ve done a lot of research and i m at a loss at what mouse i should try next </s>
<s> i really like the ergonomics of the revolution which i think means i prefer a palm grip </s>
<s> i also like the cordless factor but i m not completely opposed to a corded </s>
<s> i ve been looking at gaming mice like the x8 sidewinder the logitech g5 g9 microsoft habu and the razer death adder but i m not sure if the gaming mice would be overkill for me </s>
<s> the sidewinder seems like it may be too big for me i m a woman from reviews but i like the wireless aspect </s>
<s> the razer mamba is the only one i can find that can switch from wired to wireless but paying over 100 for a mouse that has a lot of features i ll never use seems silly to me </s>
<s> i do not play any hard core games but i would like to get through a game of luxor without slamming my mouse out of frustration </s>
<s> i have been looking at mice using a laser tracking system because i don t like to use a mouse pad and use it directly on my desk wood another reason the sidewinder seemed like a good choice due to the blue track system but i am afraid of the size </s>
<s> does the dpi or wireless capability have anything to do with the problems i m having or is it just the mouse </s>
<s> i would really like a mouse with the same ergonomic build that doesn t have the problems i ve mentioned </s>
<s> i have a new computer with plenty of ram large hard drive and dual processors so the computer is not the problem </s>
<s> any advice would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> hmmm i would highly recommend using a mouse pad and specifically a wow pad they are designed for use with optical and laser units </s>
<s> some of the issues you have been having could be created by the surface and light refractivity </s>
<s> i would also recommended using a mousepad that is designed for the type of mouse you get </s>
<s> some are only good for optical and some are only good for laser </s>
<s> aside from that i do have some expertise in the mouse division </s>
<s> if you like the revolution you will probably like the similarly shaped logitech g5 </s>
<s> it s a solid mouse with plenty of features </s>
<s> dpi switching is great and the weight cartridge is a little gimicky but is great if you re picky about weight </s>
<s> if you want something really cool the g500 will be coming out which is basically a super g5 </s>
<s> note that just because you like the revolutions grip you do not necessarily have a quot palm quot grip </s>
<s> you know you have a palm grip when you don t even squeeze the sides of the mouse with your fingers to move it because your palm is on top of it </s>
<s> if you do have a palm grip you can probably use one of the sidewinder mice </s>
<s> it s not really that much bigger than the g5 length wise but people feel like it is because of the height on the back </s>
<s> if you rest your whole palm on top of the mouse you will be fine unless your fingers are child like small </s>
<s> it sounds like you don t need a lot of slick macro features and rediculously high dpi engines so i would recommend the g5 </s>
<s> mice have changed alot in a few yrs </s>
<s> because of that they too are becoming another task the system has to service </s>
<s> a std </s>
<s> ps2 mouse just didn t have so many problems </s>
<s> now add if or wifi and batteries etc you get the picture </s>
<s> as others suggested get the required pad for better operation </s>
<s> understand that during gaming intense pc usage is at hand even for simple games that s fact </s>
<s> your mouse being yet another device may falter under such conditions </s>
<s> a simple usb may help as being physically connected loses many of the if or wifi issues </s>
<s> further they re cheaper and or tend to work in all aspects of what many users want just being cabled is the holdout </s>
<s> now decide tada willy </s>
<s> thank you to those who replied </s>
<s> i got the wow pad today and i cannot even believe it my mouse is working perfectly </s>
<s> knocks on wood love this pad b c it is super thin </s>
<s> i don t particularly like using a mouse pad to begin with but with this one it is so thin and large that i hardly notice it except the mouse glides much easier on it than on the desk </s>
<s> i never even thought that would be a problem b c i was under the impression that laser mice worked on any surface except glass </s>
<s> i have a wood grain desk and thought that would be fine </s>
<s> i also went to best buy to try out some mice and the logitech g5 was my favorite fit next was the g9 </s>
<s> did not like the razer mice way too flat for me </s>
<s> they did not have the sidewinder to try and they also did not have the mice out of the packages so i had to feel them in the plastic </s>
<s> staples had them out but had none of the mice i was interested in </s>
<s> i probably don t even need a new mouse now thanks to your great advice but if i do i will probably stay with logitech </s>
<s> perhaps i ll wait for that new one that was mentioned to come out to have a good corded mouse on hand should anything happen in the future as far as the palm vs claw grip i did some research on what each is and mostly hold my mouse in a palm grip but i did notice that for some games that need greater more precise movement i pull my palm up slightly and use my fingers more </s>
<s> i see they call that the fingertip grip </s>
<s> i suppose i actually use both grips depending on what i m doing and i do not use the claw grip at all although i also found some people consider the fingertip grip and claw grips to be essentially the same thing my fingers stay pretty flat which is why i think it s probably not considered a claw </s>
<s> well thanks again everybody </s>
<s> your help was greatly appreciated </s>
