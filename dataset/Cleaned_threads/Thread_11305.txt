<s> if i have two 150gb drives in raid 0 can i mirror them to just one 500gb drive or does it have to be a raid 0 1 or 1 0 set up with two drives in raid 0 and two drives mirroring them in raid 1 </s>
<s> 1 raid 0 is not a mirror </s>
<s> that s striping </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> quot two 150gb drives in raid 0 can i mirror them to just one 500gb drive quot well 2 times 150 is 300 here </s>
<s> how did you get to 500 </s>
<s> 3 all this raid stuff is confusing to new owners </s>
<s> why not make your choice and quot do it quot </s>
<s> you could setup the mirror via the os vista or xp pro but you d be losing the speed of the existing striped volume </s>
<s> all onboard raid controllers that i know of would require 4 drives for a 1 0 setup </s>
<s> 1 i never said raid 0 was a mirror </s>
<s> the question was is it possible to mirror a raid 0 array onto just one drive or does it have to be four drives in raid 0 1 or 1 0 </s>
<s> 2 these are the drives i have already </s>
<s> i understand that 300gbs is less than 500gbs </s>
<s> it is not really relevent to the question so long as one of the drives is large enofe to mirror the size of the smaller two together </s>
<s> 3 i asked the question so i would understand a little more about the subject so i could make a better choice on witch way to go </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> it s now clear you are not using english </s>
<s> let s say you have an existing raid 0 you want to convert to raid 0 1 </s>
<s> there is no documented method to do this because you have no details from what raid controller you are using today </s>
<s> if it is possible your documentation must tell you how </s>
<s> do not guess </s>
<s> read the fine documents and if you don t see it then it doesn t offer such </s>

<s> thank you this is just what i wanted to know </s>
<s> sounds like i should put the two 150s in raid 0 and use the 500 for the os and media files like music </s>
<s> just have to remember to make a back up every week or so </s>
<s> this will be a hardware raid </s>
<s> i am building a new game computer and have been looking up alot of things that iv never tryed before </s>
<s> my next questions will be on overclocking </s>
<s> i dont know enofe about it to have a question yet </s>
<s> maybe soon </s>
<s> thank you very much for your reply </s>
<s> it helped alot </s>
<s> the question was is it possible to setup a 0 1 with only three drives two in raid 0 and one in raid 1 with the first set </s>
<s> it is now clear to me that this is not possable </s>
<s> i do thank you for your replys </s>
