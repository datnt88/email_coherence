<s> i got a 1tb seagate expansion drive around 3 months ago for my eeepc laptop and it s made soft clicking noises that don t exactly match the ones on datacent com </s>
<s> the ones on mine are way softer and can t be heard over an electric fan on full blast </s>
<s> then again my hearing s never been the best </s>
<s> i take generally good care of the hard drive haven t dropped it always have handled it with care though i have tripped over the cord connecting it to the electric socket several times </s>
<s> my room s stuffy though just in case that turns out to be important </s>
<s> as this probably means trouble i ve decided to just buy another hard drive </s>
<s> i m a first time user so i don t feel like i want to touch another seagate hard drive with a ten foot pole now </s>
<s> am i being too much </s>
<s> any good ones out there preferably 1tb </s>
<s> what brands would you recommend </s>
<s> i m a no frills kind of person so i ll be happy with simple functional storage space without any fancy features </s>
<s> also i m thinking of switching to linux xp user here maybe in a few months or so so i d prefer something that s linux compatible too if that s possible </s>
<s> one of the new features of hard drives that produce a soft clicking is the drive performing a surface scan on its own </s>
<s> this is proving to upset owners today </s>
<s> and all the makers are implementing it </s>
<s> i fear that another drive could do the same </s>
<s> you can research this if you like but i am on travel so have to keep it short </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you google away and find the results are few for many ext </s>
<s> hds out there of the actual hd installed </s>
<s> the makers of hds are seagate owns maxtor wd samsung and hitachi and that s it </s>
<s> i exclude any laptop installs or such </s>
<s> you can try to search for a different brand but the installed hd will be one of the above </s>
<s> nope </s>
<s> any movement of the hd while on is a negative action regardless of past use history </s>
<s> often enough imho heat is the main cuplrit of damaging ext </s>
<s> hds as they usually don t have active real good heat dissipation other than thermo ally metal hd case and whatever ext </s>
<s> case suited for this task </s>
<s> in other words no fan or huge heat sinks </s>
<s> also usb ext </s>
<s> hds getting power from usb port can tax that usb current output and can cause damage as it hits the limits but to each pc is different </s>
<s> next the ac powered ext </s>
<s> cases are prone to what the outside world has to offer </s>
<s> any sags or surges of ac current will more directly effect the ext </s>
<s> hd as usually no protection is provided </s>
<s> last just because you turn pc off doesn t mean you turn ext </s>
<s> hd off when ac powered </s>
<s> it sits there powered on maybe idle but cooks under its own heat build up </s>
<s> psssst my cat sits on mine i have to shoo it away </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> quot automatic off line read scan to monitor additional operations quot this is noted about today s hard drives </s>
<s> this read scan is causing some folk to think the drive has a defect </s>
