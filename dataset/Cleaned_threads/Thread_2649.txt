<s> i currently have a raid 0 formation but because of a drive failure want to just install a single 1t hdd </s>
<s> i ve cloned all the data etc with acronis to the new drive and hope to just swap out the old and install the new </s>
<s> will the pc recognise the single drive or will i have to go into the bios and disable the raid set up </s>
<s> since its a clone you can plow ahead and try it </s>
<s> however it is a data drive so i take it from your post that no os is at issue here </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the os was cloned as well it should just be like putting a complete disc in i ve done the same on laptops and other pc s but they didn t have a quot raid quot configuration </s>
<s> if the common ones research this on google about repair after the changes </s>
<s> xp repair install vista repair install sadly with all the variations of raid chips and more the only answer is to try it and be ready to try the repair installs </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks but with it cloned it should just boot up hopefully </s>
