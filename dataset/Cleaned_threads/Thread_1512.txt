<s> i m currently using a 45 dollar teac all format dvd recorder </s>
<s> there is some issue that dvd players don t play recorded media some will do dvd r some like dvd r and some play both </s>
<s> i had to add a field to my contact list as to which type to send them </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> sure a double layer is not needed for that file size but since they are getting cheap im planning to get them unless there are bigger problems with them </s>
<s> i mean the only difference is the size of data that the disk will hold right </s>
<s> adolfo </s>
<s> but i expect you to find that sending a double layer to friends and family to result in a better than 50 reduction in who can play it in their dvd players </s>
<s> just my advice </s>
<s> buy the recorder if you want but send out the single layer media bob </s>
<s> you need a good media use branded one and a very good burning software </s>
<s> some softwares will not allow you to view the recorded clip in normal household dvd players while others have slides or errors in it </s>
<s> just an added information </s>
