<s> i am trying to install the third internal hard drive inside my sony vaio computer case </s>
<s> there are only two bays for the hard drives </s>
<s> there is enough space for the third one though </s>
<s> does anyone know what kind of brackets i could use to install the third drive </s>
<s> is there a site i can purchase a bay for one drive or some kind of hardware which will hold the drive in place </s>
<s> thanks a lot </s>
<s> alex </s>
<s> bay down to a 3 1 2 </s>
<s> if so go to search for item 161 0410 that s it </s>
<s> i am looking for additional bay for the third drive </s>
<s> are you aware that a hard drive can be mounted in any orientation </s>
<s> on its side upside down </s>
<s> seems that if you have space mounting should just take some kind of a kludge </s>
<s> of course getting the ribbon cable to it with another drive on the cable may be a real challenge </s>
<s> just tape the thing under the lowest harddrive bay </s>
<s> it ll work fine _ </s>
<s> of kluge variation of spelling lol but you posted it as a reply to me </s>
<s> your reply was actually intended for the originator of the post i believe </s>
