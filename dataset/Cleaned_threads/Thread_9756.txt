<s> i have a asus mobo p4s533 with a p4 2 o ghz cpu </s>
<s> couple of weeks ago i decided to overclock the cpu to run at 2 3 and it worked fine </s>
<s> now the other day i unplugged all the wires from the back of my computer and connected another computer </s>
<s> few hours later i plugged all the wires back to my computer </s>
<s> one minute after i did this a sound and smoke comes from what seemed to be the power supply 250w meanwhile i never even turned on the computer </s>
<s> assuming the psu was bad i purchased another one 400w and replaced it </s>
<s> when i power on the computer the cpu fan spins for a quarter of a second and nothing else happens no beeps or anything </s>
<s> so next i examine the cpu and find out that two pins on the cpu are bent </s>
<s> there is a green light on the mobo that is on when the power chord is plugged in </s>
<s> does anybody have any suggestions to what the problem is </s>
<s> is it the cpu the mobo both or anything else </s>
<s> how did the pins get bent on the cpu when it is locked in the socket </s>
<s> why did smoke come from the psu when i did not even turn on the computer </s>
<s> i know its a lot of info but any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> i m surprised no one told you that 250 watts was well on the low side of what over 1ghz machines should have </s>
<s> live and learn i suppose but you ll have to be aware that it s time to consider all the parts that were in the machine to be quot suspect quot </s>
<s> the last machine i witnessed do that took out everything except a modem and the fans </s>
<s> the modem dies a few months later </s>
<s> never overtax a power supply </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> i did not realize that 250w is below the recommended power </s>
<s> live and learn i guess </s>
<s> but how could the psu have damaged all the other parts when the computer was not even on at the time when i seen the smoke </s>
<s> only the power chord was plugged in </s>
<s> they supply power to the standby power leads for functions like wake on lan </s>
<s> you may be less than enthused that the design takes the ac line rectifies it ac to dc and at that stage you have over 200 volts dc </s>
<s> any number of component failures or a screw falling inside i ve seen pennies paper clips etc can cause this voltage to travel to what is connected to the psu </s>
<s> rare but not unheard of </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> there is always a current running through the motherboard because the power switch plugs into the motherboard </s>
<s> there are large capacitors in power supplies which makes them very dangerous if opened by the way </s>
<s> somehow the capacitors could have unloaded into the computer which would fry everything instantly check into the power supply warranty you might be able to get everything covered </s>
