<s> i have a desktop with 2 drives a c which shows up as windows and is 50gb and a d which shows up as data and is 1 8tb </s>
<s> i was told that everything would automatically go where it was supposed to go </s>
<s> however when i tried to save a programme it defaulted to c drive the computer said i did not have enough space on the drive </s>
<s> it said i needed 15gb and i only had 13 gb </s>
<s> when i go to my menu i see that just about everything is on c drive and my d drive is just about empty </s>
<s> can i just decide to save everything to d or can i rename d to c and what do i do when things automatically want to go to c can i just change this to d if necessary will have to get a technician in but i m hoping someone can give me hints </s>
<s> i back up both drives on an external drive </s>
<s> thank you june </s>
<s> but i ve never found this to be automatic </s>
<s> i never suggest a small c drive unless the owner is very pc savvy </s>
<s> it s far too much to ask new owners to cater to such a setup </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> you can t rename d to c bob </s>
<s> with 2 partitions like quot c quot and quot d quot </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> yes there are definitely 2 drives </s>
<s> the c drive has 59 gb and that is the one that is nearly full </s>
<s> the d drive has 1 8 tb and that is the one that is nearly empty </s>
<s> thanks june </s>
<s> as most systems have only one hdd sometimes split or partitioned into two or more logical drives </s>
<s> but if you re sure there are 2 separate physical drives mounted internally the options are to replace the smaller hdd and image the smaller hdd to it </s>
<s> or you could image the smaller drive c to the larger drive and use the 1 8tb hdd as your internal hdd </s>
<s> personally i like the idea of two internal hdds as i use the 2nd hdd solely as a backup to the 1st hdd </s>
<s> with a second drive mounted internally backups and restores are quick and easy </s>
<s> external hdds are ok but usually less reliable as you can see from reading in this forum </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
