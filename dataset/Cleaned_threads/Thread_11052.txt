<s> hi all im near to the end of my a course and also research alot about hardware engineering on the web being quite confident about it and fixing pcs for family and friends to get practical experience i decided to upgrade my own pc and came to a prob i just cannot sus </s>
<s> current pc make up operating system microsoft windows xp home edition os service pack service pack 2 directx 4 09 00 0904 directx 9 0c motherboard cpu type via c3 800 mhz 6 x 133 motherboard name epox ep 3vwm motherboard chipset via vt8601a apollo ple133 system memory 631 mb sdram display onboard graphics via tech vt8361 vt8601 graphics controller 8 mb 3d accelerator trident cyberblade i7 monitor hansol 720e 17 crt 0000000000 storage ide controller via bus master ide controller floppy drive floppy disk drive disk drive maxtor 6e040l0 40 gb 7200 rpm ultra ata 133 optical drive hl dt st cd rw gce 8520b optical drive lite on dvdrw ldw 851s upgrading to mercury atx pt800 mainboard pentium 4 3ghz radeon 128mb agp x8 card same os same optical drives same hard drive i installed the above by the book and powered up for the first time and had no display on the monitor and no post beeps everything else appears to have powered up ok at first i thought does the new graphic card need configuring through the bios setup utility </s>
<s> but cant do that if i have no display on monitor after spending a lot of time on this problem with no avail i just reinstalled my old pc </s>
<s> i could hear the hdd spinning but im not sure if it would load windows xp because its configured to my other mainboard im not sure if you can take a hdd with os on it to another pc and the os would load as the chipsets are different between boards as for the graphic card its a ati radeon 9250 128mb agp x8 with tv out my old set up has 285w psu and i knew that it wouldnt be enough for the new mainboard etc so i bought a sumvision ky 500atx 400w psu </s>
<s> i have refitted the new set up about 4 times now without avail i been looking up other forums and speaking to certified engineers soon be certified myself some of them say that the board itself may be at fault so replace it but i aint got the dosh to go out and buy another one why should i replace it when the board was bought new in september and i have stuck to all the guidelines regarding electro statics etc it should be ok any ideas why i had the above problems </s>
<s> advice appreciated cos im sick of working with a 800mhz cpu thanks marc </s>
<s> xp should not boot with that motherboard change </s>
<s> installing the os proper is my fix but you can research this further at google com with these words </s>
<s> xp change motherboard bob </s>
<s> its known that you would not need to re install xp if the chipsets the same on each board but im not that worried about re installing the os im very used to that </s>
<s> im more concerned that i dont have any display on my monitor no post beeps and i think no bios dunno cos i cannot see i even took the brand new agp graphics card back to the shop and exchanged it for a different brand name i have came to the conclusion that the agp slot on the board is at fault even though the board is brand new all else seems to be powering up eg optical drives hard drives keyboard and mouse just have no display </s>
<s> i did take anti static precautions before touching anything inside the case suppose i will just have to stick with 800mb cpu power until i get a new p4 board my brother in law is gonna give me a shot of a spare pci graphics card to try so if that works then the agp slot is at fault for sure </s>
<s> if you re past the 30 day return then send it to manufacturer for replacement </s>
<s> if it s not even posting then the os doesn t mean anything </s>
<s> i just had an asus mobo come in dead at the stick </s>
<s> no problem exchanging it </s>
<s> also had another asus go bad after 6 mo </s>
<s> again no problem exchanging it </s>
<s> it took a couple of weeks but hey you re now in the league of diyers and that s a price you sometimes pay </s>
<s> it s inevitable sooner or later you re going to get bad stuff </s>
<s> you may have got it sooner is all </s>
<s> before you send it back tho make sure you plugged in all the power cables to the mobo and that they re in tight </s>
<s> do you fedex or ups </s>
<s> and life goes on jack </s>
