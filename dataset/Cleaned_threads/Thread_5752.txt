<s> i already have my os as well as other software programs installed on my western digital hdd </s>
<s> i doubt it s possible because all the software is already installed on my current hdd but i would like to add another of the exact same western digital hard drive in conjunction with my current hard drive to create a raid 0 or stripped system </s>
<s> does anyone know if this is possible and if so how i would go about it </s>
<s> my second question about a raid 0 system is if it is possible to backup all its files onto an external hdd </s>
<s> does your raid system support such </s>
<s> most don t </s>
<s> item 2 is a software issue </s>
<s> i think acronis is quite good </s>
<s> as bob say make sure your system supports raid </s>
<s> here s what you can try </s>
<s> enable raid on your mb s ports that support it and install the proper drivers on your current hd and make sure they show as functioning properly </s>
<s> next make a complete hd image using software capable of doing such on another hd and preferably one that will restore from dos </s>
<s> put your two wd drives on the raid channel boot and create the array as you desire </s>
<s> once the array is created connect the hd with the full image on it to the system and restore that to the raid array </s>
<s> set the array as the first hd in the boot order and fire it up </s>
<s> if all goes well it will start just fine but windows could be unhappy about the hardware changes and require re activation </s>
<s> if all doesn t go well you still have the full image available to restore as it worked before </s>
<s> as for your question about backing up to an external that should work fine </s>
<s> a raid array is seen as a single drive and has a single drive letter </s>
<s> what you probably cannot do is back up a full image to an external and restore it to a non raid drive </s>
<s> the boot loader will be configured for ata sata and will not have the raid drivers at boottime even if they re installed in the os </s>
<s> if raid 0 is enabled on the motherboard it will erase the partition tables of the existing drives </s>
<s> sweet </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i m kinda a computer noob though </s>
<s> how would i create a complete hd image using capable software and what are some examples of the software i might use </s>
<s> you can enable raid on the mb and xp will see the new hardware and allow you to install the driver </s>
<s> this differs from trying install xp on an existing array where you d need to pre install the drivers from a floppy </s>
<s> with the raid drivers already installed you can create the array and move the os over to it </s>
<s> now i have done this with raid 1 on an sata set but not raid 0 i presumed it would work either way but could be mistaken </s>
<s> that company has been absorbed by the evil symantec corporation who has their own product called norton ghost </s>
<s> that would probably do the job </s>
<s> another popular one is acronis true image </s>
<s> i have no experience with it but it should work also </s>
<s> after rereading here your best bet might be to do a clean installation on a pair of new drives of the same model </s>
<s> personally i d never consider raid 0 anymore than i d jump from a plane without a second parachute but that s your choice </s>
<s> that you re looking for backup advice is a good thing </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> just installing the os level drivers won t change the bootloader s drivers which are part of the master boot record </s>
<s> so when the image is applied to the raid volume xp won t boot since the bootloader will be using ata sata drivers not the vendor specific raid driver </s>
<s> raid 1 is often transparent to the os since the controller makes 2 drives look like 1 but striping and raid 5 always requires a low level raid driver since 2 drives are being merged </s>
<s> and striping cannot be enable without having some drives to stripe </s>
<s> once enabled the controller will clear the partition tables on the striped drives </s>
<s> i d never consider raid 0 for my own use unless going for a speed record with the intention of donating what s on it to the data black hole </s>
