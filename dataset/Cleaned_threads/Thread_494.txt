<s> i am running a sony vaio pcv rx650 winxp_sp2 nvidia tnt 2 64 pro gpu with 32mb s of on board ram 512mb s of system ram 80gb hd with 68 gb free space </s>
<s> just wondering if anyone could help me out with this dilemna </s>
<s> would greatly appreciate it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> for example the hidden administrator account default no password you only see on the safe mode welcome screen </s>
<s> things like this are exactly the reason why it s recommended to have 2 admin accounts available and reachable on a machine </s>
<s> if one is corrupted that could be the case here you can use the other to make a new one transfer files and continue as if practically nothing had happened </s>
<s> of course if the corruption is on a deeper level this won t help </s>
<s> kees </s>
<s> only one administrator account </s>
<s> but problems occurs with all accounts created on machine </s>
<s> never read anything on that </s>
<s> thanks for input will remember for future reference </s>
