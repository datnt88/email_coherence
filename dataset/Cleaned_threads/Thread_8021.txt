<s> your post is very light and for most desktops we can use many models </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi i don t care about the model but want a comparable replacement </s>
<s> what is recommended </s>
<s> i would be guessing if this is just another pc power supply </s>
<s> i had hope you could tell more </s>
<s> i know i know that some folk want to replace with the exact models but in your common pcs we have some standards </s>
<s> if you would share a bit more then i could see if a stock supply will do </s>
<s> there are some hundreds on newegg com that would do but if you would tell more such as the dimensions and connections it would go a long way </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> someone can help </s>
<s> is that the exact name power tek or is it powertek </s>
<s> if that s a serial number we need a model number </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> does it look like if so why not another standard pc power supply </s>
<s> bob yes the sample you provided at the link is the exact model atx500d but i see it is unavailable </s>
<s> i am a novice at this stuff but i know the one i have now is shot and i can replace it myself </s>
<s> jim </s>
<s> your old psu is nothing more than a generic atx type psu </s>
<s> finding a similar one with be fairly easy as most vendors offer this at 500w unit </s>
<s> just be sure the connections offered basic are what you need and added connections are provided as well though you may not need them they cause no harm </s>
<s> again look for typical generic atx 12v type psu </s>
<s> usae robert s link for any specs and or pictorial help </s>
<s> tada willy </s>
<s> lucky for us we found your old supply </s>
<s> there must be some thousands of models that will work in it s place </s>
<s> gt but let me add that before you replace it inspect the motherboard for bad caps as your parts are in the time frame of the bad caps days </s>
<s> google bad caps for the pictures and stories </s>
<s> finally add 100 more watts so we re sure there is more reserve and you won t be replacing it in a few months </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks to all that provided assistance </s>
<s> i found what i needed and did increase 100 watts to 600 happy holidays </s>
