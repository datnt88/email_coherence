<s> is will we be able to store several pc s files on one drive </s>
<s> or will it write over what is put on previously </s>
<s> i was thinking big because i am hoping we can store info for our 5 pc s </s>
<s> thanks in advance bikerart </s>
<s> data from those pcs as they are now and give enough extra space for what you might accumulate in the future </s>
<s> then consider what you stand to lose when and not if that big drive fails </s>
<s> as for overwriting previous data that only happens if you copy new files with the same names as existing files in folders on the drive and you will be asked first </s>
<s> files aren t removed in rollover fashion as the disk fills </s>
<s> thanks for the reply </s>
<s> is it possible to partition the drive so we can put 4 different pc s on there </s>
<s> there are bound to be files that are the same between all those pc s </s>

<s> i use clonezilla </s>
<s> i didn t read any manual or documentation and am able to store images of machines to such a drive with a single partition </s>
<s> i find partitions to vanish on folk so i shy away from that advice </s>
<s> but if you feel it s the answer go for it </s>
<s> the cnet storage forum is testament to how we can t trust hard drives and more so external hard drives so make plans for backup and don t let it be the only place a file could be found </s>
