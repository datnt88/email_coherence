<s> hi there i have a issue with my new pc </s>
<s> i have install 64 bit windows 7 but it did not detect my 2 4 gb g skill ram instead it only use 4 gb of it </s>
<s> when i recently upgraded my laptop from 2 x 2 gb to 2 x 4 gb it didn t detect either one </s>
<s> i went back and noticed that i hadn t pushed the little suckers in all the way even though i thought i had so i pushed them in with more force more than i had expected and rebooted </s>
<s> it could be that one of your might have the same problem </s>
<s> if that s not it i ve read that sometimes there s a bios setting you have to tweak although i ve never personally seen it </s>
<s> since you say it s a new computer i don t suppose there s a 4 gb hardware limit but i d check that just to be sure </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> we cover a lot of ground including a setting that limits the os to 4gb as well as using the bios to see what the pc sees before windows starts </s>
<s> what does the bios show </s>
<s> and before you answer windows will never show more than what the bios shows </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you upgrading </s>
<s> have you tested both dimms in the same slot </s>
<s> could be a defective dimm or a defective dimm slot more info needed for more help </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
