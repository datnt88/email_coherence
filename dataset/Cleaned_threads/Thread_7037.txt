<s> i am interested in subscribing to a for hire vpn service that allows me to safely surf the net at hotspots </s>
<s> i ve looked into the services offered by witopia net and hotspotvpn com </s>
<s> does anyone have opinions about either of these services or suggestions about one that works for them </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> that s not right </s>
<s> how could this be </s>
<s> have them explain it </s>
<s> i m not buying this one </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> 30 day moneyback guarantee and under a current promo it s only 39 50 a year </s>
<s> witopia and the others only offer 128bit encryption </s>
<s> hotspotvpn offers up to 256bit aes encryption </s>
<s> hotspotvpn works with macs the others do not </s>
<s> hotspotvpn s is also easier to install 30 seconds max </s>
<s> there areno forms to fill out and no certificates requests to exchange after the purchase </s>
<s> hotspotvpn is also much more flexible with email </s>
<s> you are painted into a corner with the others </s>
<s> witopia s personalvpn works great with macs </s>
<s> my setup experience with hotspotvpn wasn t that smooth </s>
<s> perhaps they ve changed things or you re talking about their old pptp service </s>
<s> certificates are a good thing and hotspotvpn uses them just incorrectly they load both the public and private key on your machine together instead of keeping one secured yikes </s>
<s> not sure what you mean about email personalvpn works with any and all applications and mail packages as far as i know </s>
<s> actually they both are based on openvpn so ultimately it s the same service but hotspotvpn is about 3 times the price </s>
<s> and even more expensive if you want the 256bit encryption that you don t really need </s>
<s> also why do they charge more for higher encryption how does that cost them more or is it a sales gimmick </s>
