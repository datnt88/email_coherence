<s> hi so i have 2 computers </s>
<s> a laptop and a desktop but the laptop can connect to the internet just fine no crazy stuff attached </s>
<s> cool but when i head towards my computer i see a 3 2 bar connection both the laptop and desktop are in the same room and no drivers are giving a huge red light </s>
<s> also when i plug in a rear end network adapter it seems to do nothing to help its range </s>
<s> huh both computers run windows 8 pictures laptop s wifi imgur the simple image sharer my desktop s wifi in the same room imgur the simple image sharer laptop s drivers imgur the simple image sharer desktop s drivers imgur the simple image sharer also if you would like to help me with another mystery the desktop wouldn t pick up the wifi connected printer downstairs or the headphones right next to the bluetooth adapter </s>
<s> pics bluetooth imgur the simple image sharer printer imgur the simple image sharer thanks </s>

<s> what type of a hook up are you using </s>
<s> hardware isp etc </s>
<s> i am using century link as my isp not sure what the laptop is but ik my desktop is a gateway xd4780 and as for my back adapter don t know what its called but it looks like this </s>
<s> that screw on to a socket </s>
<s> the picture s seem to be of the wireless antenna </s>
<s> if it is possible for you to do hardwire to the router via an ethernet cable this would be a much more efficient hook up than wifi </s>
<s> as far as printers or peripheral devices proximity and impediments walls doors etc </s>
<s> can play a major role in defeating wifi signal </s>
<s> bluetooth is an entirely different ball game generally requiring a bluetooth dongle not the same as wifi </s>
<s> yeah digger that is the antenna that came with that model desktop it is obviously unplugged from the system unscrewed and of course is non functional in that position </s>
<s> from what i saw of the other pic alluding to bluetooth no hardware found i am not sure what he is using for a dongle or what the configuration is but as you know bluetooth doesn t recognize wifi </s>
<s> it just wasn t effecting my wireless connection one bit </s>
<s> have the antennas screwed on to the wireless network adapter </s>
<s> if you have very weak wireless signal using the onboard adapter with the antenna then as i suggested if the router is near enough to the desktop hook it up hardwire this is a far better way to go </s>
<s> you could buy a usb input wireless adapter that might help but again impediments things in the way can block the signal to your unit from the router </s>
<s> hardwire hook ups are always superior to wireless especially in a desktop application </s>
<s> its like the computer doesnt see the adapter </s>
<s> windows 8 installed or did you recently install it and if so did the wireless adapter work ok with the previous os </s>
<s> from the pictures you sent of device manager it shows your wireless adapter no errors are shown </s>
<s> have you tried updating the driver </s>
<s> or deleting it rebooting and seeing if that would do the trick </s>
<s> i was under the impression that it was working but with weak signal results maybe i missed something </s>
<s> i had done a full computer wipe reinstall windows which after that has seemed to go bust after installing the lastest driver </s>
<s> have windows 8 previously </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> loaded the original os with the original disc s the drivers should be correct </s>
<s> i am now in pure hardware inside the computer and noticed that both wires to the wireless adapter is unconnected when i tried putting them near each other i get so its definately those 2 wires thanks for the help everyone </s>
