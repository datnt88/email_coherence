<s> i am looking for a 2 1 system and i like the klipsch promedia 2 1 now my question is has anybody ever hooked up bookshelf spreakers or any other speakers to this system </s>
<s> if so how did it sound </s>
<s> i have two jbl62 speakers laying around that have a 6 quot woofer and a 1 quot tweeter and probably are better than the klipsch satellites </s>
<s> how well would this work </s>
<s> i ve got a pair of 62ts connected to my main stereo amplifier but in a basement room </s>
<s> i d rate them as ok but not terrific </s>
<s> my primary speakers are an old pair of jbl l65 jubals bought in the 70s </s>
<s> they make the 62ts sound like a budget boom box from walmart </s>
<s> believe it or not i also have a set of klipsch promedia 2 1s connected to my pc </s>
<s> i think there is more than one version of these </s>
<s> mine have a black and orange plastic oval near the bottom that says klipsch thx </s>
<s> if you have these same speakers i d say leave them alone </s>
<s> i wouldn t consider trying to connect them to the satellite wiring </s>
<s> they work well with the sub woofer </s>
<s> i don t see what a couple more small woofers are going to add and i also doubt that the signal from the sub woofer would be properly equalized to power other low frequency speakers </s>
<s> i doubt that s what you re looking for but can t offer much encouragement here </s>
<s> they are just called jbl62 exactly thy are older but today i just bought the promedia 2 1 and my left satellite distorts around half volume </s>
<s> i m also finding out that the sub can t take much at anything close to half volume </s>
<s> am i missing a setting or something </s>
<s> i m wondering if my jbl 62 speakers can replace the klipsch speakers so it doesn t distort on me </s>
<s> if so the obvious answer is to return them under warranty rather than risk losing it </s>
<s> if you bought them quot as is quot the distortion could be a blown speaker loose coil bad volume control potentiometer or something as simple as loose hardware inside </s>
<s> somethings you can find and fix this </s>
<s> replacing the satellites is going to mean cutting and splicing some wire and dealing with the volume controls for both the satellites and the sub </s>
<s> you d have to fabricate some method of doing this </s>
<s> i seriously doubt that you ll get better sound from the old jbls than from a good working klipsch outfit </s>
<s> as for the sub woofer volume setting i run the dial no higher than 9 to 10 oclock or bass tends to get muddy </s>
<s> most all of these systems will do this </s>
<s> the extra power generated by its amplifier was never intended to allow you max out the volume controls </s>
<s> it s there for damping and such to improve the accuracy of the speaker by controlling its travel </s>
<s> i really like my klipsch speakers and hope you get your problem resolved </s>
<s> yes i bought the system new i will consider exchanging it for another after i try a few more things with it </s>
<s> thanks for your help and advice </s>
