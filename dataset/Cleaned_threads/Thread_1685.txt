<s> okay here is a puzzlement that i hope someone can help me with </s>
<s> i have a wifi router that communicates with one computer but not another </s>
<s> what is strange is my dv1432us hp laptop cannot quot hear quot the wifi a foot away but a desktop with a cheap usb wifi dongle in the back can communicate with the wifi router from the basement </s>
<s> i have tried turning off zone alarm no go </s>
<s> the ethernet wire out of the wifi router gives great internet connection to the laptop </s>
<s> the laptop wif works otherwise i can get wifi anywhere else including hotels and airports and even the next door neighbor when rcn poops out </s>
<s> so the internet wiring system is a rcn wire into a d link dcm 202 modem that runs a wire to a vonage phone router and that outputs to a netgear wgr614 v6 wifi router </s>
<s> my laptop runs win xp </s>
<s> and it used to communicate fine with the wifi router but hasn t for months </s>
<s> all i can think of is that i need to change the quot channel quot on the router </s>
<s> not skilled enough to understand that stuff </s>
<s> help </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> did you try some sub 10 buck wifi usb card to stand in or take over the work </s>
<s> well the laptop s wifi is ok with most every other wifi signal source it just won t connect up with my own wifi router </s>
<s> it s even weirder because my other desktop can link up with my router i am certain as it has a unique name and i can see the router s name in the laptop s wireless connections list but there is no data getting sent received between these 2 pieces of hardware both of which seem to work and play well with everyone else </s>
<s> i just can t figure this out </s>
<s> i like the faster wired connection but would be nice to be untethered once in a while </s>
<s> thanks jl </s>
<s> while it could be some forgotten mac filter issue i can t see that detail in this post </s>
<s> it sounds to me that if other wifi spots work then a new router will cure this </s>
