<s> hello i ve read some tips in other threads but i didn t see anything that specifically addressed or clearly addressed i m an intermediate computer person the following issue </s>
<s> i have two hard drives both sata </s>
<s> they both run at 7 200 rpm and are installed in the only two hard drive bays in the case </s>
<s> since these are the only two spaces they are one right on top of the other with a very small amount of space between </s>
<s> i just had a hard drive go bad and now that i m seeing the temperatures for the new one and the working old one idling at 47 and 52 degrees celcius respectively i think heat was a probably villain in the last one s demise </s>
<s> there s a large side fan over the cpu and the fan with the power supply </s>
<s> there are no additional built in spots for more fans </s>
<s> so i m struggling to find a way to cool them without disrupting the intended airflow </s>
<s> i had read somewhere that a guy rigged a fan using some foam tape so that it was pointed at the hard drives and blowing towards the front of the case </s>
<s> is that safe does that work </s>
<s> aside from that i really don t know what other options i have </s>
<s> a liquid cooling system is simply out of the question budget wise </s>
<s> any thoughts and or suggestions </s>
<s> take care chris </s>
<s> i had not given it much thought before but since you brought it up </s>
<s> a quick look at my hd temp shows 33 36c that s after multi hours of on use time </s>
<s> what happens if you remove the side panel </s>
<s> do you per chance have one of those micro mini slimline cases </s>
<s> 47c and 52c are pretty hot </s>
<s> best to check the mfgs site for thermal limits </s>
<s> i have two internal hdds and hdtune reports their temps at 24c 120gb and 25c 200gb </s>
<s> they re installed in a full tower antec sx1200 case in a removable drive bay that can hold up to 3 drives </s>
<s> the removable drive bay has a fan in the front that pulls air in and pushes over the hdds and toward the back of the pc </s>
<s> bottomline if your hdds are mounted so as to be right on top of each other it would help to separate them to the maximum practical extent possible </s>
<s> you could consider mounting one or both into a 5 25 quot mounting kits and moving them into 5 25 quot drive bays thats a real benefit of having extra 5 25 drive bays </s>
<s> there are lots of options it would help to see a pic if possible to see how your drives are mounted </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> from what i read it seems everyone was agreeing that removing the side panel was only effective if you then had a desktop fan flowing over the computer </s>
<s> even then it was mentioned that doing so is really bad for your computer due to the incredible amounts of dust that will build up inside on every computer component </s>
<s> it s not a slimline micro mini case </s>
<s> it s a medium size tower from medion german company </s>
<s> it only came with one hard drive i added the second </s>
<s> it also has a floppy drive a full flash dashboard any type can be loaded a cd rom and a dvd rw drive </s>
<s> that means that while there s some space below the hard drives there aren t any left over bays to use </s>
<s> western digital was saying that 55 degrees celcius should be the maximum temperature during full use </s>
<s> so it s definitely an issue that i m idling so hot </s>
<s> i don t really use the cd rom drive much it s probably worth ditching that to mount one of the hard drives there </s>
<s> i d do that but i m not sure if that will bring the temperature down enough as there still isn t much airflow over them </s>
<s> i think they built this with the capability of two drives but only enough space to keep one cool </s>
<s> i ll work on a pic </s>
<s> is there a way to post them </s>
<s> there s no room </s>
<s> a solution might be to take one hdd </s>
<s> out and put it in an external case </s>
<s> here s an inexpensive hdd cooler just need about 3 4 quot free space below the hdd to mount it for posting pics lots of folks use imageshack com how many 5 25 quot drive bays do you have </s>
<s> vapcmd </s>
<s> was just a test </s>
<s> if the test shows the hd s have cooled then you have an air flow issue </s>
<s> just an aside </s>
<s> the psu mounted at the top that came with this case blew it s hot exhaust air into the machine </s>
<s> i never understood that </s>
<s> anyway i spent a few bucks and bought a psu that moved the air in the proper direction seemed to cool the innards much better </s>
<s> as for dust </s>
<s> i ve run this machine with and without a side cover </s>
<s> can t say i ve seen a diff in dust build up </s>
<s> both methods still require a regular dust bunny clean out </s>
<s> alrighty </s>
<s> i got an inexpensive hard drive cooler similar to the one vapcmd linked to </s>
<s> the only difference is this one was on clearance at circuit city </s>
<s> there wasn t any space to mount it to the hotter of the two drives at least not below it </s>
<s> so i ended up moving the main drive to the bottom and the new drive to the top where i installed it upside down </s>
<s> then i took out the floppy drive above it </s>
<s> after custom drilling a couple of holes for the upside down drive i taped yes tapes the hard drive fan above it in place of the floppy drive since there was no way to screw it in anywhere </s>
<s> currently i m back up and running with idle temps at 28 and 31 degrees celcius </s>
<s> i m not sure if i m leveled out here or if the computer is still getting warmed up </s>
<s> if i m leveled out then this fan and new positioning did the trick as it s about 15 20 degrees cooler than before </s>
<s> my only question now is the hum i m noticing </s>
<s> it s basically a low hum and you can feel it pulsing if you rest your hand on the case </s>
<s> it s very low but i can t say that i ve heard it on any other computer </s>
<s> it started with the new drive being installed right side up so i m not sure what it s from </s>
<s> any ideas </s>
<s> you could move the hard drive to a 5 25 quot drive bay and mount the drive cooler and drive as designed </s>
<s> you could also mount a fan on the other hdd is desired </s>
<s> i think i might get into that once the semester ends the whole reason this was an issue is because my computer is for heavy video editing </s>
<s> so i needed a quick fix </s>
<s> however long term that idea sounds much better </s>
<s> thanks </s>
