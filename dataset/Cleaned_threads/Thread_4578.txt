<s> i have a dsl router modem actiontec m1000 from qwest </s>
<s> it has a wifi dongle bopper and a single lan port that i have connected to a tp tl r860 router to which i have connected all my hard wired devices </s>
<s> i need to be able to network the wireless devices connected to the actiontec m1000 and the wired devices on the tplink subnet </s>
<s> details actiontec m1000 with wifi dongle wan address assigned by pppoe irrelevant </s>
<s> lan address 192 168 0 1 wireless devices are on this 192 168 0 0 subnet </s>
<s> there is no way to assign ip addresses to specific devices i e </s>
<s> no dhcp reservations with this firmware </s>
<s> tplink tl r860 no wifi wan address assigned by m1000 192 168 0 2 lan address 192 168 1 1 hard wired devices are on this 192 168 1 0 subnet i can reserve dhcp addresses by mac address </s>
<s> questions 1 i need to allow the wireless devices laptops tablet on the m1000 network to access printers jetdirect networked hp 1320n and devices pogoplug roku desktops etc </s>
<s> i have added this route to the m1000 192 168 1 0 255 255 255 0 192 168 0 2 but cannot connect from the wireless devices 192 168 0 0 subnet to the wired devices 192 168 1 0 subnet </s>
<s> is it even possible with my configuration </s>
<s> if so what am i missing </s>
<s> 2 since i cannot assign ip addresses on the m1000 can i set the dhcp ip range to say 192 168 0 3 100 and set my tplink router with a static wan ip of 192 168 0 2 </s>
<s> so that ip is not assigned to another devices and mess up the m1000 routing table </s>
<s> would the m1000 be quot aware quot of this setting </s>
<s> can i add an entry to the routing table to make it aware </s>
<s> notes of some relevance i do not have the firewall or any security enabled on the tplink router </s>
<s> i have no problem connecting to the internet with any devices </s>
<s> i previously have set the m1000 as a transparent bridge and it worked fine and would continue to be so if not for the need of the wifi capability of the m1000 </s>
<s> the tplink router is wired only </s>
<s> i have considered disabling dhcp on the tplink router having it act like a switch and getting addresses from the m1000 but i sorta need static assignable addresses for my wired network </s>
<s> specifically for setting up a web server for roksbox and roku </s>
<s> and like i said the m1000 is not capable of reserving dhcp addresses with this firmware </s>
<s> just set the ip addresses manually </s>
<s> i can t hold the full class on ip networking here but even with dhcp enabled nothing stops you from setting the ip addresses manually on a server </s>
<s> as to no wifi on the tplink routers in my town start at 20 bucks so why not sell off that poc and get what you really want </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> i agree with bob </s>
<s> you can as you mentioned disable dhcp on the tplink </s>
<s> connect routers lan to lan not wan to lan </s>
<s> adjust the dhcp range on the actiontec and set manual ips on 192 168 0 x but outside the dhcp range on the devices that need it </s>
<s> all devices will then be on the same 192 168 0 x subnet </s>
<s> should be a straightforward setup with no new equipment if that s what you re after </s>
