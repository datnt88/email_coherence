<s> hey i m having a very annoying problem </s>
<s> just after windows xp pro launches on my computer the motherboard begins to let out one long annoying beep and it doesn t stop </s>
<s> i have no idea what is causing it and i can t get it to quit with the beep </s>
<s> it is really loud and makes it so i can t use my pc out of sheer frustration </s>
<s> what is the problem and how can i fix it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> you may want to remove the case cover to see if the fan is in place the airflow is good and the fan is not blocked </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> of course a real phone tech support type would probably just tell you to unplug the speaker </s>
<s> kidding just kidding </s>
