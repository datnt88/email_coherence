<s> ive been using my aunts macbook 1 83 core duo 512mb 667 ram os x 10 4 10 for a short time and ive noticed among other macs ive used that they are so unresponsive to my requests </s>
<s> i would have to say that i have seen the spinning umbrella a lot when doing ordinary things on the macbook but it seems so slow and unresponsive </s>
<s> i personally have a dell laptop with a pentium m 2 13 cpu and it runs much faster than this macbook </s>
<s> i know my notebook is faster in ghz but this macbook has two cores so it should multi task much better i would like to know why macs are so slow </s>
<s> is it the os </s>
<s> ram </s>
<s> something </s>
<s> this is something that would prevent me from buying a macbook because of its inability to respond quickly without halting or freezing a lot </s>
<s> are there programs that allow me to tweak the performance settings on a mac to speed it up faster </s>
<s> like i said if this could be fixed i would consider buying a mac but they are to sketchy is responsiveness at the moment </s>
<s> is the normal cause of the spinning colored wheel along with an over full hd </s>
<s> p </s>
<s> it was just fine </s>
<s> itunes launched fast and was great overall </s>
<s> filling up the hard disk could be an issue or having many apps open with so little ram </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> your use of one mac laptop has led you to this dumb statement go to a apple store or best buy or whatever and give them a try i know you have not been to my house to try mine give them a try i have four pcs and two macs </s>
<s> that wasnt very kind anyways my question is about how i can speed up a mac that is clearly slower </s>
<s> your mac may not be slow but you probably know more about how to alleviate those symptoms than i do </s>
<s> therefore i ask those that would kindly point me in the right direction as for those that can help me what causes them to be slow in the first place </s>
<s> i know much more about pc s and i am able to tweak a pc with various tools and cleaners to get it optimal </s>
<s> i do not know of many ways to speed up a mac and the like </s>
<s> if anyone knows more on this subject i would greatly appreciate help and not criticism on a subject that i am clearly trying to find the answer for </s>
<s> thanks in advance for your advise </s>
<s> as you have described the macbook you are using as only having 512 mb of ram i would suspect that this could be part of the problem </s>
<s> you say you re familiar with windows machines </s>
<s> how much performance would you expect from an xp or vista box with only 512 mb of ram </s>
<s> there are several things you could do to help keep your aunts macbook running smoothly </s>
<s> one of the major maintenance procedures is repairing permissions using disc utility </s>
<s> another would be to limit the amount of open programs you have running at any given time </s>
<s> another is to keep plenty of open room on your hard drive </s>
<s> bottom line however is the fact that you re not gonna get much from this computer with so little memory installed </s>
<s> btw do us all a favor and go back and reread your original post </s>
<s> telling folks that their computer of choice sux in their own forum informing us how much better a windows machine is complaining some more and then challenging us to persuade you to buy a mac is pretty unreasonable public behavior </s>
<s> i would suggest that if you really need help then asking for it politely next time will get you the quot kind quot response you seem to have been expecting </s>
<s> even a zoned in tranced out dude like you oughta know if your throw an elbow in the middle of a trip hop rave and smack someone then you oughta apologize instead of being surprised if you get elbowed back </s>
<s> ciao </s>
<s> grim </s>
<s> thank you for the response you gave me </s>
<s> as you ve mentioned about coming into a mac forum and complaining about macs and the like it was obviously not my intention to step on anyones feelings about their macs </s>
<s> just like giving an elbow to a fellow raver and not meaning it the struck raver shouldnt get too upset because it was not an evil intention </s>
<s> the struck raver shouldnt exaggerate the events and make a mountain out of a mole hill </s>
<s> the real problem is a misunderstanding of intentions </s>
<s> if it was perceived that i wanted to challenge mac users telling them that their macs sux then i was obviously massively misunderstood </s>
<s> i hope that you can understand my sincerity that i want to be educated and not get involved in a demeaning war </s>
<s> ive read forums about how other people bag on pcs and are doing so incorrectly but i kindly direct them to informative info so that they can fully understand the full picture </s>
<s> i would assume that if it is the case that macs are very good machines you would be able to set me straight which you have attempted to do </s>
<s> hopefully there are no hurt feelings but i would hope that the struck raver would initially quot think the best of another quot so that these quot fights quot dont emerge like they so often do </s>
<s> so i apologize that there is always that level of misunderstanding and miscommunication that comes with language especially over the internet </s>
<s> help me to love macs as you do and maybe i can be on the other side of the fence in the future </s>
<s> have a great day </s>
<s> btw im a fellow raver havent been to one in a while but im glad to hear that there are others here that enjoy those things </s>
<s> although i prefer industrial over trance check out quot porcelain and the tramps quot for a rocking underground time we can all be forgiving on the dance floor when we take a look at where the other folk are standing and respect their space </s>
<s> like i said try the disc utility in the finder window gt applications gt utilities gt disc utility path </s>
<s> select the main hard drive in the side bar and click on repair permissions at the bottom of the window </s>
<s> if you see a whole big list of repairs being made then it might indicate that this small regular maintenance has been neglected </s>
<s> repairing permissions is akin to defraging registry clean up but different and can make a rough running mac act like a new machine </s>
<s> bottom line however is a machine with so little ram isn t going to run too well </s>
<s> a gig of ram minimum is needed to run video applications smoothly </s>
<s> cheers grim </s>
