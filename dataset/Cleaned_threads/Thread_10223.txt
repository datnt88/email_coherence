<s> i have a maxtor 3100 80bg external working fine one day and now computer xp will not recognize it </s>
<s> green light is one but no sound from drive tried drive in another computer still nothing </s>
<s> some blogs said try a hard drive enclosure any thoughts </s>
<s> in the past the drive worked would warm and i could hear a hum now nothing but the green light </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> i m assuming this is in a usb external enclosure </s>
<s> if you can get it to run internally then the problem may be with the usb enclosure </s>
<s> that s the next step </s>
<s> if you have the right desktop some put that inside to avoid buying the new case </s>
