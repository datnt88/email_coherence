<s> i d hate to think they were intentional but my suspicions have been aroused </s>
<s> i recently purchased a seagate internal ultra ata 100 200 gb hard drive </s>
<s> installed in my system were two identical maxtor diamondback plus 9 160 gb ata 133 </s>
<s> copying the contents of my master to the seagate i booted up </s>
<s> that s when i got the post message quot no 80 pin conductor cable installed quot i tried both maxtor drives as slaves with the same result </s>
<s> i changed the pin settings from cs to slave with the same result </s>
<s> only when i put the two maxtor drives together again did the drives work </s>
<s> is this mere coincidence or is there a bug in one of the drivers or controllers </s>
<s> i also tried three different 80 pin connectors with the same results </s>
<s> no way can i get the seagate and maxtor drives to work together </s>
<s> i ve got some data i d very much like to get from one drive to the other but i m stumped </s>
<s> i ve used maxtor drives for years with no problems so naturally i m suspicious about seagate </s>
<s> any ideas of what may be wrong </s>
<s> are you trying to copy the entire drive or just some selected data </s>
<s> what mode is the controller set to </s>
<s> tried any other controller modes </s>
<s> re seagate and maxtor never heard of any incompatability issues </s>
<s> download seatools from seagate com to create an image of your old boot drive on the new boot drive </s>
<s> that was my question also that sounds like a copy issue to me and not a compatibility problem </s>
<s> i have a seagate and a maxtor on the same channel in my system with absolutely no problems </s>
<s> i would definitely try the seatools app works very well </s>
<s> thank you for your replies but i m starting to see the error message now even when i boot up using only the seagate drive </s>
<s> the drive still boots into windows properly though </s>
<s> i bought a wd sata 250 gb drive today and can t get my system to boot when the sata drive is connected </s>
<s> my system sees the new disk but won t boot up with my the ide drive </s>
<s> i m beginning to think i ve got a mb problem </s>
<s> i don t know enough about sata drives to know what i m doing but the manual doesn t help </s>
<s> it indicates that with both drives connected i should be able to boot off their cd </s>
<s> but i can t boot from the cd or the diskette the cd made </s>
<s> it s going to be one of those weeks </s>
<s> if anyone has any suggestions i ll check back </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> what is the computer manufacturer name and model number </s>
<s> what operating system </s>
<s> what hd currently has your os on it </s>
<s> on what hd do you wish to have the os </s>
<s> note what you have seen is expected for improperly connected hardware or improperly installed copied software </s>
<s> nothing i see is broken </s>
