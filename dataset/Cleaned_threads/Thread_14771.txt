<s> i built my own pc a couple years ago and i discovered recently that my on board usb slots are all usb 1 1 after i tried to transfer some pretty big files to a friends external hd and it took forever </s>
<s> i want to upgrade to usb 2 0 and mount it in one of my 5 25 bays so they re in the front </s>
<s> i ve priced usb 2 0 cards but before i buy one i want to make sure that it ll work right </s>
<s> does the motherboard need to support usb 2 0 for it to work at the higher speeds or can i just buy a pci card and be done with it </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> i ve used all models from newegg com geeks com and they all work in windows 2000 xp </s>
<s> i can t tell if other oses have support </s>
<s> as to the front panel usb 2 0 wiring must be used </s>
<s> cheers bob </s>
<s> if it is from a pci card your motherboard will support it </s>
<s> you can find them that go from the pci card to the front 5 25 quot bay and yes it should support it </s>
<s> i m backing the last post up </s>
