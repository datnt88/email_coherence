<s> thanks but your answer tells me nothing </s>
<s> i ve been using usb connections for 2 years and never had the problem </s>
<s> tried a regular mouse and keyboard connection with no success </s>
<s> any more suggestions </s>
<s> have a jumper that lets you reset to factory default </s>
<s> look in the dell service manual for your model on how to access and use the jumper </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> i will investigate </s>
<s> its not a usb mouse or keyboard hes talking about wireless </s>
<s> and you dont use usb because of </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> unplug the jumper on the mobo or take out the small silver battery </s>
<s> that resets it </s>
<s> 1 question though was your setup working before </s>
<s> and if so what happend to cause the problem </s>
<s> or is this a new setup for you </s>
<s> just curious </s>
<s> sounds like you changed something </s>
<s> and now you want to fix it </s>
<s> report keyboard errors gt displays keyboard errors when set to report </s>
<s> the default is report </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> no this is not a new anything </s>
<s> the anomaly just happened why i do not know </s>
<s> there is one odd item </s>
<s> a mouse hooked into the standard mouse connection does not work </s>
<s> if this is a clue to anything let me know </s>
<s> read his message </s>
<s> he clearly says usb not wireless gt </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> i m not sure what you are telling me </s>
<s> is this an avenue to correct my problem </s>
<s> use a diff keyboard just for kicks and most mobos have atleast 2 usb ports have you tried using a diff usb port </s>
<s> a standard mouse connection is ps2 if you do have a bad keyboard you need to check and see </s>
<s> try a diff keyboard </s>
<s> make sure nothing extra is plugged in except the mouse and keyboard </s>
<s> start with the basic s </s>
<s> your computer will start with out a mouse but not the keyboard or atleast not a faulty keyboard </s>
<s> try booting with just the keyboard with nothing else connected </s>
<s> it should go into windows </s>
<s> not having a mouse doesnt stop windows or your computer from working </s>
<s> if your computer starts with just a keyboard </s>
<s> then cool </s>
<s> if it doesnt then you know your keyboard is faulty and may not be mouse problem at all </s>
<s> if your computer starts with the keyboard then turn off and plug in the mouse </s>
<s> have you reset the bios as in my other post </s>
<s> all of your suggestions are great but are not relevent since i have tried all of your suggestions with no success </s>
<s> no i haven t reset the bios yet but i will </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> so you tried booting with just the keyboard and it worked ok </s>
<s> the only prob you have is getting into the bios </s>
<s> so take side panel of your case and pull the batt and leave out for about 30seconds then put back in </s>
<s> and before you boot up just use keyboard and mouse </s>
<s> the bios settings for reporting keyboard failure is set to enable by default </s>
<s> this setting needs to be changed to disable </s>
<s> if i remember correctly you have tried a ps2 kb with the same error </s>
<s> if this is so you may have a damaged port </s>
<s> bill </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> will check do </s>
<s> and there lies the problem of using usb especial for keyboard function </s>
