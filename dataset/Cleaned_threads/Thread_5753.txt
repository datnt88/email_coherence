<s> hello i ve just bought an external hdd for back up and large file storage </s>
<s> it has two firewire plugs and one usb2 </s>
<s> i m very happy with it s functioning over the usb connector </s>
<s> my concern is however how can i protect this external data from access through connection to any other computer </s>
<s> i do not want to also for time reasons encrypt every byte that is stored on it </s>
<s> i have heard of little safety keys with some incorporated encryption on it that has to be inserted in one of the plugs of the hdd </s>
<s> searching on the net i ve not found what i was looking for can somebody help </s>
<s> thanks for your reply </s>
<s> be careful what you ask for </s>
<s> i ve seen people encrypt their data into oblivion </s>
<s> just for discussion this feature is going to be on newer usb drives from what i hear from maxtor and such external drive makers </s>
<s> for the d i y crowd you have a lot of options </s>
<s> just be sure you don t create some black hole which you put data into </s>
<s> today s knowledge of black hole is that nothing comes out </s>
<s> and what is coming out doesn t seem to be useful yet </s>
<s> i do know of an usb key for encrypting data but an user lost theirs and along with it their data </s>
<s> they had no backup and the company that makes it tells them that quot that s how its supposed to work quot if you could crack it and recover your data then we would have to improve it </s>
<s> got it </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> thanks for your information </s>
<s> would there be a way locking the external hdd with a code for example that information obviously stored on the latter so any other computer could not connect to that hdd </s>
<s> i mentioned maxtor and others are doing a method but not that </s>
<s> until then d i y solutions are what you can try </s>
<s> no standards here </s>
<s> i m unsure of your skill or how long you ve used a pc but if you used winzip and an passworded zip file you could drop files on that </s>
<s> remember it s not ultra secure if you pay for unlocking via if you could write how far out you need to go and if you are willing to lose the data if the key soft or hard is lost then i ll get an idea where the security bar height needs to be set </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> hi bob i have no goverment secrets so the security level does not have to be very high </s>
<s> it s more in case of theft that i do not wish others to access my privat files </s>
<s> i m a photographer i store mainly digital pictures and video files on it that are rather large in filesize </s>
<s> that is why i do not wish to encrypt them beacause it takes ages but i need to access them quickly without any major time issue </s>
<s> i wouldn t mind a digital key solution usually you get 2 keys and i m not afraid of loss </s>
<s> something you would use like a pass through key with some password that does not encrypt the whole file but just blocks its access </s>
<s> thanks sidney </s>
<s> the key method is known to you and the risks </s>
<s> it matters not in the grand scheme if the whole file or block of access unless that s your quot specification quot in which case we need to rewind this to the top and really grind through what products you know about and what i know about </s>
<s> then see which fits your spec </s>
<s> an example usb key product is but you don t get two keys and if you buy a second key it won t let you access the files </s>
<s> they and others don t offer data recovery services </s>
<s> you must be aware of the risks </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> lock it xpress to secure folders </s>
<s> it can only password protect folders will not lock most system program files </s>
<s> the only way to access secured folders is though lock it xpress </s>
<s> lock it xpress is simple to use virtually uses no system resources only 8 kb and is available free at but if you foreget the password foreget your secured folders </s>
