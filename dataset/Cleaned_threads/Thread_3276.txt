<s> i have been considering to buy a netbook for basic applications like web browsing downloading stuff download a lot of movies watching movies and listening to music typing and editing documents i am considering dell mini sony vaoi vpcm126ag p and hp mini 210series my prime concerns are would a netbook be able to pull maximum internet speeds </s>
<s> i am currently using a broadband internet connection of 1mbps </s>
<s> how much of multitasking can it handle </s>
<s> for instance how comfortably can it pull web browsing with multiple tabs on editing documents a download in progress while a movie is running simultaneously </s>
<s> could you name a few softwares that are likely to bringdown its performance the ones i better steer clear of please help me decide if netbook is a good choice at all thanks a ton </s>

<s> netbooks are fine but you describe using one just like a full sized laptop </s>
<s> given a full sized laptop is the same or not much more price why would you sacrifice your hands and eyes to a netbook </s>

<s> i am looking for something very light and portable </s>
<s> something like the old gateway ex1440u </s>
<s> it s one step up and away from a netbook and what i use on travel when i don t have to do much </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> netbooks have their place they are not supposed to replace an upscale laptop i have one i use when travelling they are easily carried at airports can access wifi while waiting also use in hotel room to check email look up stuff on web etc </s>
<s> a netbook is not supposed to be for long correspondence lengthy emails etc the thing to look for in a netbook is to be sure it is upgradeable to 2 gb </s>
<s> thats the first thing i did </s>
<s> makes 100 difference in performance </s>
<s> the other thing is the keyboard there are differences in how far the keys are apart spaced which helps in input </s>
<s> other wise dell h p acer whatever are all about the same you could say its a difference between a loaded larger laptop and a pda or an email net capable cellphone bottom line again is what are you going to use it for </s>
<s> sc </s>
<s> i m with bob on this one you can pick up a full function notebook that isn t dramatically heavier or much more expensive than a netbook and get a better screen for watching movies and a more capable multi threading processor intel core rather than atom </s>
<s> your specific questions will a netbook handle maximum internet sppeds </s>
<s> probably not but it will have no problem at all with your 1 mbps </s>
<s> how much multitasking can it handle </s>
<s> your list looks too heavy to me you d be much better off with an intel core processor than an atom that sacrifices performance for lighter weight of the whole unit and battery life </s>
<s> i am trying out an acer aspire with 1g ram 250g memory </s>
<s> it is very very slow the touchpad is very skittish no matter how i adjust it and it simple is not powerful enough to have multiple screens open </s>
<s> i m extremely disappointed and am returning it i purchased on a tv shopping channel that gives me that ability to return with no restocking fee </s>
<s> but i do like the portability and long battery life </s>
<s> there is an hp pavilion dm1z that has an 11 6 quot screen 3g ram 320g hard drive and you can select a turion dual core processor for about 525 </s>
<s> it only weighs in at 3 25 lbs </s>
<s> according to specs </s>
<s> i m seriously considering this purchase since i would be able to multi task not be so frustrated by slowness and still have portability </s>
