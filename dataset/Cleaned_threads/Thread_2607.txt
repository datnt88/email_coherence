<s> i just moved to a new apartment with two cable internet wall jacks </s>
<s> the one in my room didn t seem to be working so i ran a cable to the other jack my roommate s and i can access the net fine with that one </s>
<s> i called the apartment complex s tech people and they sent a guy with his laptop </s>
<s> he proceded to connect his laptop to the jack in my room and it worked for him </s>
<s> he then told me i probably had a faulty network card and should buy a new one </s>
<s> but every store i ve been to said it s probably a settings related problem </s>
<s> thoughts </s>
<s> i m running winxp and have had my network card for about 3 years </s>
<s> it s a netgear fa311 fast ethernet adapter </s>
<s> on the box it says it is compatible with xp but the documentation inside makes no mention of xp compatibility </s>
<s> any help is appreciated </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> that your pc will work from your roommate s jack but not from yours </s>
<s> can his machine connect from your jack </s>
<s> bad cable perhaps </s>
<s> well i have tried with two cables thus far </s>
<s> the thing is they both seemed to work for the tech guy when he plugged his laptop in </s>
<s> my roommate isn t moving in till tuesday so i haven t checked with his computer yet </s>
<s> multiple components is often a process of elimination </s>
<s> you verify ones peice of hardwares workability and whittle it down to the troubled device </s>
