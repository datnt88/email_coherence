<s> in my home we have a wireless internet connection </s>
<s> i m not sure it s a network because we don t do file sharing and i m not sure if i understand this part </s>
<s> anyways on my computer a dell inspiron 600m i have two internet icons in the lower right hand corner a single computer that shows it s got signal strength and the double computer icon for the lan </s>
<s> when i had computer problems several months ago i called dell and they told me to disable the lan connection and work with the single computer connection </s>
<s> my roommate sister s connection is the same she uses the single computer icon as well </s>
<s> is this correct first of all </s>
<s> secondly can we disable the double icon so we don t see it in the taskbar </s>
<s> please forgive me if i m asking a really basic question or not being clear </s>
<s> the other thing is that during our computer problems the dell rep told us to make our ip addresses the same </s>
<s> they are now and both computers run more slowly when we are online at the same time </s>
<s> is there any way to repair this </s>
<s> and last but not least our router icon often pops up in the taskbar with a yellow exclamation point and says quot not connected quot </s>
<s> how can we fix this </s>
<s> should we be using the lan network and can we fix the problem with the ip addresses so we both get a strong signal at the appropriate speed cable connection </s>
<s> sorry for the long post and thanks for any help you can offer </s>
<s> i m willing to learn how to do this i just need walked through step by step </s>
<s> the physical configuration of your home network </s>
<s> are there 2 computers using a wireless router the router being connected to an external modem </s>
<s> first i am going to make a couple of assumptions </s>
<s> the quot lower right hand corner quot i am going to assume you mean the system tray where the clock is located </s>
<s> second i am going to assume that you remember how to change a few settings on your computers and on your router </s>
<s> also that you will understand some of the terminology i use </s>
<s> if this is not the case then i would suggest you hire a professional to fix your problems as it will be cheaper in the long run in furstration and time at least </s>
<s> first off having two computers with the same ip address is a vary bad way to operate </s>
<s> each computer should have its own ip address </s>
<s> the computers should be set to automatically retrive an ip address from your router which should be using dhcp to distribute the ip addresses </s>
<s> second if you are not using the lan connection the one designated by two computers then you should have no problems with having it disabled </s>
<s> third you do have a network </s>
<s> it doesn t matter if you have file sharing etc </s>
<s> any two computers connected through a central point and on the same subnet mask are a network </s>
<s> ok to disable the lan icon on your sister s computer go start gt control panel gt network connections right click on local area connection then left click properties </s>
<s> this will bring up a dialog box </s>
<s> at the bottom of the dialog there are two checkboxes </s>
<s> uncheck the top one and the icon will go away after you click ok to exit the dialog box </s>
<s> for the slow connection not connected problem first open the router and confirm that you are using dhcp </s>
<s> i can t tell you how to do this since i don t know what router and software you are using </s>
<s> you need to make sure that the router is assigning ip addresses automatically </s>
<s> the single computer icon you mentioned is the wireless connection </s>
<s> to set automatic ip for this connection right click on the wireless connection single computer with antenna icon and left click properties </s>
<s> scroll down the list under quot this connection uses the following items quot to internet protocol tcp ip and click once </s>
<s> then click the properties button on the right side just below the list of items </s>
<s> make sure that the general tab is active and that the two clickbuttons for automatic operation are clicked </s>
<s> ok to exit and ok to exit the connection properties </s>
<s> reboot and this will set the computer to automatic ip function </s>
<s> you might need to do this with both computers </s>
<s> post back if you have problems or need more information if you are at all uncomfortable with doing this typle of setup on your system i would suggest getting someone who is experienced in this area to perform the adjustments </s>
<s> there may also be issues that i don t know about that will cause my instructions to fail </s>
<s> due to the nature of the forum discussion without more information this would be the best i can do </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> first thank you so much for your detailed and patient explanation </s>
<s> a few things i am using the dell truemobile 1184 router </s>
<s> i can tell you my software if you tell me where to look </s>
<s> if you just mean my version of windows i use xp pro </s>
<s> i went into control panel re lan properties and the top checkbox was already unchecked </s>
<s> i unchecked the lower box to notify me when this connection has limited or no connectivity and the double computer icon was still there </s>
<s> any suggestions </s>
<s> i know how to go in and disable it but it gets obnoxious doing it every time i turn on my computer </s>
<s> secondly i saw on the troubleshooting icon in the router that the ssid should be the same on the computers as what the router has </s>
<s> well it s titled beck instead of wireless case sensitive like the instructions say it should </s>
<s> when i try to change it it wants a password and i don t know where we got that password </s>
<s> we are currently looking for documentation to find the password to enable us to change the name to wireless and then we can check to see if it is using dhcp </s>
<s> the other thing is both computers already had automatic settings checked for the ip address but they both list 192 168 2 1 as the ip address </s>
<s> any more ideas suggestions </s>
<s> i really appreciate the help </s>
<s> two computers on a wireless network with the router connected to an external modem </s>
<s> at this point i don t think that there is anything more i can help with </s>
<s> it looks to me like the problems you are experiencing are related to your router setup and i would suggest you get someone experienced in networking to assist you in person since the problems you are having are beyond what i think can be solved through this forum </s>
<s> it looks to me like your problems are in the router setup not so much in the computers </s>
<s> you are correct the ssid should be the same </s>
<s> if not then you aren t even connecting to your router </s>
<s> if you don t know the password to get into your router then you will have to reset it and that is beyond my experience </s>
<s> i won t willingly use dell products so i can t be of assistance with them </s>
<s> you might however try a username of admin and a blank password </s>
<s> also find the documentation for the router either online or physically and try to default username and password </s>
<s> also take one of your computers re enable the lan connection and connect it physically to the router with a lan cable </s>
<s> disable the wireless connection and use this setup to do all your configuration </s>
<s> if you are attempting to do the setup and are connected to another router instead of your own it will be a little difficult to do any further troubleshooting </s>
<s> once you have all the settings correct with a cable then connect with the other laptop wirelessly and make sure that everything is working </s>
<s> sorry i can t be of more help </s>
