<s> i m fairly new at setting up networks and could use some advice with this setup </s>
<s> i ve accomplished a wireless setup on 5 machines but that s about the extent of my hands on experience </s>
<s> i would like to network three machines for file sharing </s>
<s> they all access the same t 1 line </s>
<s> 2 machines running windows 98se </s>
<s> 1 machine running xp home </s>
<s> i would like for the xp machine to be the host </s>
<s> i ve read about different methods for setting this up </s>
<s> frankly it s a little confusing to a novice </s>
<s> i would like to hear from those of you who have experience with t 1 line network setup </s>
<s> also what if any hardware is needed </s>
<s> router switch etc </s>
<s> thanks for any suggestions </s>
<s> ernie </s>
<s> since i ve gotten no response to this post i thought i would answer my own questions </s>
<s> i set up the network using the netbuie protocol with printer file sharing </s>
<s> the xp machine required a different configuration and the extracting of some files from the xp cd but it all came together and works great </s>
<s> i ve got two computers running on wireless g that can share a printer and two that are on wireless b cards that cannot share the same printer </s>
<s> do all the computers need to be on wireless g to share the printer </s>
<s> i wireless b capable of printer sharing </s>
<s> thought you might be able to help </s>
<s> make sure all the pcs are identified with the same workgroup name </s>
<s> if the printer is connected to a pc versus a print server port on the router switch you may need to be sure that each user has an account to which the printer is connected </s>
<s> i used to have a router switch with a printer port on it which meant any pc on the network could print to it at any time </s>
<s> i replaced the printer and my new one only connects by usb to the pc </s>
<s> i had to replace the r s and now the main pc has to be on for the others to be able to print </s>
