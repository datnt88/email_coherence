<s> this was working fine </s>
<s> but now i can t see the files on my laptop from my desktop </s>
<s> when i try to display other pc s in my workgroup i get an error mshome is not accessible </s>
<s> you might not have permission to use this network resource </s>
<s> contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions </s>
<s> the list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available </s>
<s> i recently installed kaspersky anti virus after mcafee expired </s>
<s> but i ve turned off the kaspersky firewall and am using windows firewall </s>
<s> there is says file sharing is allowed </s>
<s> but anyway i tried turning off all firewalls on both laptop and desktop and problem persists </s>
<s> i ve been through network wizard several times on both machines and check file and printer sharing allowed </s>
<s> printer sharing still seems to work but not file sharing </s>
<s> looking for any suggestion before re installing windows from scratch </s>
<s> another member had a similar issue </s>
<s> with their quot suite quot the firewall was off but still working to block file sharing </s>
<s> they had to uninstall the suite to remove the block </s>
<s> this is a common bug in suites </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you were exactly right </s>
<s> i had to completely remove kaspersky pos from both desktop and laptop and file shareing started working again </s>
<s> fortunately mcafee 2008 just became available and i ve installed it and file sharing still works </s>
<s> so i m good for a year until that sub expires </s>
