<s> i was ready to buy a 22 inch lg lcd monitor that doubles as a television </s>
<s> it is 1080p ready and has analog and digital tv tuner </s>
<s> i thought it was great when one of my collegues proposed to sell me his 36 37 inch lg tv second hand at a very good price </s>
<s> will this be an acceptable good computer monitor </s>
<s> i have a hp 2510p notebook which i plan to hook it up to will it work with it </s>
<s> will it be any different with a regular lcd monitor </s>
<s> will it have a glare problem if i do reading with it </s>
<s> is it ok to buy a 1 1 5 year old lcd tv at half present market price </s>
<s> would it be outdated in a general sense </s>
<s> any tips to make it work at its best whether monitor or tv </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> if it s a 720p tv most likely set the resolution for either 1366x768 or 1280x720 </s>
<s> if it s a 1080p tv then set it for 1920x1080 </s>
<s> as for glare that depends on where you ll be using it and how it s positioned </s>
<s> you should place a tv that size at least 3 ft from your eyes much further than a 22 quot or you may cause eyestrain and have to move your neck head too much to see the full image </s>
<s> if your colleague s tv has matching inputs it ll work fine </s>
<s> use the vga out on your laptop a standard vga dsub cable </s>
<s> a heads up resolution on tvs is lower than computer monitors in the sense of pixel size </s>
<s> which is just fine because we usually sit next to our computers but view tv from a distance </s>
<s> so it s not any different than a regular lcd monitor but it is what it is </s>
<s> 1080 lines is great for tv not going to be crystal sharp up close as a computer monitor at that scale </s>
<s> for a business mobile style laptop even a 19 quot monitor will feel like a nice big screen when working at a desk so i m confident you d like the 22 quot lg too </s>
<s> but hey bigger is better eh </s>
