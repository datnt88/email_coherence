<s> i m looking to get a new computer soon and i have a lot of files i want to move between my old and new computer about 60 gb worth </s>
<s> i was looking into ways to do that and found out about crossover cables but then found out there s a lot of set up involved i e quot you can t just connect two computers and expect them to share files right away quot </s>
<s> i m wondering if the belkin easytransfer cable is better because it does have a plug and play aspect to it </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> i no longer use the ethernet crossover cable as most new machines have auto mdx see google </s>
<s> setup and use of windows easy transfer has no involved or quot lot of quot set up </s>
<s> we plug a cable from the old to the new machine run easy transfer on each machine and enter some 6 digit number and then check off the items we want moved </s>
<s> what could be easier </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> you will now have two pcs </s>
<s> never gonna use that old one again </s>
<s> never want to get quot on line quot with it </s>
<s> get a router </s>
<s> connect the two to the router and turn on file and printer sharing on the pcs </s>
<s> you can do everything you want and have two surfing pcs </s>
