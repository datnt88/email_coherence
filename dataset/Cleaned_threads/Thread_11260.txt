<s> ok so i have a hp with vista home premium and i m trying to record a bunch of lp s to digital </s>
<s> the desktop has 2 l r composite audio jacks one in the front one in the back </s>
<s> i have searched everywhere trying to find out how to record through the composite jacks but everything says to get an adapter and record through the 3 5mm jack </s>
<s> but i don t really want to buy an adapter when there are already 2 composite jacks on the computer </s>
<s> i don t know why they re on the computer if they don t have a purpose </s>
<s> does anyone know how to access these ports for recording </s>
<s> all you need is 1 cable </s>
<s> cable if you are using a stereo receiver you will need a y cable the v part is 2 rca male and the other end is a cable looking like your stereo headphone for your portable cd player </s>
<s> note that there are 2 line on the lower part of this plug the 2 lines means stereo 1 line means mono </s>
<s> you want stereo </s>
<s> check your record player and see what the output or audio out jack looks like </s>
<s> how to plug in the cable on the stereo receiver or record player plug usually it is a rca jack the cable into audio out left and right of the player </s>
<s> left stands for left speaker right stands for right speaker </s>
<s> the other end usually a 1 pin looks like your portable stereo headphone jack stereo male cable note the 2 line on the tip of the pin the 2 line stands for stereo please correct me if i am wrong </s>
<s> next you will need software that can help you do the sound transfer </s>
<s> this will be real time so patience is a must </s>
<s> 1st do a little test test a few seconds of recording then play it back if all ok then do the whole song </s>
<s> or unless you just bought a turn table with usb plug </s>
<s> this is a new technology that can be used to do lp conversion </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> i know all about the y connector and where to plug it in that s what i read everywhere i look </s>
<s> on the tower there are composite audio input jacks i don t want to use the line in and for some reason i can t figure out how to utilize them to record my stuff </s>
<s> and i already have recording software </s>
<s> there are various different flavours of record players but most will need a phono box </s>
<s> there are some budget modern decks which have this built in to output a line out suitable for jacking into a computer amp etc but the vast majority of record decks require pre amplification and equalisation </s>
<s> and we aren t talking about to get it to work best or for best sound we are talking about just getting the connection to work in the first place </s>
<s> there are phono boxes and there are phono boxes but the cheapest way is to use your integrated amplifier i e </s>
<s> most likely the amp you had the record player plugged into originally </s>
<s> using the tape out of the integrated amp connected to the pc you can record the preamplified signal of the record deck </s>
<s> if you want to get fancier easier this one for example has a usb output so you can plug it directly into a usb socket of the pc </s>
<s> this saves you having to mess around with volumes too much and will offer the best conversion since the signal is already digital when it enters your computer </s>
<s> you re getting various terms mixed up so it s hard to tell but if the composite jacks you re talking about are yellow then they re for the teevee </s>
<s> not audio video </s>
<s> the problem is with the computer not the record player the jacks are red and white right and left and i have an amplifier i just can t figure out how to access those jacks in vista </s>
<s> your recording software should be able to choose between inputs </s>
<s> or go into control panel type sounds into the search field click on the sounds panel when it appears go into the recording tab and chooose the device </s>
<s> there is a signal bar on the right hand side of each device and if you select it and test playback your record player you should be able to see which is which </s>
<s> i m not sure if you ve found the answer to this since it s an older post however the reason you haven t been able to locate these jacks in your recording software or anything is because they are part of your tv tuner not the sound board </s>
<s> so i really doubt you would be able to record any kind of audio from them without a coupled video signal </s>
<s> hope that helped </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> i have experienced a similar problem with these jacks however i am trying to hook my ps3 up to my pc using the composite and av jacks that you are talking about on the front </s>
<s> the problem is that vista has no bundled software to tackle such a task and therefor you are forced into using 3rd party software unstable that hasn t been tested with all hardware </s>
<s> this basically mean vista developers hp hardware dumb </s>
