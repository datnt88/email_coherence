<s> i have 1 gig of memory and a 200 gig hard drive there seems to be many choices just not sure which one would be best </s>
<s> thanks in advance for your reply </s>
<s> notes this has the x16 pci express slot so you can t go get some agp card </s>
<s> you ll have to pick an pci express card based on how far out you want to go </s>
<s> ati has a dual gpu video card with 1 gigabyte of video ram but that is on the extreme side of upgrades </s>
<s> your choice is usually determined by a budget </s>

<s> many of the graphix card manufacturers can scan your system on line </s>
<s> go that way </s>
