<s> i had burned a dvd with some important files </s>
<s> but the problem is now it doesnot show these files at all </s>
<s> though it says that it occupies 2 38 gb of 4 38 gb there are no files at all </s>
<s> ho can i view these files </s>
<s> please help me as these files are very important for me </s>
<s> if i use some dvd media as a drive software then when i take this dvd to another machine the files are missing </s>
<s> back to the machine i created it on and my files show </s>
<s> why is that </s>
<s> it happens because the machine that it worked on has special drivers called filters that enable use to see and write to the dvd media as if it was a slow hard drive </s>
<s> i discourage use of such titles for the very reason you posted </s>
<s> if you can supply the title of software you used or if you used the native os feature we can look into how to get at the files on other pcs </s>
<s> for now you can look up isobuster and see if it sees the files </s>

<s> sometimes dvd writer media is not accepts dvd they burn data not show data just check your dvd writer on service center or try on another dvd writer </s>
<s> i am having this same problem for five years </s>
<s> some of the dvds that i can see the files mainly pix and video clips read cdfs under properties and others say udf </s>
<s> i used roxio easy creator and roxio instaled limited version and nero and even a few free downloaded dvd burners </s>
<s> this is not a good idea to use different software burners as they tend to purpusely want to make you buy their repair products </s>
<s> folk can use or not use such things </s>
