<s> d link s dph 50u works as advertised for most users but be warned that it does not work for all users </s>
<s> in my case the initial installation and setup went well and the device performed as expected </s>
<s> however later in the day my computer no longer recognized the device and i lost several of my usb connections concurrently </s>
<s> after some time the dph 50u reports device no present and shows the red not connected icon in ones system tray </s>
<s> in xp sp2 running devmgmt msc shows unknown device under universal serial bus controllers </s>
<s> an internet search to solve this problem illuminated the fact that the d link dph 50u is not a standard usb device </s>
<s> the installation software creates a unique usb setup which in my case has proven problematic </s>
<s> those unknown device entries were previously fully functioning usb devices now belly up </s>
<s> the only solution i have found was discovered here d link must know of this situation as it has been previously reported i discovered it by googling d link quot device not recognized quot </s>
<s> d link support none </s>
<s> i ve phoned and emailed and have had one response </s>
<s> here is that response your case id is dlk397773915 </s>
<s> what is the issue that you are having </s>
<s> i will take care of any of the issues that you are having with the dph 50u </s>
<s> my reply has been ignored and i have heard nothing further </s>
<s> what is the best method to proceed </s>
<s> it s unlikely to be a dlink problem but a pc issue </s>
<s> dlink won t help you fix your pc and i can t comment further since nothing is told about the pc </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the solution that you posted had nothing to do with d link </s>
<s> you have a motherboard operating system issue that is keeping a d link product from working </s>
<s> the issue had nothing to do with your d link product </s>
<s> it had to do with your usb port </s>
<s> that is like complaining to cheveron about there gas pumps when there is an issue with the fuel filling port on you toyota </s>
<s> i tried googling d link quot device not recognized quot and only found 257 entries </s>
<s> not bad for such a big company </s>
<s> you would think they would have a lot more considering how many products they must sell in a month </s>
<s> not to mention that tech support is not free </s>
<s> it is for you as a customer but d link has to pay somebody to talk to you </s>
<s> you are expecting that d link should trouble shoot an issue with your motherboard and os </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> call microsoft </s>
<s> call whoever made your motherboard pc </s>
<s> no surprise i get the same problem with d link i stopped using them because their products are flakey and support is simply not satisfactory like they dont even care </s>
